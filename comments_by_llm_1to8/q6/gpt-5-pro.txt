  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the researcher notices vents, gradients, coherence, beats. Vocabulary is precise and voice-consistent ("lepidopteran air," "closed wild arithmetic"). Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style is clean. One dialogue exchange with the botanist is brief, functional, and voice-appropriate. Figurative language intensifies under pressure without obscuring clarity: "riverbeds left in the air," "butterflies taught to write." Minor note: the repeated "decay" and "slope" terms approach saturation in the final third but remain legible and purpose-driven rather than looped.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV first-person narration maintains consistent distance and a glass artist's perceptual signature: heat/cooling, breath/exhale, luminous/shadow. Diction stays within the artist's plausible lexicon, blending craft terms with lyric compression ("canyon listened," "frost is a quiet cartographer"). Purposeful elision of the "attempt" details in opening serves closure when the chamber reveals the mentor's refuge and the fire's true motive. One friction: the phrase "drifting resonance" appears twice verbatim (penultimate and final paragraphs), a minor template echo that slightly flattens the ending's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV remains stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature ("frost gardens bloom under skylights like silent constellations"). The narrator's lexicon—maritime, musical, attentive to texture—fits a survivor turned archivist. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: compressed memory at the ferry, expansive reflection during project work, immediate sensation at closure. Minor register drift: "rectify distances between heartbeats" and "cognitively smoothness" nudge toward elevated diction, but the slips do not obscure the narrator's voice or the closure beat. No dialogue appears; Sura's gestural language is described, not quoted, maintaining tight focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person throughout, distance held, perceptual signature distinct (undertaker's idiom: "sexton," "plot under grass," "occupancy"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "chased stillness," "coordinates insist," "corridor, not a wall." Free indirect moments are clean. Minor dings: a few elevated phrases ("inadvertently stubborn," "reciprocal act") edge toward register drift from the otherwise tactile voice, and "folded velvet" in the opening feels slightly ornamental. Rhythm modulates well with pressure—short declaratives at the descent, longer syntactic waves during the catalog work. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of the descent mechanics) is legible under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    First-person plural ("we") is controlled as a single collective stance; no head-hopping into individuated interiorities occurs. Perceptual signature is consistent: lyric, compression-heavy, and metaphor-dense ("stars floating in it like distant coins," "breath and echo"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext. Psychic distance is stable. Under peak stress (the food run), diction remains voice-consistent. One minor filter-verb cluster ("watched the stars tremble," "listened," "looked") in the arbor scene does not materially dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance and a distinct lyric-mystical texture. Diction is elevated and metaphor-dense ("breathing lantern," "pilgrim of sparks," "ocean" lungs) but remains voice-motivated and legible. The narrator's perceptual signature—spiritual, image-focused, attentive to light and breath—is consistent. Dialogue is absent. The prose modulates slightly with emotional intensity (shorter clauses when the aperture opens, longer when reflecting on memory), but the register and rhythm remain uniform across pressure points, reducing dynamic range. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "cambium kept slick and new" and "birds nested above and beneath at once," details filtered through professional and temporal obsession. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("quaking reverie," "mylar ghosts," "gill") with voice modulating under pressure (shorter clauses when the fragment pulses, longer when reflecting). One brief register slip: "retrocognitively trapped" feels clinical amid otherwise lyric phrasing, though it recovers quickly. No dialogue is present; focalization remains clean throughout, and the prose rhythm matches emotional intensity (breath-held syntax during the fragment's release, steadier cadence at closure).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "patiently strategic," "staggering grace," sensory filters shaped by urgency and memory. Diction is character-specific ("like a swallow's apology," "constellation of small hardness") and modulates under pressure without losing texture. Dialogue is brief, purposeful, and goal-driven ("I tell them the wall is gone..."). Psychic distance shifts intentionally (grandmother's stories deepen present stakes). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctive, with a consistent lyric-technical register ("cochlear organoids beside apple scions," "spectral notch of retreat") that reflects the protagonist's audiology expertise and synesthetic perception. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter obscures immediacy. The father's brief dialogue ("trusted me… trusted himself") carries subtext without over-explanation. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist notices sound-as-color, absences, and auroral hues in character-specific ways. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the confrontation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is distinct and poetically compressed ("a dark aquarium glowing with petals," "minnows testing a river mouth"), but the register is uniformly elevated—vocabulary and syntax rarely modulate under pressure, flattening urgency. POV is stable first-person, though the temporal loop introduces a mild focalization puzzle (how does the narrator know the future self's memory?). Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early, but diction stays in one key throughout, missing the rhythmic tightening or sensory narrowing that would mark peak stress. No dialogue appears; the piece relies entirely on narration and reported gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "We do not blow to impress, we blow to listen" and the theatrical self-narration ("Cue the oxygen") establish a consistent perceptual signature. Free indirect thought is clean, and the bookmark's "taste of old oil and library dust" grounds reflection in sensory present. Reflection percentage exceeds 30% but every beat anchors in present action (lighting lamp, opening valve, rolling rod) and micro-choices alter tactics (singing to the generator, counting breaths), satisfying the BRR expanded mode. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: "breath keeps arguing with itself," "making shelter out of whatever breaks me," "the stars hold steadier in the dark, and so do I." Perceptual signature is consistent (stunt coordinator idiom, movement awareness, exits as halos). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You never would have been Jax... only the body that bruises" / "Yes, but mine"). Figurative language density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register drift in "composite truth" and "constellation learning to pronounce my name" nudges slightly elevated diction, but it reads intentional and does not obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single first-person POV is stable and apt; the scribe's perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic obsession, memory of father's pier, attention to silence and distance). Diction is purposeful and voice-distinct: "marbled hush," "syruped quietude," "shore arrived in the flesh," "wind paced… like a tired animal." The oracle's direct speech carries distinct idiom ("edges begin at the ear," "rooms, not limits") and the scribe's internal register modulates under pressure without losing texture. Minor slip: "men stepping softer as if not to bruise the unwritten" and "tie their gear with gentler fingers" risk abstraction, and the final paragraph's stacked clauses ("We waited… We set… Wind paced") compress closure beats in a way that slightly flattens the scribe's interior charge. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    JN-3's perceptual signature is robot-specific and distinct: maintenance logs, "composure holds the dust together," sounds as "footprints that refused snow," the map of private estuary. Diction remains consistent—technical but not cold, curious without anthropomorphic cheer—and modulates under pressure (shorter lines when bowing the violin, lyric expansion in the final paragraph). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The piece teaches its compression and patterned syntax early ("I sweep the choices afterward") and sustains the voice through reflection without voice leakage. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I realized," "I decided") are acceptable within this reflective mode but cluster slightly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("rain left the museum steps humming like bowls"), purposeful parallelism ("I answered to everything nights"), and perceptual signature (a curator notices "seams" and "glints"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The phrase "after words become unnecessary" recurs as frame rather than filter clutter, teaching the pattern early and paying it off at closure. Minor density concern: some lines ("He answered to nobody nights, and I answered to everything nights") approach decorative antithesis without advancing pressure, but the texture supports the Accumulative lens and the final image integrates rhythm with content.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: the syntax mirrors deliberate, patient thought ("I polish them by moonlight and by morning light"), and diction remains within the vine dresser's idiom (twine, trellis, sap). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The reflective register is consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("blooming withering") legible at closure. One dialogue exchange with the Auditor carries subtext (aligned to oldest scars vs. latest indices) and advances the proof without filter-verb stacking. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. Minor drift: "commemorating small victories elaborately" and "refuses to shrink" edge toward elevated diction but remain character-plausible given the narrator's self-aware pedagogical stance. No template cadence or convergence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Hale; distance modulates purposefully (closer during lever operation, wider during Sera's observation). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("coiled quietly," "hush colored field," "subdued awakenings") without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but functional, advancing plot and carrying subtext ("Early is safer," "sideways or not, what mattered was how gently you invited dawn"). Perceptual signature is Hale-specific: mechanic's precision blended with poetic attention. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains voice coherence under pressure, though some metaphoric density ("tilted page," "angular river") risks slight opacity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: musical metaphors (fermatas, harmonics, unstruck chords), technical vocabulary (rosin, bow hair, viola case), and a bias toward listening over speaking. Distance is controlled—narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows, with inference marked as such ("I preferred to think"). Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure: "consummately placed," "mirrored mine," "shallow water and unspoken gratitude." Minor slip: "lately inspired by an anxiety I could not play away" edges toward diagnostic phrasing, though it's brief and recovers quickly into embodied action. No head-hopping; the ghost's interiority is never claimed, only her effects.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; perceptual signature is technical yet grief-soaked ("auroral sorrow," "swaying certainties," oracle clicks as "teeth reconsidering a bite"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent: "outgassing clicks," "glide plane," "microtremor," "desiccant scale" anchor occupational specificity. The oracle's anthropomorphization ("if a machine can say anything") reads as narrator projection rather than head-hopping. Minor slip: "the oracle notices my stare" briefly imports first-person certainty into the machine's awareness; tightening to "I imagine it notices" would preserve psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: compression, sensory metaphor ("warm weight like another hand"), and diction that blends industrial grit with lyric precision ("prayer gulped at daylight," "liturgy made of rust"). POV distance is controlled—first-person interiority remains character-bound, and perceptual signature (surveyor's eye, skeptic's appraisal) filters every image. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming in on the wheel's beads, pulling back to hear the factory ghost shift's "invisible crank"). Brief elision (mother's confession content, the exact nature of prior mapping) serves compression and pays off when the ledger fills in gaps. One minor slip: "They call me a reckless abandoned-mill explorer" reads slightly externalized for a first-person narrator who otherwise inhabits immediate perception, though it establishes character efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: "vines like belts," "water kneels to mirror and forget," "foxed the leather." Diction is elevated but consistent, rooted in the keeper's archival idiom. The brief dialogue with the child is naturalistic and purposeful. Under pressure (the vaults thrumming), syntax tightens appropriately. However, the piece occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the opportunity of each moment to be itself") that slightly loosens the perceptual signature. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person POV is stable and voice-particular: "I travel light and listen heavy," "attention shaped like tone," "voices never leave, they only change addresses." Perceptual signature is professional-sensory (sound, breath, rhythm dominate). Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—slightly poetic but grounded in therapeutic idiom. Minor slips: "tears that did not fall, held like stars at dawn" edges toward elevated register in a high-pressure beat, and a few filter verbs ("I felt the pulse") soften immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Lena's whispered lines and the therapist's assurances carry subtext. No mid-paragraph tense or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyric, formally elevated, and sustained across all beats with consistent diction ("coin-clink," "bruised by smoke," "tiny rainstorms"). POV remains stable single-perspective with deep access to the historian's perceptual signature (sensitively perceptive ear). Psychic distance is controlled; the historian's knowledge and inference stay within his expertise. One friction: under the accumulative pressure of the ending, the syntax maintains identical formal register without modulation—"bronze quiet shifted, deepening like a bell beginning to understand"—where compression or rhythmic break might sharpen the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mei's perceptual signature (seeing flow, dots, orchestration) is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a lyric, oracular cadence that modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext ("Your light again" / "Mine too"). Distance control is clean; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage. The voice texture (staff lines, metronome, glass cathedral) sustains specificity and rhythm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV (Ruan's perspective) is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and lyric: "decorates the air," "breath was loud in the rafters, but each word wore gloves," "blue skittered." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during Ruan's questions, slightly pulled back for the entity's responses. Dialogue carries subtext: "Do you hear it wanting a mouth" and "My hunger is for the flat" reveal character through indirection. Minor register elevation in some metaphors ("vellum," "chiasmus") fits the priest-scholar voice but occasionally drifts toward ornament. Free indirect style is clean when the entity speaks through Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single first-person POV is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (filtering landscape through musical metaphor and nostalgic precision). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains voice-consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Compression is purposeful and taught early ("mirrored horizon that held the sky like a breath it refused to release"). Minor issue: a few sentences approach ornamental density without clear propulsion ("a duet across a single seam"), creating brief textural stall mid-climb, though rhythm recovers by the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person POV is stable and voice-particular: compressed syntax, dense metaphor ("rain had slowed to single notes, spaced like decisions I was afraid to play"), perceptual signature that notices light, weight, echoes. The piece teaches its lyric-compression pattern early and sustains it; elision is purposeful (we infer the procedural trials rather than watch each step). Slight register drift in the guard exchange ("what right I had to float past my sins" / "borrowed from a future that needed this corridor") reads more oracular than Lio's established idiom, but the effect is brief and the internal voice recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in tight third, filtered through Lena's tactile and vibrational perception. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("a courteous partner refusing to lead," "a tide reciting its coastline to the moon"). However, elevated metaphor density in high-pressure beats—"absence tug back," "enthrall by composing space around each beat"—risks abstraction that distances the reader from embodied experience. Filter constructions ("she imagined," "she felt") appear frequently without clear purpose, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as polished but occasionally substitutes figurative flourish for concrete sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The first-person voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature (storm metaphors, lateral observation, professional patience) and stays character-bound throughout. Dialogue with the follower is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext ("her voice was careful, unsuspicious"). The prose occasionally inflates into elevated register ("layered tranquility," "velvet motor") that reads slightly decorative rather than voice-motivated under peak pressure. Distance control is stable, and focalization remains consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic compression, metaphorical density, and a habit of recursive observation ("the rope remembers tension, and tension remembers time"). Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs ("I think," "I feel") are voice-motivated. Diction is consistently elevated yet grounded in concrete imagery ("sun-cracked," "salt to taste," "bright fatigue"). Brief dialogue from the escapee and the poet's response to the visitors is purposeful and advances plot. The prose modulates rhythmically under pressure (the grotto filling with hush, the rope shuddering) without losing coherence. No head-hopping; elision is taught and serves the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-textural register, with Mara's perceptual bias toward acoustic phenomena shaping what is noticed ("dripping eaves," "rhythm of leaks," "curved echoes"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("She draws her bow… She bows near the bridge… She hangs the bell") create a ritualistic cadence that serves the accumulative design. However, the voice occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("mendicant," "unbind," "magnificent simplicity") that, while coherent, edges past the POV's lived immediacy under peak pressure. No head-hopping; distance remains stable. Dialogue is minimal and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the dealer; perceptual signature is distinct (sensing via static, "fish hear riverbeds," "jeweler's loupe for invisible lies"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("courage is the child of fear and knowledge, and I sell adoption papers, never offspring"). Diction is controlled and idiosyncratic throughout, with purposeful compression ("phloxless book," "limestone consonants fusing with amber vowels"). Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("I felt her lab bench," "I felt the exact instant") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, though they remain voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV first person maintains consistent perceptual signature: nautical idiom ("making parentheses," "tide and moon"), occupational lens ("my ledger closed but my senses open"), distinct rhythm. Lena's indirect characterization through action and the broker's filtering keep distance stable. Late-paragraph reflection ("I thought of my uncle, the tuner, Lena...") compresses multiple beats without micro-choices, mildly diluting momentum. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person, intimate and lyric. Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist notices through craft metaphors (salt "cataloged," vows "breathe inside," bench as "lattice of anecdotes"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("porous than solitude," "grammar of staying"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: "Because my hands always build for others… I want to be woven in" advances plot and character. Minor slips: some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("braided halos," "luminescent ache," "silvering the air") borders on overwriting but remains legible and pattern-taught. No head-hopping; distance stays controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV control is clean with a distinct perceptual signature: the illustrator notices anatomy ("bones of timing and lungs of space"), natural history details (dead pigeons, ferns, limestone seashells), and craft mechanics. Diction remains character-consistent ("my sketchbook is braver than my hands," "curiosity nibbles through warnings like moss"). Some metaphors stretch plausibility in peak moments ("sound drops a seed there, sprouting a shimmer") but stay within lyric-voice range. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative certainty matches what the focalizer observes and infers.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric-precise diction ("theorem unfinished," "a line we can carry together"), compression taught early and sustained. POV distance is stable; the protagonist's perceptual signature prioritizes pattern and number without clinical coldness. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives during the tuning sequence, longer cadences at closure. Minor density: some lines ("ambiguous loss, the kind that leaves a chair…") edge toward authorial gloss rather than filtered perception, but the effect remains voice-motivated and does not break focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic sense memory ("Smell a reagent and know a chemist weeps"), architectural metaphors ("shy architecture," "oars laid down by some ancient, sleepy crew"), and lyric compression. Distance is controlled; the narrator's knowledge stays character-bound. Diction is purposefully elevated and poetic but remains consistent with the narrator's archival, caretaker voice. The single line of dialogue from Mara ("You found it") is natural and goal-driven. Brief elision (the narrator's exact identity) is purposeful and resolved at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "the wind had other syllables for me, and I was a poor translator" and "my honesty is awkward and circuitous" establish voice-particular diction. POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Theo's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: "whether the leaf was choosing routes toward survival or toward me" advances thematic pressure without exposition. Diction stays within the nursery owner's lexicon throughout, with rhythmic control modulating from controlled ("my ledger lined up like seed flats") to releasing ("I will keep listening"). One brief slip: "circuitously sincere" is used identically for both narrator and Theo, blurring voice distinction momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent perceptual signature: "I palmed it, a line of cold went up my wrist"; "my eyes burned with that haggard awe again." Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring causality. Mara's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: "Do not dress it up, painter" advances the exchange negotiation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during brooch discovery, widening slightly during mural work to accommodate community involvement. Minor filter-verb density in reflective beats ("I wanted to thresh," "I said I wanted nothing") slightly dulls immediacy but does not break pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "the song of the walls bows like a choir greeting a new frequency," "my question comes back like gulls returning, beaks bright with small reflections." Purposeful compression and patterned elision (e.g., "a soft subtraction where light should be") are taught early and charge the closure image. Free indirect style remains clean; psychic distance is stable. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext: "They say their name like a bell dipped in water" embodies rather than reports. Register is consistent and voice-motivated; no filter-verb stacks. Diction under pressure ("sweet and alarming," "the vowel deepen") supports rather than obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with ocean-spray idiom ("brine-laced ledgers," "windborne testimonies," "boats sigh, ropes sneeze") and rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during valve handling, reflective during testimony collection). Compression and patterned diction ("hearten," "staggered intervals," "navigated absences") are taught early and sustained. Some phrases edge toward elevated register ("reactively visionary," "accountable memory") that slightly exceeds the archivist's lived lexicon during peak moments, and syntactic parallelism ("I step, I pause, I step") occasionally tips into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct lyric register: "geometry of feelings laid onto street grids," "a compass needle that refused to pretend to be still." Psychic distance is close and consistent, and the narrator's perceptual signature (mapping, tracing angles, trusting cracks) is maintained throughout. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("trembling certainty," "the hush of breath," "consenting to be passed") that feels uniform across emotional peaks, reducing voice modulation under pressure. The prose leans heavily on metaphor in nearly every sentence, creating a patterned lushness that risks monotony rather than rhythmic variation. No dialogue is present; interior voice is coherent but could benefit from more syntactic variety to heighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyric voice is consistent and purposeful ("Wind wrote pale calligraphy," "I scoff politely"). Register remains elevated throughout, which fits the reflective narrator but occasionally drifts into self-conscious lyricism ("corridors of faint starlight where our steps left no dust, only chorded echoes") that abstracts rather than grounds high-pressure beats. No dialogue present; evaluation focuses on narrative voice. Perceptual signature is distinct (sympathetic skeptic filtering through metaphor), but peak moments like the tile flaring and corridors opening would gain immediacy from more embodied syntax. FOV stable, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "even boredom respects a fruit that knows its own falling" and "the familiar tin of an approaching double-cross." Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent with the immortal's voice; no head-hopping occurs. Mara's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: "My name is Mara, courier for the Archive, and your rumors read like maps in our vaults." Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately under pressure without register drift. Minor density in figurative language does not obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: diction ("as if the dead released a solvent," "drips from the faucet to keep the beat") reflects occupational filter and lyric compression. Psychic distance is stable; internal voice (father's axioms reframed through honesty) remains coherent under stress. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and subtextual: "Sir, I said, the hospital needs these by dawn, and what you are seeing is work, not a door anyone breaks" pursues a goal via misdirection. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric-meditative syntax, precise sensory selection ("apricots and sawdust," "gold that smells faintly of lemons"), and perceptual bias (charting minutes, refracting light) anchored in the stationer's archival attention. Psychic distance remains stable; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("a bell without a ringer, just orbiting hush") and patterned ellipsis are taught and legible. Minor diction slips into elevated register ("glissando," "scriptorium") appear but do not break voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is highly specific and stable: lyric-compressed syntax, maritime/archival diction ("diesel sheen," "hieroglyphs," "scribe rubbing away letters"), and a perceptual signature that translates containers into language. Psychic distance remains intimate first-person throughout with no head-hopping. The two brief dialogue moments ("the machines never listen") carry subtext and feel natural. Purposeful compression ("I do this by collecting fragments") is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor strain: "a murder that had learned to bathe" risks purple without clear payoff, but the line stays within the narrator's metaphor-dense idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with lyric compression and metaphoric density ("listening is the hinge on which honesty swings"). POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature—testing myths, noting footprints, avoiding altars—remains consistent. The prose modulates with emotional intensity: the apology beat shifts to direct address, and the closing lines open into imagistic cadence. Non-standard punctuation (comma splices, participial chains) is voice-motivated and legible. However, elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats ("trudging syllables," "transcript in vibrations," "reimagines past conversations without lying about them"), creating mild register drift that occasionally clashes with the intimate frame. Filter verbs ("I thought," "I felt," "I wanted") cluster in the middle third without harming immediacy but add mild opacity. No head-hopping occurs, and the elision of the kitchen memory until the compass returns is purposeful and paid off. The voice is singular but leans toward abstraction under stress rather than compression.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies braided together," "orderly intuitive," the chip as memory of weight. Diction is poetic but controlled, staying within a voice that blends bureaucratic practicality with lyric specificity. No head-hopping; the single POV is stable. Purposeful compression (e.g., "hopeful desperation had a smell") teaches a pattern that pays off in the final image. The two brief dialogue exchanges ("move east, slow drums, open hands" in the painting code; "it is not a finale, it is a pivot") feel goal-driven and voice-matched. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer under pressure, wider in the final reflective beat—and free indirect style remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: professional vocabulary ("crater inspector," "micro impacts," "ferric chloride meets ferrocyanide") mixed with lyric compression ("logos comb their antlers across the day"). POV modesty is maintained—inference reads as inference ("I think of the first crater"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close for the vial ritual, wider for the shepherd's memory. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the narrator notices meteors, formulas, wind directions, and the "briefest thunder of cloth and spring" from the shutter. Minor slip: "their silence makes the mountain larger than my breathing" edges toward elevated register but remains voice-plausible given the narrator's lyric bent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: sound, texture, echo, oil scent filter all observation. Jaro's brief narration ("bollards, ropes, men") is clearly mediated by Mara's request and does not leak interiority. Diction is elevated and patterned ("iron prayers," "magnetic calm," "syllables promising") in a way that reads purposeful but occasionally slips into poetic stock ("mist-coated," "breathed like a sleeping animal") without fresh specificity. Dialogue is minimal and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "dry-witted," reading condensation as prayer, framing the falcon as punctuation, imagining the atlas page from a singular pupil outward. POV distance is stable (close third); diction is controlled, specific, and voice-motivated ("the door complains at being used, then falls quiet, as if embarrassed"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("Sources whisper more than mouths do, and maps mishear them") are taught early and serve lyric accumulation. Rhythm modulates with intensity—short declaratives at the crossing, longer reflection at discovery. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The prose reflects the mind of a cartographer under cold and wonder without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person; the narrator's perceptual signature favors poetic compression ("shadow that expects the moon," "alleys like dry riverbeds"). However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ordinary courage of returning home," "pattern of charged callbacks") that feels more essayistic than embodied perception. Distance control is consistent, though the narrator's interior remains underdeveloped—more witness than participant. The tuner's sparse dialogue ("names carry only one mouth, but rhythm carries a square") is voice-distinct but borders on aphorism. No head-hopping; compression is purposeful and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—technical details (gauges, fins, oxygen) filter through lyric compression ("thin metallic syllables," "hawk tightening its claws on its own legs"). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Small strain: under peak physical stress (net entanglement, low oxygen) the diction occasionally elevates into metaphoric density ("marionette," "scalloped pillars," "filigree of netting that time had gilded") that feels slightly over-calibrated for crisis cognition, though it remains voice-consistent and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person narration maintains stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "clockwork salt," "knees" smell in the lattice). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains internally coherent; no register drift into anachronism. The narrator's way of noticing (scuffs as hieroglyphs, foam as instructions) is selective and character-specific. However, sustained figurative density in nearly every line ("sea rehearsed storms," "gull hover like commas") risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff; the high metaphor load in the climax ("the hush bent") remains legible but presses the limit.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric diction ("ashen-veil," "venomous," "tuning stringed flasks"), syntactic variety, and POV-specific perception (the bead "a heart calling them to wake"). The ghost bride's speech carries subtext and distinct idiom ("you would drown a seed to teach it patience"). Compression is purposeful and taught early; the reader learns the pattern of alchemical metaphor and ephemeral appearances. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature remains stable under pressure. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (intimate interiority, then wider reflection in the closing lines).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices through the wharf-weaver's idiom (sew, thread, stitch, nets) and reads the labyrinth as "not a puzzle but a choir." Diction stays consistently lyric and image-dense ("cool palm on my brow as if blessing a fever," "orchid solace unfolding across stone") without unmotivated register shifts. No dialogue appears. Under peak pressure (sewing the seam open, pressing the plate), the syntax compresses slightly but the interior texture holds, and the final council exchange ("what rules I followed") remains in the narrator's voice without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with a lyric, meditative voice that fits the reflective diaspora returnee. Perceptual signature is evident in the figurative texture ("questions like water carried light," "bones looked less like endings and more like rested luggage"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated, workshop-register phrasing ("Resonant Reconfiguration" is not in the text, but "belief arrived in mixed tenses" and "compass of stains that refused to fade" push toward abstraction). No dialogue is present to judge naturalism or subtext. Free indirect style is clean, tense is consistent, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. Minor penalty for slight over-reliance on metaphor density in peak beats, which risks obscuring immediacy, though voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is consistent and distinct: noticing margins, arrows, color codes, and the "white space" that others ignore. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with lyric compression ("mouth full of coins," "night lake") that remains legible and voice-motivated. The piece uses contemplative pacing and free indirect reflection without filter-verb stacks. Mira's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("threading night into cloth as if mending weather"), purposeful syntax that mirrors Tamsin's accretive method, and perceptual signature (she notices hesitations, pauses, sugar-traced lines). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The single-POV interiority stays anchored in present stimuli (flame flicker, cloth lifted to dome) and micro-choices (breathing on glass, stitching the moon). Dialogue with Rauk is sparse but purposeful: her "crooked jokes" serve subtext (disguising wisdom as foolishness). Diction matches a literate, slightly archaic register appropriate to an observatory embroiderer. Minor: some phrasing ("the language of missing names," "echo became assent") leans toward elevated abstraction that occasionally obscures immediacy, though the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-incantatory register with purposeful repetition ("I am here to find the moment before deciding"). However, some lines drift into elevated diction that feels imposed rather than voice-rooted: "evoke it, and I do, calling up my hunger" reads more prompt-echo than character thought. The medium's dialogue ("tomorrow is not the moment before deciding") carries subtext but occasionally tips into aphorism. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (tide, roots, moon as structuring images) is consistent, though a few filter verbs ("I feel the ache in him") dull immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person-limited POV with stable psychic distance; the translator's perceptual signature is consistent (conflict-zone professional, attuned to "tremors of borders and to lullabies") and filters all detail through mediation instincts. Diction is elevated and lyric but remains coherent: "lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent," "tide-pool" breathing, "unknot" as both literal and metaphoric act. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("I translate," "I unknot," "I carry") anchor beats without template cadence. No head-hopping; the families' interiority is inferred through gesture and speech, not accessed. Minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" and "lotus-hearted" border on ornamental when first introduced, though both are later dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters sensory input through artist idiom ("fog for a canvas and branches for rafters," "brushstroke here, a kiss there") and whimsical concreteness ("purse of spare dawns," "baited the roots with stories and marmalade"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure ("I laughed, and it sounded like a gate discovering it still swings"). Non-standard syntax and rhythmic compression are purposeful and legible. Minor: some figurative density in mid-passage approaches overwriting ("shawl…knitted from shrugged shoulders and sudden giggles"), and a few recycled stems ("I wanted," "I knew," "I had") create mild template cadence, but rhythm modulates across beats and the voice stays singular.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyric-philosophical, consistent and controlled: "patience is a door you open with sound" and "each petal another room where someone wakes" carry syntactic signature. POV is stable first-person, no head-hopping. Diction occasionally tips elevated ("begets," "bewitch," "graphite rain") but remains coherent under the restorer's sensibility. Perceptual signature is strong (sound-tuned observation). The piece teaches its pattern early; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person plural holds stable collective focalization; no head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Diction carries consistent lyric compression ("air turned cashier," "ribs like slatted sunlight") and perceptual signature (noticing beetles, pollen, irrigation commas). However, elevated register ("candidly cryptic," "depreciate regret") sometimes drifts above the concrete texture the voice elsewhere inhabits, and Ilya's dialogue ("We will annotate this with stems") reads more as thesis than spoken idiom. Purposeful compression is taught early and remains legible at closure; no filter-stack penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person singular throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "drink the dark and exhale petals," "crooked as a crab path," "shyly unstoppable as a sprout cracking stone." Diction remains character-particular and lyric without slipping into generic register. The blossoms' voices are differentiated by rhythm (red "coughs," white "whispers," thorn "rattles"), though convergence at closure is acceptable given the armistice frame. Purposeful compression and ellipsis (the journey down the stairs, the gathering of old gardeners) are taught early and maintained; the reader learns to expect summary of transit. Minor friction: in peak beats, elevated diction occasionally strains the voice—"ensconce the galaxy postcard in the pocket above my heart" reads slightly formal for a narrator otherwise rooted in embodied metaphor. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The piece teaches its lyric mode and holds it without line-level voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV third-person close with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the caretaker notices syllables cupped in petals, consonants leaning on one another, bookends waddling. Diction is lyric and purposefully compressed ("harp-bright and salt-tender," "foghorn cotton"), taught as the piece's pattern. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction without clear POV anchor ("deserted marvels returned as murmurs," "neighborhoods of sound where warmth would not evaporate"), and some metaphors push legibility ("ferris wheel nobody rode" as a murmur feels ornamental). No head-hopping; narrative stance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyric—figurative diction ("choir of hush," "scholarship of retreat") anchored in the narrator's academic idiom. POV remains stable first-person with clean temporal control. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("You forgot this," "You came back"), carrying subtext and goal pursuit without over-articulation. However, figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("metronome on our impatience," "corridor ahead looked less like a fork and more like a chorus"), occasionally slowing momentum and creating mild register drift. Filter verbs ("I remembered," "I imagined") appear but fit the reflective mode. Free indirect for Mara is minimal; her interiority remains opaque, reinforcing single-POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person voice is distinct, filtering setting through the engineer's attentive, metaphor-rich perception ("dark ribs of basalt," "stone lung," "dappled resolve"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature—observing breath, trembling, translating pattern into compassion—remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue (council and farmer exchanges) is brief but goal-driven and purposeful, advancing the test and resolution. Free indirect style is clean. The prose modulates appropriately: lyric during discovery, more grounded during the demonstration. Minor caution: some elevated diction ("fossilized waves," "cathedral") approaches overwriting but stays voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: poetic compression ("blooming withering," "sympathy, the ache of a note seeking its echo") remains controlled and legible throughout. POV is stable; perceptual signature is character-specific (navigation by dust motes, trust as fugitive, ledger margins as charts). Diction stays within the narrator's register—no sudden academic intrusions. Purposeful compression in lines like "She vanished into a calendar square" and "trust cracked like shell" serve emotional precision without obscuring causality. The final paragraph's rhythm modulates to closure cadence without losing texture. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I tell," "I learned") are acceptable here as voice-motivated anchors rather than dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV first-person voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("featherly determined," "green forgetfulness"), metaphor density (wood grain as river, vortex rings, compass roses), and perceptual filter (architect's child reading codes in textures). Psychic distance is stable; interiority is concrete ("stubborn with love," pulse steadying). The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the frame crossing, longer syntactic arcs during reflection. Minor density concern: figurative language appears in most sentences, approaching saturation, but the pattern is taught early (prism, fractured hush) and the voice remains coherent. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person; the astrologer's perceptual signature (coastlines courting starlight, phonemes of water) is consistent and profession-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Mara's lines ("the city was not dead, only patient") carry subtext and advance the ritual. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("shadowseam wonder," "the simple secret I had crossed tides to find") that tests the line between lyric voice and overwrought diction. Psychic distance is controlled, though some turns ("It was enough to captivate my doubt, folding it into the glow") rely on telling rather than embodied perception. Under peak stress (generator hesitation), compression tightens appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: "light grins sadly," "foam forgets," "cobweb math." Diction is consistently lyric and metaphor-dense, voice-motivated and legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but do not flatten immediacy. No dialogue present. Distance is stable. However, the heightened register risks alienating clarity under pressure; some readers may find the figurative density excessive in peak beats without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds consistently through the performer's perceptual signature: analytical, measuring, spatially precise. Diction ("tuples of strangers," "microcurrents," "drafting new lanes") reflects his mindset. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats ("orchestrated serendipity, a fragile theater of inevitabilities"), creating distance rather than immediacy. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext ("Do you play"). The woman's brief interior guess ("a day of spreadsheets or schedules") is plausible inference but leans toward helpful narrator. No head-hopping, and the final image stays anchored in his gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: "Each heel falls exactly where his gaze is not" and "arranging lines between the dates printed on his orders" reflect a dancer's spatial-temporal awareness. Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. The lyric register is voice-motivated and consistent, though occasionally the diction climbs into elevated metaphor that strains against the immediacy of the moment—"a harbor no law can close" and "a lighthouse deciding to wander" both beautiful but slightly abstracted from scene pressure. Dialogue is brief and effective: the watcher's question "if forgetting can be gentle" lands with subtext and advances the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable single-perspective throughout; perceptual signature is craft-specific and consistent—"grammar the mouth forgets while the eyes remember," "reads between lines most people call seams." Diction stays character-particular: "putty than petitions," "concentricities intersect," "seam where breakage learns to belong." The glazier's sparse dialogue contrasts with the master's bureaucratic concerns, and the silence itself ("I said nothing, only tipped the fractured sun") carries subtext and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. Minor: a few phrases verge on elevated register ("noctilucent reckonings," "translating wind, worry, and chance") but remain voice-motivated by the glazier's meditative, artisan idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the firefighter; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the box-opening, slightly wider for the descent). Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("doubt braided into his quiet stride," "flame lifted the roof like a closing fist"), though some constructions—"a hard softness that wanted to be learned," "gently skilled at moving weight without breaking it"—drift toward elevated abstraction that feels imposed rather than inhabited. Mira's brief dialogue is functional but not distinctly voiced. The prose texture is purposeful and poetic, but repetitive syntactic stems ("He carried," "He would," "He felt") and filter verbs ("he could not answer," "he wanted to") slightly flatten immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries distinct texture—"logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful," "serene upheaval"—with vocabulary scaled to the protagonist's experimental idiom (buoyancy, coefficient, conjecture, algorithm). Perceptual signature is selective: the protagonist notices pattern, resonance, and lift where others might see decoration or coincidence. Diction modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter clauses when the needle rises ("shy but certain"), longer when the protagonist reflects on proof. No dialogue appears on the page, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Free indirect style is clean, and filter verbs ("I believed," "I realized") are voice-motivated and infrequent. One minor slip: "serene upheaval arrived like a tide" borders on external omniscience rather than lived perception, but recovers quickly in the next beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices sound topology, reverberation blueprints, and emotional textures in architecture. Diction is purposefully lyric ("exhaling a corridor that should not have existed," "tiles swung from flood journals to rehearsals") and remains voice-consistent under pressure. Free indirect reflection anchors in present stimuli (the film strip, the fireplace) and tilts present stance via micro-choices (placing the strip against the mantel, whispering the man's name). No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates intentionally. Rhythm control is strong: longer sentences during discovery, shorter when the narrator acts to release the haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric—"swallows spooled their quiet," "coded lullabies in children's songs"—with consistent compression and patterned diction. POV remains stable third-limited on the painter. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("I am here…to persuade mirrors"). However, perceptual signature is generalized rather than character-specific; the painter's "odd appetite" and "dusky harmony" are asserted labels. Under peak pressure (the ritual itself), diction remains elevated and uniform rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the negotiator's trained attention to "adjust a distance," the vocabulary of vows and ledgers, and the self-aware admission of shelved truths. Diction is elevated and consistent ("operatively gentle," "muster," "ledger," "seam," "hinge") but occasionally slips into abstract register ("ritual significance," "thread our intentions into the world's quieter memory") that risks workshop-speak. Dialogue is absent; all speech is indirect summary ("The General wants guarantees and the Matriarch wants grace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the ambush confession. Minor deduction: some stems recur ("I ask," "I set," "I tell") in the middle third, creating mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices market logic ("priced it handsomely"), sentimental detail ("cradle warm, careful as contrition"), and technical process (ion nets, aquifer pulses) in character-specific ways. Diction remains controlled under pressure: "the shell answered with a pinprick star" and "a thin astonished note, not quite a word" show rhythmic modulation without register drift. One minor slip: "syllables I had bought with money and grief" edges toward elevated summary where a concrete gesture might have landed harder. The recurring self-aware parenthetical ("No one knows this about me, how secretly sentimental I am") maintains voice consistency but risks over-articulation. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira with a lyric, elevated register that matches the ritual frame. Perceptual signature is present: "bodily poetic" steps, breath as metronome, ribbons knotted with pale breath. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, though occasionally slides into abstraction ("the hush grew bright," "the city's great braid") that reads more thematic than immediate. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean. The prose maintains its texture under pressure, but the elevated register risks distancing the reader from Lira's felt experience at peak moments—more ceremony than sweat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Aurel notices "pencil scratches," "half-lit epiphanies," "hive of second thoughts." Diction remains elevated but coherent throughout, appropriate to an "urbane calligrapher." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Aurel's apology is "without poetry," and Ferro's line to the moth carries subtext and deflects tension. The prose modulates naturally from introspective density in the dome to sharper beats in the bar without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is singular and sustained: diction ("blushing stillness," "grammar of winds," "petal burning") is purposeful, poetic, and character-particular. POV is stable first-person; psychic distance remains intimate throughout. Perceptual signature is strong—attention to wind, wing-beats, cardinal axes, and the distinction between capture and accompaniment. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("flame ceding itself to distance," "clouds swam below like slow fish") risks ornamentation, but the patterns are taught early and the final lines remain clear. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV stability throughout. Diction—"technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor," "ledger I had studied in childhood and betrayed by absence"—is voice-particular and purposeful. Perceptual signature filters setting through craft idiom (lost wax, bronze, molds, wax tongues). Under peak stress, compression remains controlled ("The organ inhaled, the ropes held, and the room opened like a lung"). No head-hopping; focalization is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "arithmetic of snail trails," "choir of fog," "cicada shell." POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tighter during seal-breaking, wider during collective turn). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the shorter ache of Only," "laughter steadied my hands"). Rhythmic compression during peak pressure (lattice dissolving, room shaking) stays legible. One minor register drift: "transcend" and "parameters" edge toward elevated diction in a narrator otherwise grounded in embodied metaphor, though the effect remains within plausible lexicon for a philosophical seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; the narrative distance modulates with the astronomer's heightened attention during the ritual without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and period-appropriate ("patient dust," "eventless spaces where meaning collects"), filtering the palace through the astronomer's scholarly, frugal perceptual signature. The astronomer's lexicon of "ratios and paths," "schematic representations," and "grammar of stone" feels character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, though at peak moments the prose occasionally drifts toward decorative phrasing ("the mosaics around him unclasped their scenes") that slightly distances the reader from immediacy. No dialogue appears; all pressure operates through gesture and interior resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV first-person with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature—"scheming pacifist with pockets full of methods and heartaches" establishes voice. Diction remains character-particular through metaphor ("eyes bright with the kindled stiffness," "breathed as if pulling her lungs through nettles"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Mara's lines pursuing resistance then yielding. Deduction for occasional elevated register that stretches plausibility ("inward hymn," "limned a discipline") and some filter-verb reliance ("I saw in the swirls") that could be tighter, though overall voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Iren; focalization is controlled and the perceptual signature is clear (craftsman's attention to geometry, breath, and reflection). Diction is elevated and lyric ("the way fruit remembers seeds," "the air polished itself to a bell") but stays consistent and voice-motivated. However, the prose leans heavily on metaphoric register throughout, and under peak pressure the syntax does not meaningfully compress or modulate—rhythm remains uniform. Free indirect thought is clean, but no dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The lack of sentence-level rhythm variation and the unrelieved figurative density prevent entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctive and compression is purposeful: "which is just a committee of need," "listening mends louder than any tool." The mender's perceptual signature filters everything through craft and loss—water "giggles," repairs "confess," promises "get heavy on tiny backs." Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally between repair instruction and memory. Dialogue from the kids is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext about trust and vows. The purposeful aphoristic turns ("my mistakes, which is a school that never expels anyone") are voice-consistent and earned by the repair context rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the curator notices through museum-logic ("catalog," "inventory," "ledger") and philosophical whimsy ("simply complicated," "tender mathematics"). Diction is controlled and lyric, purposefully compressed in places ("brightened disquiet," "rain on a summer drought"). The bathroom-breakthrough motif is idiosyncratic and voice-consistent. One minor slip: "which seemed both page and soil" leans slightly expository in a high-density paragraph, but the effect supports the surreal setting without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinctive perceptual signature: "petal grammar," "storyblood," "negative space, a score of rests." Diction stays character-specific (arcane linguist filtering through botanical and musical metaphor) and modulates under pressure—compressed syntax when the wall shivers, then expands for the final reflection. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at peak beats. Minor slip: a few lines approach therapeutic self-awareness ("a catalogue of carefulness that kept me safe and smaller than purpose") that reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority, though it remains within the established voice's reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and tightly controlled: "wrong the way survival is right," "a parliament of me," "tipping seeds into our pockets." POV remains stable; first-person singular expands to include the materialized twin without head-hopping, reading as internal plurality made external. Diction is character-particular and consistent under pressure. The perceptual signature—attention to thresholds, color, and names—threads throughout. The occasional elevated register ("parliament," "constellation," "horticultural") fits the narrator's archival, naming work. Minor filter-verb density in the funhouse sequence ("I spoke," "I told," "I needed") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: the archivist's perceptual signature filters everything through archive patience and methodical warmth ("I read patterns as if they are weather for the mind," "coaxing a shy truth to the table and feeding it soup"). Distance remains stable in intimate first-person; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("They copied futures into past ledgers, and dates became neighbors that skipped greetings") and metaphor density are pattern-taught early and sustained. Minor slip: near the end, "Because I am an adaptable archivist, my devotion is not to dust, but to clear complexity that people can live in" edges toward thematic statement rather than dramatized stance, slightly reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is highly distinctive: "clamor folded upon clamor, a pressure you taste," "like script that refuses ink," "the bloom of hush is not silence; it is a contour." Perceptual signature (reading by crack patterns, tasting metal and snow, hearing ceilings answer "like iron remembering fire") remains consistent and character-specific throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during stone-handling beats, slightly wider during reflective passages on first charts and past mistakes. The prose texture reflects the focalizer's professional idiom (ripple-mark, calcite ribs, tuned darkness) without register drift. One brief slip: "bringing memory in from the cold" edges toward poetic ornament that slightly loosens the tactile grip, but recovers immediately in the next beat's concrete action (tracing on leather with bone needle).

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Kera notices trembling panes, apprentice voices in the wind, and old calibrations as syllables. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("a patient conspiracy," "a dance of lenses found its perfect breath"). No head-hopping; single POV held cleanly. Psychic distance modulates intentionally when retrocognition pulls her backward. Minor ding: some figurative constructions in the opening third ("thin music over ruins and salt," "retroactively blessed, cursed, some said") edge toward elevated register, but the prose remains legible and voice-motivated throughout pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV with stable first-person; no head-hopping. The voice is distinct—elevated, lyric, precise—but the register remains uniformly poetic even under conjecture-testing pressure, where urgency might modulate diction. Perceptual signature is consistent (the archivist notices shadows, breath, alignments) and the lexicon fits the role. Filter verbs ("I feel," "I understand") appear but are voice-motivated. The prose reads as a singular artistic stance, though the lack of syntactic compression or heightened rhythm at peak beats (the glass-speaking moment) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited focalization through Lio is mostly stable, with perceptual filters ("serious playfulness," chanting as metronome) establishing voice. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("tesserae," "articulation," "ambient awareness") that reads more authorial than character-bound, especially under pressure. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("silence had grown too loud here") with modest subtext. Figurative density is high and occasionally stacks without clear POV motivation ("gravity of hopelessness," "patient stones"), flattening the narrator's perceptual signature during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a richly idiosyncratic perceptual signature: "warmly observant sorter of gleams, slow grazers, and respiring sand." Diction is elevated but consistent with a literate chronicler's lens, and purposeful compression ("the pause ended, its salt on our tongues") serves the lyric design. The partner's voice appears in indirect summary ("You said that patience was not waiting but allowing a shore to arrive"), maintaining focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment (hand on cicada) to wider reflection (notebooks, first learning), always anchored to present stimuli. Minor penalty for one filter-verb stack in mid-section ("I felt," "I thought," "I remembered") that slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices silences as flavors, tastes quiet "as carefully as tea leaves," and translates sensory experience through a gardener's lexicon ("train my listening the way gardeners train vines"). Psychic distance is stable; filter verbs ("I realize") appear but fit the reflective voice. Diction stays character-bound except for occasional elevated turns ("intangibly tangible," "xenial") that read slightly imported but remain legible. The shared sip with the passing collector demonstrates purposeful psychic modulation. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong ("I taste the bunker and I do not break"), though some mid-scene sentences drift toward list-like parallelism.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: "the hush is not empty here; it springs, arches, a vaulting hush." Perceptual signature is consistent (monitoring instruments, catenary wires, signal beacons). Distance remains stable in first-person present. The dialogue ("his name") is purposefully minimal, allowing silence to carry subtext. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the operator's working idiom—"yawed its facets," "facet" as terrace descriptor—without clear voice motivation, and a few lines ("the noisy parts of us know they can set down their aches") slip into aphorism that feels authored rather than operator-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "colors tasted like childhood circuitry," "knees learned again how to bow," "dawn answered." Diction and rhythm reflect Maris's lore-keeper lens, blending archaic phrasing ("made my sally") with speculative texture. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, peak-pressure moments (the final climb, palm placement) compress into summary rather than embodied micro-choices, softening immediacy. The drone dialogue ("I told it to hush") and orchard's clipped syllables work as voice-motivated deviation. Psychic distance is controlled, and the vocabulary stays within the narrator's plausible lexicon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is distinct and consistent, deploying lyric compression and metaphor throughout ("shame suffocates, slow, polite, and relentless"). POV remains stable in first person, and the Keeper's perceptual signature—prioritizing breath, scars, and spatial thresholds—reads character-specific. However, elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats without clear narrative justification: "encroach," "hinge," "cadence of surf that has forgotten the sea" cluster densely in the teaching sequence, drifting into a uniform lyric register that obscures immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Show me how to breathe") but lacks subtext or goal-driven friction. Free indirect thought is clean, yet the prose never modulates rhythm under peak stress, maintaining a single stately tempo that flattens pressure differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinctive—lyric compression, neologism ("shadowseam wonder"), metaphoric density—but the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the slow grammar of pressure," "a sentence I was becoming") that strains the focalizer's plausible idiom under crisis. POV remains stable first-person; psychic distance contracts appropriately in the chamber. The parallel-dimension texts introduce mild head-hopping risk (other selves' voices "with different bruises"), but they function as externalized interiority rather than true multi-POV. Diction is purposeful but dense enough that peak beats ("I felt ideas cool into weight around my ribs") sacrifice immediacy for texture.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is stable, lyric, and purposefully elevated with a consistent perceptual signature (metaphors drawn from architecture, music, and governance: "noose," "bridge of intuition," "standing waves," "thin horizon"). POV distance is controlled; the narrator's knowledge unfolds causally. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction that flattens immediacy: "nostalgia of shells people use instead of hearts" and "invisible ribs that pressed the room into confession" feel more decorative than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, and the compression of the discovery sequence is purposeful and legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent (metaphors drawn from armor, allegiance, performance). Diction remains elevated but stable; however, register drifts into abstract poeticism under pressure ("reality shifts," "meaning" brightening, "votes for the living present") where concrete embodiment would sharpen voice. The narrative certainty about orchard mechanics (what the pears "ask," what the doorway "opens onto") occasionally exceeds what the knight can plausibly infer, reducing POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and stable: archival diction ("emancipation," "legitimate privacy and negligent time") blends with lyric specificity ("dust patterns," "small, stubborn star"). Psychic distance is consistent; the narrator's perceptual signature (reading through gaps, shadows, hesitations) shapes every beat. No head-hopping. Minor texture issue: some lines edge toward elevated register ("the air itself is a ledger") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally drift from immediacy. Free indirect style is clean; the narrator's uncertainty at closure (sending "will be received") maintains stance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Jessa with a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature (coded freedom, auric glow, "puddle reflections at dusk"). Diction is elevated and patterned—"advertisements peeled like molting snakes," "starlight dripped through grates"—which suits the Accumulative mode. However, the contact's dialogue ("I am in the culvert beyond the lagoon, where the revision squads are cutting us from the records") reads expository rather than urgent, and the final paragraph's meta-reflection ("you do not repair the pattern; you teach the threads a new way to touch") shifts toward authorial stance, loosening distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV with a stable, poetic register: "I came before dawn, a morning fog saxophonist with breath borrowed from sleeping reeds." Perceptual signature is musician-specific (keys as moon scales, pads as eyelids, playing through negative space). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in peak beats ("the code licks my ears"), wider in reflective passages. Diction remains within the narrator's lyric-technical lexicon; no head-hopping. The extended poetic compression is taught early and sustained, with heightened figurative density that serves atmospheric pressure rather than obscuring causality. Occasional filter verbs ("I feel the vested hush settle") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register; perceptual signature is poetic and distanced ("whispering tremor," "braided in one wind"). Psychic distance remains elevated throughout, which mutes urgency at peak beats. Diction is purposefully archaic and compressed ("thistlefall," "scorched lichen and nectar"), fitting the fable-like tone, but the elevated register flattens emotional variation—calm assembly and climactic release share identical syntactic texture. No dialogue; internal voice is coherent but lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable first-person past with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is watchmaker-specific: "screws and springs," "tested each step with a watchmaker's patience," "thin blades for shims." Diction modulates under pressure—short phrases when climbing the ribs, longer syntactic breath when fear thins. The idiom "Fire unmade that certainty" and "I let the wheel turn me until my breathing matched the waterfall" carry voice-specific metaphor rooted in mechanical and temporal lexicons. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I realized," "I understood") are strategic and voice-motivated. Minor slip: "uncertainly certain poise" in the compass description borders on thesis statement rather than embedded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistently metalworker-particular with embodied diction ("silted ash," "slag-light," "filings") and a lyric cadence that modulates with emotional intensity. POV distance is stable; interiority stays within the alchemist's sensory and professional lexicon. Purposeful compression ("factually mystical as the tide tables we consult") teaches a pattern of oxymoron that pays off at closure. Minor penalty: a few lines ("luminous regret that burns without consuming me") edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the established voice under peak pressure, though recovery is swift.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "the river forgot its roar," "memories poured like coarse light," "fear has its manners when the sun is still negotiating dawn." Psychic distance is stable; all knowledge remains character-bound. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during pursuit ("I pursued it by detuning further"), longer cadences at resolution. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices sound, resonance, and light as a collector would. One minor slip: "oxygen and sorrow can share a chair" leans slightly abstract but recovers in the next beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "ultraviolet penance," "archive I trust, because it never stops to polish its entries," "equations are the only prayers I was taught to trust." Perceptual signature (proprioceptive distances, shiver writing dates on bones) remains consistent under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during trauma responses, further during theorem work). No head-hopping; elision of interrogation details is purposeful and paid off through trauma-response beats. Single minor slip: "displaced rooted" phrase feels slightly imposed rather than organic to the narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "oxidized hooks," "bruised whites begin to breathe," "silvery marginal weather." POV distance is stable, filter verbs are voice-motivated ("I think of my own childhood's roofline"), and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction slips into elevated register at peak beats ("elusively tangible," "petitioners to dawn," "cartographers of smell") that feel more ornamental than character-specific under pressure. The elder's brief speech carries subtext, but the narrator's internal voice converges with the prose texture throughout, reducing contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "Dust is honest; it rests where air forgets to argue." POV remains stable (single first-person). Diction is consistent, mixing occupational precision ("shafts and cables," "tooth of the barrel") with lyric compression ("a smile that practiced too long"). Perceptual signature is clear: the narrator notices structure, load, silence. Minor slips: some metaphors stretch ("the room became a held breath I could walk through"), and a few lines edge toward over-writing ("invoices forgiven"). Dialogue from the ghosts is minimal and serves function, though the watchmaker's exposition is slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually signature: "Type is not letters here but intervals between breath," "a choreography of pauses that attracts meaning the way glass attracts light." POV remains stable in first person, psychic distance controlled, with purposeful compression taught early and held. Diction stays within the operator's craft-metaphor lexicon throughout, and free indirect style is clean when the Glasswright's reflection flickers. Rhythmic modulation under pressure is evident in the press-bite sequence's longer cadences contrasted with the final paragraph's short declaratives. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the experimental mode pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistently poetic and architecturally dense, with a distinct perceptual signature: "time strings itself like harp wires," "visible seconds settle, like fish in a clear bowl." Diction remains within Neris's plausible lexicon—elevated, museum-custodian register—though the compression occasionally risks opacity ("folding it into patterns like brocade"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The rhythmic control under pressure is strong: the storm sequence accelerates syntax ("the storm strikes, making the window seconds bang like shutters"), then breathes into the resolution. Minor elision (the precise mechanics of the "calibration" Neris devises) is taught early via "a rhythm of breath matched to the storm" and paid off when the group dims lamps and covers mirrors, so no withholding penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the repairman notices sound as filament, names tools for courage, and reads smiles as lies. Diction remains consistently elevated and metaphor-dense, voice-motivated by the protagonist's synesthetic craft. However, register stays uniform across pressure peaks—confronting the constable and unwinding the drum receive identical lyric treatment, flattening urgency gradients. No dialogue on the page to test differentiation. Free indirect style is clean, though participle openers ("He asked," "He lifted," "He wound") create template cadence in the middle third. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose carries a distinct lyric-collector idiom ("sensibly eccentric," "skin of earth speaking itself," "hush gathering mass") with purposeful compression and patterned elevation. However, diction remains uniformly elevated even in peak tactile moments (pressing the needle, wading), where grounding specificity would sharpen immediacy. No dialogue; internal voice is stable and character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    First-person POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms out for reverie, in for tactile detail). Diction is lyric and distinct ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances," "weatherproof"), matching a poetic sculptor's perceptual signature. No dialogue to judge. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with urgent survival context: "through layered meanings only patience sorts" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" read more like craft-essay phrasing than embodied thought under storm pressure. The final long expository paragraph shifts into didactic mode ("No one needs a lecture when the sea is memory") that, while voice-consistent, flattens urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person; distance and focalization remain controlled throughout. Voice is lyric and contemplative with a distinct perceptual signature: "winter's last snow thinned into lace," "umbral tenderness that gentled the stone," "moon lifted her shoulder." Diction elevates consistently without register clash; the narrator's lexicon fits an artist attuned to light and form. Psychic distance widens during reflection and tightens during observation, supporting the accumulative design. One minor slip: "I reckoned this was love" in the penultimate paragraph tilts toward authorial summary rather than dramatized realization. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not applicable. The prose rhythm matches emotional intensity: longer, layered sentences during contemplation; shorter beats at the pavilion and closing walk.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct archival voice ("solemn," "dry glue," "unfinished sentences") and perceptual signature filtering setting through document-handling metaphors. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with compression like "gathered the first stars, each a pinprick confession" and "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes held night even at noon" maintaining lyric coherence. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into essayistic abstraction—"righteousness without listening becomes another uniform" and "truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move"—that reads more like thematic summarizing than lived thought under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: the alchemist notices "invisible streets sketch themselves," "lantern strings" loop in his head, "confetti that clogged gutters." Diction stays controlled ("deserted alchemist," "wedge of wrack," "arbors should climb") with purposeful elevated register that matches the conceptual stakes. The brief dialogue ("Tomorrow, we wake the ovens...") integrates cleanly as civic pedagogy rather than conversation. Minor rhythmic uniformity in mid-section beats (several "He [verb]" stems) slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and maintained: arcane diction ("venerable," "bruised by memory," "willow ink") fits an oath scribe who speaks dead languages. Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (sound as texture, memory as taste, oaths as weather) is consistent and character-specific. Minor: a few constructions edge toward over-ornamentation ("velvet disquiet presses over the garden, as if the air puts on mourning gloves"), slightly slowing momentum in the middle third without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: botanical precision ("husk," "lambent readiness"), inherited idiom ("all salt and root-cellar"), and synesthetic attention ("air clears its throat"). Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure: "furiously tranquil," "live ember," "commas inviting continuation." Brief elision (grandmother's full teaching) is purposeful and paid off through the unlock sequence. One friction: "I must coax the frozen order into sharper calm" and similar phrases occasionally drift toward elevated abstraction that brushes against but does not break the narrator's plausible register.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices tension, grainy hum, rime powder, and pressure ticks—sensory detail filtered through professional expertise. Diction remains stable ("credibly curious," "a tired animal choosing another path") with purposeful elevation that matches the contemplative setting. The piece sustains a lyric register without drift; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: "the zero hour meant something else" and "I was paid to throw the switch" edge toward expository scaffolding, though they serve voice-motivated reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "cosmic janitor," "apologize to the wind for all this metal," "a bruise that remembers healing." The narrator's way of noticing is spiritually inflected yet grounded in tactile ritual. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate interiority, then outward focus during the crew scene). The prose rhythm supports pressure: longer, meditative sentences in solitude compress slightly during the meteor surge without losing the contemplative texture. Filter verbs ("I see," "I said") fit the reflective mode. No head-hopping; the crew's interior shift is inferred through external cues (clipboards hung loose, foreman forgets deadline).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV held throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices "the hush between sounds," traces "scorch patterns like signatures," reads currents. Diction is elevated and lyric ("mute eloquence," "pliant weight," "viscous archive") but stable and voice-motivated, matching her contemplative stance. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and parallelism ("Through contextual clues" recurs three times) teach a pattern that pays off at closure. Under peak pressure (opening the box, tracing the ellipse) syntax compresses without losing Mara's internal texture. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor: some figurative density approaches the Q7 threshold but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice sustains a lyric, second-person-adjacent register ("minutes taste like copper," "ribs answered with a hopeful ache") without mid-paragraph drift. Diction remains character-particular: the narrator perceives through textures and avoided arithmetic, and no therapy-speak intrudes. Purposeful compression ("I wanted more than survival; I wanted to understand") and patterned syntactic parallelism ("we did not count success; we touched it") are taught early and paid off at closure. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated ("I felt the borrowed heartbeats") and do not stack densely enough to trigger penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable first-person singular with consistent perceptual signature: the poet notices ripples "that do not know whether it is sky returning or water staying" and hears gulls practicing "arguments that only wind understands." Diction stays within the narrator's lyric register throughout, with purposeful compression ("the gust twists strange," "sound blanks") that remains legible. Dialogue is minimal but effective: "You can work with this, I tell him, by harmonizing discord until the crooked comes round to a new center" carries both instruction and thematic subtext. Minor slip: "his mouth oval and vulnerable" and "a laugh brushed thin" edge toward stock gesture, though the overall rhythmic control under pressure remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: precise technical observation ("copper wire wrapped around oak branches, a hammer of driftwood, and my ear against bark") layered with lyric compression ("pillars dreamt the weather," "granite whales sounding for kin") that remains character-specific rather than generic poeticism. POV is stable first-person with clean psychic distance; the narrator's perceptual signature—systematic attention to material process, metaphors drawn from natural and architectural systems—coheres throughout. The diction modulates purposefully: clinical calm in early beats ("gently systematic hand so the stones would not mistake me for a frantic visitor"), then warm particularity in the chamber ("seeds like dark eyes," "weather marks, the orchard's memories"), and finally ceremonial stillness ("the ceremony of listening, a remodel of the heart"). Compression is taught early ("They were not carved; they were born") and sustained without opacity. Minor: the phrase "electrical grammar" and "crushed lightning" flirt with metaphorical inflation, but the surrounding concrete detail (wire, tremor, moss) anchors them as the narrator's idiosyncratic lexicon rather than purple drift. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, no voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: scientific lexicon blended with poetic compression ("bronze quiet," "clouds combed the river into threads"). POV remains stable first-person. Diction stays character-particular (academically rebellious scientist with lyric bent). Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Grief, I said, is also data"). Compression is purposeful and taught early ("manners can be molecular"). Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated. The prose reflects the narrator's stance—precise yet open to resonance—without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I learned to listen sideways," "narrow vastness," diction saturated in maritime and liturgical registers ("rosaries," "psalm," "bollards"). Purposeful compression ("Etruscan for smoke, Akkadian for floodplain") and patterned parallelism ("Tern says iron here, gull says alkaline there") are taught early and paid off at closure. The veteran's brief dialogue ("asking fares like he once asked orders") carries voice distinction and subtext. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what the coachman can know. Elision of the treaty's literal text serves the conceptual cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is highly metaphoric and consistent ("distance translated us," "desert kept no music," "settlement clanking like a sleeping animal learning to trust"), creating a distinct lyric voice. POV distance remains stable in close third, with psychic access limited to the narrator's sensory and emotional experience. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and remains legible, so purposeful compression applies. However, under peak pressure (copying letters, turning the spindle, hearing water), the elevated register does not modulate toward sharper immediacy, flattening some urgency. The brother's embedded voice in the cylinder riddles reads distinct in cadence and question structure, avoiding full convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "time dragging light as if mending it," "throat after singing," "river threw back a blurred aurora." Diction remains consistently elevated yet concrete, matching the technical observer's idiom. Psychic distance stays close and stable; no head-hopping. Minor density concern: some metaphors cluster heavily ("like spare cutlery," "black rope thrown to a sinking ship," "wet cloth") in early paragraphs, yet they remain legible and voice-consistent. Rhythmic control holds under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "apprentice of wonder" filters diction ("muffled palace of vapor," "snow moths"). Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows; elision of the teacher's identity and the old vow's origin is purposeful and charges closure when the scroll's wisdom lands. Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter cadence during the false-board split). One weakness: elevated register ("contravent," "sacredly playful") occasionally drifts from a plausible novice voice, though it reads consistent enough to hold as voice-motivated lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyric-dense and sustained, with a perceptual signature rooted in crisis-survival grammar ("drills inside me broke like cheap toys," "exits painted on the walls"). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The Custodian's dialogue carries distinct authority ("we only harvest the small"), though brief. Minor artifice: some metaphoric stacking in early paragraphs ("pause so wide the air itself seemed to hesitate," "absence could phosphoresce") approaches overwriting but stays legible and voice-consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between reflection and present action without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled metaphoric density: "memory grows teeth," "staircases loop like handwriting." POV remains stable third-person limited with a perceptual signature focused on sensing and interpreting abstractions. The prose's rhythmic modulation supports the Accumulative lens, but the lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("pavements of sensation," "hatching tiny pavements") that feels more authorial than character-bound. Dialogue is absent; the seer's statements blend into the narrator's voice without distinct idiom. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery are taught early and sustained, though filter verbs ("I realize," "I ask") appear frequently without undermining immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single tight POV with consistent perceptual signature: the tutor sees design, endgames, gambits, ranks. Diction remains elevated but rooted in his exile and craft ("winnow possibilities," "refusing comfort," "fierce repose"). Psychic distance narrows under pressure (the confrontation with remorse feels immediate). Brief dialogue in the final third ("asked my name, and I gave the truth") avoids filter clutter and advances closure. Free indirect style is clean. One hairline slip: "variations sprouting like vines" edges toward generic metaphor, but the rest of the figurative language (threads, knots, platinum gleam) stays grounded and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person singular voice is consistent and textured: poetic compression ("forged hush," "breath and bone"), elevated but character-rooted diction, and a perceptual signature that notices paint, echoes, and the spire's "blind gentleness." Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and angry—"confession nobody had ordered," "bookkeeping"—reflecting the artist's defiant stance. Purposeful syntactic variety and rhythm modulate with pressure. Minor: a few phrases approach lyricism that could obscure immediacy ("as if silence had been hammered on an anvil"), but they remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric-philosophical voice ("everything now happened between breaths held underwater," "salt in his eyes though there was no salt in this world"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the alchemist notices mechanical constellations, measures time in breaths, and frames memory as quilt-work. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible interiority—"kintsugi intentions," "shivered purposes," "vitriol and its memories"—reading more like authorial metaphor than character thought, creating minor register drift in peak beats. No dialogue appears; internal voice remains coherent but borders on over-wrought lyricism in places where compression would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and specific: "fading glints," "surfaces, water, and paint," "duration between ripples and drip." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during painting, pulled back during stranger encounter). Diction remains within the painter's idiom—lyric but grounded—and compression ("Rain kept to the offshore line, as if the horizon were a leash") is taught early and legible. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Internal voice ("I preferred intimately aloof, close in texture, far in claim") is distinct and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices resin stains, "teeth of the lens," the way metal can "soften like a throat." Diction is lyric-elevated ("the sea has finally cooled, a sigh uncoiling," "anger birds," "moon grew bare and mean") but consistent and voice-motivated; the narrator's childhood memory of jasmine anchors the register in embodied past. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (short clauses when the skiff turns). Dialogue is minimal and goal-driven: the narrator's whispered beckon and the closing reassurance carry subtext (care, exhaustion, community). Minor slip: "we have cold water and bread, and the books you love are waiting" risks exposition-as-comfort but the specificity (books, not generic solace) keeps it anchored. No head-hopping; free indirect remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices via professional bias (signal strength, moon phases, static texture) and personal metaphor ("the night becomes a tuned glass"). Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure—lyric compression ("a scab of stars," "night-sips") without register drift. One brief elision (the house and cloves) is anchored in present stimulus (Rowan's question) and paid off in the ending's deflection. Rowan's voice is filtered through the narrator's focalization; no head-hopping. Minor density at peaks (stacked modifiers in "Dawn gnaws the horizon when they reach the harbor, a rib cage of pilings") slightly dulls immediacy but remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters everything through rational foraging idiom ("methodical about spores and seasons," "logged outcomes like rainfall"). POV distance is stable; first-person interiority remains controlled. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "orchard hung from iron lines stapled into cliff faces," "rumor said the eye could occlude what hurts." Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Mara, Jiro, Fen speak briefly; their confessions advance the circle's test). Rhythmic control under pressure holds through the climax. No head-hopping or filter stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single first-person POV is stable and apt; distance remains consistent with lyric compression throughout. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and voice-particular: "gaps are the letters of the tide," "the seam of the world unthreading," "borrowed memories the way a neighbor lends a cup with a crack." Diction stays within the keeper's plausible lexicon—nautical, observational, metaphorically dense but legible. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (gaps, absences, borrowed) are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor note: density of figurative language is high across many consecutive sentences in the middle third; the pattern is consistent and voice-motivated, so no major penalty, but a brief breath might sharpen peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: "empirically intuitive," sensory specificity (calipers, burin, torn silk sound), metaphors rooted in maps and type (stars, ink returning to well). Psychic distance tightens during the cavern sequence and opens slightly for the communal ending, both intentional. Diction stays within character (typesetter's son, dealer in ephemera). Minor ding: "a lingering promise had kept him" and "his old motive flare" in early paragraphs lean slightly summary-first rather than anchoring the promise through concrete memory cue before naming it; the pattern improves as the piece progresses and interiority becomes more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person close POV remains stable; perceptual signature (vows "stirring like moths," starlight as "liquid cloth") is consistent and voice-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer in the cobalt vault, wider during the ridge descent). The two brief dialogue exchanges ("Your dreams match our oldest contour lines," "Walk with me") carry subtext and goal pursuit without over-articulation. Diction ("filigree that weighed like threat," "dusk polish the stones") controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping or filter stacks; the prose stays clean and immediate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person present, distance controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature is consistent (scientific precision layered with lyric metaphor). The voice is distinct in diction ("scientifically romantic," "massful," "sleepy flare") and rhythm, with purposeful compression in lines like "presence would swell around joy, then thin when grief traced its cooling finger." Dialogue is minimal but functional: Lio's lines ("You brought the cobalt vials"; "the moment is almost ripe") feel natural and goal-driven. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("desire is massful only when mirrored by respect") that reads more like thesis than thought under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains close throughout. The narrator's lexicon is consistent—scientific yet poetic—though some metaphoric density borders on opacity without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "names are traps," "jealousy is a magnet for loose iron," "memories are all bent nails until you face their rust." POV distance is stable; first-person focalization stays consistent through dream and waking. Diction remains character-particular and lyric without register drift. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (e.g., "I told the dream I would not be fooled") are taught early and legible. Rhythmic control under pressure: "I wrote…until my knuckles creaked, mapping envy into paths and paths into story." One minor slip: "consensus reality" moment when wind, stones, and hawk all attend the reading risks slight anthropomorphic convergence, though it reads as metaphorical rather than literal POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV first-person voice is stable and distinct: the protagonist's perceptual signature (listening over smelling, reading pauses, exhaling to fog glass) is consistent and filters all observation. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Time for a first cry," "the screw is special"). One vulnerability: the final Master Isidor paragraph shifts briefly toward summary omniscience ("He hears it too"), a micro-distance slip that does not break focalization but loosens control. Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon, though "occluded views" in one line feels slightly elevated for the moment's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-close; perceptual signature is distinct (the way the protagonist notices red thread, crescent scars, the quill's shaft). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "raincrow's eye," "history leaned close," "shorelines that taught me the shape of the sea." Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; inference reads as inference ("as if listening forward"). Psychic distance shifts are intentional (zooming in to the quill tip, pulling back to Elder Nam's eyes on the horizon). Free indirect style is clean; internal thought formatting is consistent. Elder Nam's speech carries subtext and goal-pursuit ("the opening rune must be written as if spoken to a child, not an army"). One friction: the phrase "by revisiting youthful superstitions" in the mid-section reads slightly expository, though it anchors the reflective turn and does not flatten voice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent diction ("byline that sold hauntings like sequins," "metronomes with loose springs"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: vivid metaphor in calm reflection, compressed syntax under stress ("The shelves knocked out a slow backbeat"). Dialogue is minimal but natural ("try telling yourself that when you sleep"). Perceptual signature is strong (attention to paper, breath, copper, scent). Minor: "Record it, Mara mouthed" shifts briefly to external observation without filter, a hairline distance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    First-person singular POV is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature ("wanderingly exact," "I stopped counting and offered my attention like a bowl") is consistent and lyric. Diction ("resounding hush," "ant trail of letters," "thin dew of meaning") is controlled and purposeful, with syntactic variety supporting rhythm. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("balances settled not by vote but by trajectory," "History eased around the dais") that feels more philosophical than embodied in the narrator's present urgency, and the lack of on-page dialogue limits voice testing. Distance and tense remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a perceptual signature filtered through occupational idiom ("custody of drips and brass," "syllable off," "moth colored bellies"). POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction remains character-consistent (technical precision layered with poetic compression). A few lines edge toward elevated register ("eminently peculiar," "bruise colored clouds"), but the effect reads voice-motivated rather than generic. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: longer interleaved clauses during reflection, shorter declaratives during valve work. No dialogue to judge. Minor deduction for one or two abstract phrasings ("truth through pain") that slightly soften immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable first-person with a consistent perceptual signature: probability-inflected ("soft probability distribution," "pulse that kept miscounting"), specific idiom ("clover melancholy," "the house could not win"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You followed the markers," "they were lucky"). The prose modulates under pressure without losing coherence: shorter phrases when discovering his handwriting, more reflective rhythms in the final paragraphs. Filter verbs ("I pictured," "I thought") are voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy. One minor slip: "the tired smile I knew returned" could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision ("trunk lines unspool," "copper") blended with lyric compression ("a song once lived here and now prefers to hum from behind the words"). Distance modulates purposefully—close in ritual moments (wet thumb on disc), wider in recounting past calls. Diction remains voice-consistent: "melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement," "orphans of intention" feel operator-specific rather than generic. Purposeful compression ("I learned early the science of cultivated estrangement") is taught as the operator's idiom and paid off in the fadeout. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (final pairing) the voice stays controlled, fitting the operator's studied restraint. Rhythm breathes with the hum motif.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV archivist voice is distinct and stable: "to weigh each murmur and make it legible," "the euphoria…is haunted by her absence, the exact flavor of duty." Perceptual signature (ritual objects, tidal rhythms, textural metaphors) is consistent and role-specific. Kellen's brief dialogue ("if I will write her back into the roll") advances plot and carries subtext without filter clutter. Purposeful compression in lines like "her laugh almost arrive" fits the lyric accumulation. One slip: "the exact flavor of duty" edges toward over-articulation, and occasional elevated diction ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant") risks register drift, though it remains plausibly role-bound for an archivist.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds Mara's perceptual bias (rumors "like birds," logistics as attention, the rock "adjusting its coat"). Diction is lyric-patterned and idiom-consistent ("anarchy remembering its manners," "wishes fulfilled and wishes pending"). Psychic distance narrows at peak beats (the surveyor meeting, the counter announcement) and widens for camp panoramas purposefully. However, elevated register ("striated," "catalyze," "polite anarchy") occasionally drifts above the folk-logistician frame, and several figurative vehicles ("rumors roosted," "corridors from crates") stack without breathing room in the middle third, slightly reducing clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a perceptual signature rooted in tactile and auditory metaphor: "Words became pulses, pulses became direction." The elevated diction ("nave," "dowse," "poise") remains consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. However, the prose occasionally inflates into register drift—"uncoil upwards, not loud, but a steady anchor the world swiveled around"—and the syntactic uniformity (many sentences open with subject-verb-object patterns or prepositional phrases) flattens rhythm under pressure. The final paragraph's summary mode ("His maps thereafter were patience arranged…") shifts psychic distance abruptly, diluting immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "regretful starlight," "strange comfort like a blanket woven from echoes," syntax matching the narrator's ruminative, precise stance. POV modesty holds—inference reads as inference ("Call it superstition, but superstition is just a lover's name for the physics we do not yet model"). Mara's brief dialogue on the comm carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor slip: a few lines edge toward elevated diction ("winnow what holds from what lets go") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally slow momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled, with lyric compression consistent throughout ("their wrists draw harbors; their palms make moons"). No head-hopping; focalization remains stable on the narrator. However, perceptual signature occasionally slips into elevated diction ("seethe," "fletching arrows of meaning") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The advisor's dialogue carries subtext but her voice converges with the narrator's poetic register under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature appears in pattern-obsessed diction: "smoke graphs its own arguments," "dust...a retired constellation auditing." Distance remains stable in close third with lyric compression throughout. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("desire computes trajectories even numbers envy," "salted into anonymity") that strains the POV's plausible lexicon mid-crisis. The cipher-decoding and breath-map narration maintain voice-specific texture. Mira's single line of dialogue—"you do not worship flames...you listen"—carries goal and subtext cleanly, but her minimal on-page speech limits assessment of voice distinction between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable and apt; the narrator's perceptual signature (synesthetic attention to sound, metallic taste, rhythm as language) remains consistent under pressure. Purposeful compression ("security drones drifted like drowsy moths," "the garden dimmed back to ordinary miracle") creates lyric density without obscuring causality. Diction stays within the narrator's poetic-technical register; metaphors remain coherent and voice-motivated. Minor friction: occasional elevated phrasing ("auroral sorrow," "cathedral patience built from singing molecules") edges toward ornament in peak beats, though it stops short of distancing the reader from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The perceptual signature is consistent and job-specific: sounds as "paused on rusted grating," "the pitch softened," the courier's "left foot dragging a fraction late," "the fresh tar smell." Distance is stable (single POV, first-person). Diction is voice-motivated and lyric without obscuring clarity: "corrugations and walks farther by not fighting," "the world prefers corners," "a dog biting its tail." Dialogue is minimal (Otero's challenge, the courier's whispered "thank you") but functional. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure: short declaratives during the challenge ("Turn right…do not run"), longer reflective lines in the opening and closing. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the guardian notices "ripples I chose not to disturb," "shutters that lace the alleys," "the dark blinked, not angry, only drowsy." Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("spiralingly calm," "starched throat," "ticking against my ribs"). Compression and lyricism are purposeful and taught early. The boys' silence and the guardian's finger-raise function as clean dialogue substitutes. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses during the retrieval, longer cadence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The first-person POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, noticing "twitch and rattle of thoughts"). Diction is consistently elevated and metaphorical throughout, which reads as voice-consistent rather than register drift. The psychic ability to "hear" thoughts is handled with restraint and specificity ("groan of worry, metallic clink of ambition"). Deductions for two issues: the phrase "during the hush where past meets prophecy" is repeated verbatim twice, creating template cadence; and the elevated register occasionally obscures immediacy in peak beats (e.g., "amplified quiet lean toward us") where compression might serve better. No dialogue present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a maritime-inflected perceptual signature: "moon jellies write their slow cursive," "wet rope pulled through a cleat," "argument with the sea." Diction remains controlled and idiomatically consistent. The old pirate's dialogue—"Fight the tide gently, and let it win"—carries subtext and distinct rhythm. Purposeful lyric compression (mosaic structure with repeated refrains) is taught early and paid off at closure. Brief register elevation in philosophical turns ("combative tenderness," "detach from habits of hauling and blaming") feels voice-motivated rather than imposed, though the pattern's density in reflective beats occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, perceptual signature distinct (turbines as scythes, water "agrees to be less than cloud," straw-and-dust duel). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "adhesive kept its ghostly shine," "petals frayed into soft shrapnel," "pale commas." The performer's dramatized narration is quoted directly, creating meta-texture without head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens during the inspector scene, then breathes at dusk. Minimal dialogue (inspector's two lines, performer's responses) is subtext-rich and goal-driven. Slight slip: "morally ambiguous in their stories" and "he does not know either" risk slight tell, though they're filtered through community perception and interior stance. No head-hopping, no filter stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable focalization through the poet's perception. The prose texture is distinct—lyric, compressed, with purposeful metaphor ("cloud shadows," "lantern-moth hush," "salt releases the color in buried shells"). Diction remains elevated and consistent, voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page. A few lines border on over-figuration ("pathway ghosts forward," "air becomes granular with new permission") but the register holds and the compression pattern is taught early. Psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (aesthetic, patient, scar-smoothed) filters setting and action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Ilias with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (colorblind trust in "value, shadow, pulse, and weight"). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality. The prose carries a distinct texture ("innocently cunning restraint," "thready rainbows"), and lexicon stays character-appropriate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close on Ilias's micro-choices, wider on the courtyard's collective response). Minor penalty: under peak pressure (the reed insertion), some sentences lean slightly elevated ("seating brass inside the thin arterial fault") when plainness might sharpen immediacy, and the piece occasionally uses filter constructions ("he says little, holding to his motive") that could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices light refraction, coal memory, harmonic angles, and interprets silence as "a room waiting for company." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("bellows," "obedient fans," "shy edge that yields only to careful fingertips"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: the child's question about forgiveness and the narrator's response ("listening might be") advance the thematic stakes. Minor slip: the priest of logistics and some visitors speak in register that occasionally converges with the narrator's elevated syntax ("donors prefer obvious arrivals"), slightly reducing voice distinction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature (jeweler's eye: "micromesh," "breathing chambers," "braided from patience"). Voice is lyric-accumulative with purposeful compression and elevated diction consistent throughout. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical phrasing ("listener to intervals," "gentle thresholds between withering and blossom") that feels writerly rather than character-bound under pressure. No dialogue on page to judge. Psychic distance and focalization remain controlled; no head-hopping. Elision is taught early (the ritual's mechanics unfold gradually) and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV distance is stable; first-person singular with consistent perceptual bias toward metaphor and inherited memory. The voice has a distinct lyric texture ("grit-bright hush," "siren sighed past") but diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("lattice of constellations waiting to fall into meaning") that feels more decorative than character-particular. No dialogue is present; the cartomancer's and narrator's speech is reported indirectly, which is acceptable but misses an opportunity for voice distinction. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("multiplying paths," "confide") are taught early and held, but the final paragraph's "borrowed our breath" risks softening into poetic vagueness rather than concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, first person. Perceptual signature is distinct: "I read by walking, advancing towards a column until sorrow thinned, turning aside until wonder rose." Diction is elevated and consistent—"anguished joy," "foreign country," "interference in irregular counsel"—though under peak stress the register remains ornate rather than compressing. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is stable; the voice modulates purposefully without unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "what the light forgets," shelves with "softly deliberate" steps, and filters setting through curatorial attention (catalog tones, pollen of letters). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("where day loosens its buckle," "gathers courage from my held breath") without register drift. No dialogue; the shadow "wants to speak, but cannot," which fits the atmospheric design. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator infers the shadow's memory through imagery rather than claiming certainty. Minor density in figurative language occasionally stacks (e.g., "gathered glints…dusk…courage" in one line) but remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric-textural: "silence had a way of listening," "stories collapsed," "faith without care becomes a blade." POV distance is stable; the handler's perceptual signature (noticing mesh, splinters, animal coil) is character-specific. The prose compresses purposefully—"he told the long truth, peeling it forward by shedding layers"—and the pattern is taught early. Karim's dialogue is indirect and embodied. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV with stable first-person distance. Voice is distinct and lyric ("meteor hush that rings like distant glass," "green rain, shy and certain"), with diction calibrated to the protagonist's forensic mindset and poetic precision. The fern's and ivy's "speech" is rendered as thought-address rather than dialogue, maintaining focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist notices coffee rings as tree rings, reads scars as stories, and processes pain through figurative precision. Brief compression under pain ("pain salts the floor with stars") fits the heightened state. No head-hopping; the plants' voices are experienced as telepathic intrusion, not separate POV. Elision of the miracle's exact mechanics is purposeful and paid off through the negotiated retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "spatially imaginative," mapmaker idiom ("topography made of sprocket holes and splice tape"), sensory filtering through the psychometry frame. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though elevated throughout ("domesticated storm chained to gears," "sentences begging for boats"). Under peak pressure (the psychometry reading itself), syntax compresses slightly but voice texture remains consistent. The manager's direct speech is brief and functional; the gazer's idiom is singular. Minor density concern: stacked figurative constructions in most sentences risk overwriting, but coherence holds and the effect reads intentional for lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with a consistent texture in diction ("moonstruck dreamer," "star-salted mantle," "hour between breaths") and a perceptual signature that filters the world through remembered stardust and silent sound. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person, and the protagonist's way of noticing—"aurora rippled as if amused," "ground rang like a bell"—is selective and biased toward celestial metaphor. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that, while beautiful, can feel crafted for effect rather than urgent interiority under pressure ("syllables, remembered stardust stitching itself into lullabies and oaths and brushstrokes"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and mostly paid off, though some transitions ("stepped into a night deeper than weather") rely on poetic license that slightly obscures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and controlled: third-person limited holds to the guard's perceptual signature (tracks "knot," dunes "drape," bloomlight brushes boots), and diction stays within his railman's idiom (sleepers, sidings, switching yard). Compression and patterned elision are purposeful—"he is occasionally everywhere" recurs as a taught motif, and the wave-function dispersal is signaled early and paid off at closure. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction in key beats: "interference chisels a door from certainty," "names without bodies, gestures without hands" read as authorial gloss rather than the guard's interior texture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The perceptual signature is distinct but occasionally sacrifices embodied immediacy for lyric distance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistently lyric and metaphor-dense, with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical nature observed through sound and embodied sensation). POV distance is stable first-person present, and the diction maintains elevated, poetic register throughout. Under peak pressure (the tower doorway, the mirror revelation), syntax compresses appropriately without losing coherence. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating rhythmic uniformity and slight register drift: phrases like "a migration of tones that shepherd me" and "the grammar of wind" read as writerly performance rather than the philosopher's situated idiom. The piece teaches its pattern early, so the density is purposeful, but the pervasive metaphor flattens urgency in high-stakes beats (the tower opening, the chewing) where plainer diction might sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The POV is stable and lyric throughout, with a consistent perceptual signature that notices metaphorically ("sea sigh," "bruise warming into lavender," "moonbread air"). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The guides' dialogue ("the tide already paid them in returned names") feels purposefully stylized and matches the dreamlike register. Some figurative density approaches overwriting in cumulative effect, and a few coinages ("moonbread") test the boundary of voice-motivated invention, but the texture remains coherent and the prose reflects the focalizer's transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV is stable; psychic distance is intimate and controlled throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("snow steamed," "velvet," "frostbitten hope thawing") that reflects the protagonist's heightened perceptual state during nerve regeneration. Diction remains within the narrator's register, though elevated phrasing ("seraphically mundane," "parliament of sensation") occasionally drifts toward the literary-essay register under peak pressure. The bellhop's silent communication via gesture and the protagonist's whispered and spoken lines are purposeful and goal-driven. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I saw," "I told him") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narration holds a lyric, elevated register throughout ("a diminutive titan, regally unpretentious," "corridors slid to new alignments nobody but Lys could map"). POV remains stable in third-limited on Lys, and the diction—archaic, dense, metaphor-heavy—suits the timeless library. However, under peak pressure (the confrontation with the pretender) the prose does not modulate; it sustains the same ornate texture when urgency might compress. The pretender's dialogue ("I have improved our story, sanded it smooth") and Lys's silence create contrast, but other characters (historian, gardener) speak in narration's voice rather than distinct idiom. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the issue is tonal uniformity that flattens beats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, compressed yet legible: "the tides still rehearse old griefs," "gulls heckle like unpaid auditors," "a mirage paved with glinting eels and rumor." POV distance is stable, first-person with reflective access that remains anchored (tapping the railing, crossing the flats). Perceptual signature is scientist-mourner: grief for reefs, precision with tide records, poetic phrasing for natural cycles. Jun's waltz reply and the village woman's ghost question carry subtext without exposition. Syntax modulates with emotional weight: short declaratives at crisis ("I do not see that yet"), longer cadences at insight. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Purposeful compression ("I send slow taps along the pipe") is taught and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: poetic, deliberate diction ("ribcage without a heart," "algae on dark water") matched to a reflective, observant focalizer. POV distance is stable; interior access never leaks. The broadcast passage shifts into direct address without losing narrative stance, and the replies arrive as concrete fragments (tool codes, lullabies, laughter) that feel natural. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the protagonist notices angles, hums, and constellations, filtering through skin and patient looking. No head-hopping or register mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; diction ("insurgent grandmother," "sermon in vitrines," "middle music") is distinctly voice-driven and character-particular. Perceptual signature: Mara notices plant murmurs, mineral thirst, chlorophyll translation—details filtered through her accidental telepathy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during ritual, wider for reconstruction framing). Minor slips: "the botanists muttered while avoiding her eyes" is efficient setup but slightly tells; "as if the springs themselves moved to unseal" leans explanatory. Rhythm varies naturally and compression under ritual pressure (short breaths, heat/cool cycles) supports tension without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-POV, close third with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: she reads tremor as "memory, not command," misses "the idea of someone watching weather." Diction remains character-particular ("the sea had more of it than any of them could hold") and modulates under pressure without breaking voice. Brief dialogue is goal-driven and carries subtext ("we are not abandoning it, we are listening to it"). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she said") are minimal and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no register drift, no tense slips. Purposeful compression in the ceremony sequence maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: "dust bodied itself into sentences," "fogbones," "heart thudding in the tower." POV distance remains stable (close third focused on the artist), and the compression of abstract phrases ("fragmented reality," "luminescent ache") reads as voice-motivated rather than filter clutter. However, some constructions edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the moment's pressure ("messy theology of maintenance," "barnacled memories"), and brief diction drift in peak beats (e.g., "rhetorical questions, questions rhetorical questions") blurs immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    First-person voice is distinct and sustained: "stubborn as flint," "the clock coughing sand," "fossiled crisis hanging like a lantern." Psychic distance remains stable, and the high-pressure crossing ("I let myself disappear") compresses diction appropriately while internal texture persists. Purposeful elision at the threshold is taught early and paid off in the return with algebra. Minor slip: a few filter-verb clusters ("I watch," "I tell them") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats, and one late phrase ("clicking incontrovertible algebra") edges toward elevated register without full voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register—compressed, patterned, and voice-specific—through metaphors tied to breathing, archiving, and winter. POV is stable single third-person limited, with psychic distance controlled: the archivist's perceptual signature is professional (catalogs, capsules, networks) layered with poetic precision ("sentences kissed like steel meeting flint"). The dialogue moment (shadow asking for tea) is minimal but purposeful, breaking the silence with intimate understatement. Compression is taught early ("time reduced to a breathing machine") and sustained. Minor slip: a few phrases approach stock lyricism ("love letter to silence itself") but the surrounding texture recovers specificity. No head-hopping; elision of the shadow's identity is purposeful and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person voice is distinct and controlled: perceptual signature filters through patience and micro-attention ("I notice pain even before it speaks," "their buds promising difficult patience"). Diction remains stable and voice-motivated even under pressure (the storm sequence maintains the narrator's textured cadence). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the father's lines pursue goals and carry subtext, and his final "your way has heat" crystallizes his shift without over-articulation. Minor slip: occasional elevated phrasing ("inculcating plants with values") brushes against the narrator's otherwise grounded idiom, though it reads as her learned vocabulary rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct lyric register ("moonwater," "star milk," "windchimes"). Purposeful compression and metaphoric density are consistent and taught early. Two significant weaknesses lower the score: (1) The phrase "transliterates emotions" recurs as a near-label across multiple beats without evolving into embodied action, reading as thematic claim rather than lived perception. (2) Perceptual specificity wavers—"He knew the echo of a goddess when it walked through him, because it wore his bones like windchimes" is vivid, but several lines ("People said he transliterates emotions without a pen") feel like external commentary rather than the fisher's own noticing. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinctive perceptual signature: newsprint metaphors ("floor hums like a printing press," "sky were a hollow cello"), embodied history (grandmother's pen nib), and a syntax that fuses journalistic precision with poetic compression ("solemn playfulness in every comma"). The dialogue—Kline's coffee offer, the protagonist's requests for raw logs, the technician exchange—is spare and goal-driven with subtext in the pen nib's symbolic placement. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the climax, wider at dawn). Minor friction: the long sentences in high-pressure beats occasionally delay momentum, and a few phrases ("possessed of the steady, cruel patience") drift toward elevated register that edges past immediate crisis idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and distinctive: "thistle hiss," "mothlight," "dawn plotted across steel." Perceptual signature is consistent (amber-lens filtering, constellation-mapping) and diction remains character-particular throughout. The narrative stance modulates under pressure—lines shorten during the waveform's cry, expand during reflective beats—without head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression ("when time folds in on itself") is taught early and legible. No dialogue appears; interiority carries the full load cleanly. Minor density in figurative language (nearly every sentence in peak beats carries metaphor) holds because the pattern is established and the voice is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a lyric, metaphor-dense idiom ("listening backward," "fruit of pauses," "low tide revealing ribs of a wreck") that reflects the artist's perceptual training. Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (hush as seam, mandala as map) are taught early and pay off at closure. However, figurative saturation in nearly every sentence risks decorative density—"braided patience," "pooled seashell thoughts," "tiny door vibrating open"—that occasionally slows momentum without advancing choice. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext (man asking about the spiral, child about survival) and the artist's replies serve as gentle redirections rather than explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person present with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: warm coldness, "a gentle radical," retrocognitive breach. Diction remains character-specific—"tessera as a seed that never learned to sprout," "guilt can be taught to lay down its hands"—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. The brief past-vision of the guard and fig story is anchored in the tessera; the leader's sparse dialogue ("what I am") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: a few elevated metaphors ("peeled fruit" sky) verge on lyric excess but stay voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person ghost POV maintains stable perceptual signature: synesthetic filtering (taste footsteps, hear color, see pitch of silence) remains consistent and purposeful throughout, shaping navigation and perception. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("encore-seeking stage ghost," "cobwebbed spotlights," "rumor of coolness"). Rowan's single line of dialogue ("Please keep the path tomorrow...") carries goal and subtext without over-articulation. Brief compression under peak pressure (coin-flip sequence, hedge rearrangement) stays legible. No head-hopping; the ghost infers Rowan's state through observed action (cracked hands, steady eyes from crying) without claiming her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "feathered edges," "limp-clicking," "willowglass hope made mineral." Diction modulates under pressure—short clauses during the wristband dance, longer rhythm when reflecting on the recall. Mara's voice in dialogue is practical and mooring ("Hold," "tell me everything slowly"), distinct from the protagonist's lyric interiority. Filter use is voice-motivated ("felt like a key"). Purposeful compression ("the door was breathing") is taught early and paid off at closure when the door stays "careful, quivering open." No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the experiment and breathes in the loft.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable and apt; perceptual signature is distinct (professional filter of "trace gases," "microtemporal steps," "salinity lulls" mixed with embodied emotion). Diction remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon—scientific idiom blended with lyric compression ("dripping language of intervals and vanishing vowels"). Purposeful compression ("the phrase fits," "I realize") is taught early and remains legible. Minor filter-verb density in mid-section beats ("I set," "I press," "I lift") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure clarity. No head-hopping; narrative distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person voice is consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature—"honeyed," "ribs," "moons of cloth"—anchored in the turner's archival sensibility. The voice modulates smoothly from solitary reflection to communal "we" in the final third, a purposeful shift that tracks the story's thematic arc. However, the collective "we" flattens individual texture; lines like "We walk it, not to flee but to fetch" adopt a choral register that loses the earlier idiosyncratic cadence. Psychic distance is stable within first-person bounds, though the narrator's certainty about town sentiment ("They say…," "only surrender saves") and the echo's content ("It says, when many hands…") occasionally asserts knowledge beyond direct perception without dramatizing how it was learned. The syntax carries lyric patterning—parallelism, anaphora ("every button…every garment…every backstory")—that teaches its mode early and pays off in the spiral's recursive logic. Filter verbs ("I hear," "I say") appear frequently but feel voice-motivated in an introspective, cataloging narrator. The final shift to past tense in "The hourglass turner does not end a future; the hourglass turner organizes it" introduces distance for aphoristic closure, a minor tense inconsistency that serves rhetorical emphasis but blurs the present-tense frame.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is controlled and the perceptual signature is consistent (wind as "careful hand," snow as "sifted salt," mist that "pressed" figures). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe," "small nation of promises") that feels voice-motivated but borders on overwrought during peak beats. The stranger's dialogue carries subtext ("prudently daring, careful with your courage but not stingy") but reads slightly expository. Psychic distance remains appropriate; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with action but some figurative density in the opening slows momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and tightly controlled: "fog breathed," "shivering light," "percolate through the damp and iron." Diction remains within the narrator's reflective, slightly archaic register without drift. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. The coachman's brief dialogue feels natural and purposeful. Minor density concern: occasional stacked modifiers ("closely attentive," "spindrift serenity") approach decorative in mid-passage, though they charge the closure when reprised. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under peak pressure (the trembling stitch).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "slow enough to hear clay explaining itself," "phototropic to kindness," "cemented not by force but by gentle repetitions." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person, with perception filtered through craft idiom (slip, kiln, glaze). Non-standard syntax ("by the glass I found the hour") and compression ("which over years harden like glaze against ruin's fingers") are purposeful and legible. Filter verbs appear ("I thought it was my blood, then the wind") but remain voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("the ligament that held this place against the jerk of heat, war, and forgetting") yet stays within a contemplative potter's plausible register under the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person voice is distinct and consistent: selective perception (harbor spills like milk, tar keeps sun), compression without opacity, and a patient, specific idiom ("reminds the lock of opening"). Psychic distance stays close; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven: "No saints, just angles and a tooth with an honest bite." Filter verbs ("I feel my heart move") are voice-motivated and sparse. The narrator's perceptual signature—watching ripples hold breath, seeing light as promise—remains stable under pressure. Minor slip: a few reflective beats in the first third slightly flatten urgency before the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistently elevated ("wet-lipped bookspines," "memory arrives like frost and splinters at a touch"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The Librarian conversation "by gestures, because speech in that room turned to foam" is clever but borders on convenient filter rather than dramatized limitation. Perceptual signature is idiosyncratic, though register stays high throughout without modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyric, tightly controlled, and perceptually distinct: "letters I carry swell with damp, their edges scalloped like lilies." POV distance is stable; the narrator's way of noticing (letters as living things, geometry as patience) remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, advancing plot and subtext ("let your own breath be the first permission you grant"). Minor slip: the boy's question and grandmother's action feel slightly convenient as validation beats, though they do not break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent professional diction (signal interpreter, gate valve, ionosphere thieves, synthesis rack) and a perceptual signature that filters environment through radio metaphor ("antenna tower hums like a spine," "riddles that sound like meteor scatter"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate interiority during chart-reading and patching, then pulls back to observe the quad's campsite certainty. Sentence rhythm accelerates during the climax ("I click the patch bay, feed the subsonic scaffold under a hymn of static, and breathe with it") and slows at closure ("healing is slower than harm and tastes stranger"). However, several beats display template cadence and filter-verb stacks: "They probe…then whisper…Students turn…professors against…administrators against…donors against" (list paralysis); "rumors say…another rumor says" (synonym loop). The final paragraph's "That is my ethic, ethereal grit" risks breaking the established voice with a tidy self-summary, though the phrase ties to prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors drawn from geometry, music, and breath; diction that blends precision and lyricism ("spatial mutiny," "harmonics transfix"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer under vault pressure, wider when surveying the square). Free indirect style is clean, and the protagonist's lexicon—claustrophobic explorer with blueprint training—remains consistent. Minor weaknesses: a few elevated constructions ("letting the harmonics transfix the spatial mutiny without bruising it into obedience") occasionally edge toward overwriting but remain voice-coherent and legible under the lyric mode the piece teaches early.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lio with controlled distance; perceptual signature is distinct (textures, breath cadences, "temperatures of grief"). Diction stays within Lio's plausible register—"woolen quiet of fog," "metrical logic," "sorrow's pulsation"—with vocabulary consistent for a trained artist and former river kid. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the captain's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit. Deductions: some elevated constructions ("the metrical logic that his eyes had always withheld," "the quarry's slow alphabet on fabric") occasionally drift toward lyric register that feels authorial rather than Lio's internal voice under pressure. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he heard," "he understood") cluster in the captain's confession sequence, dulling immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: "boots feel too loud," "paper keeps my pulse honest," "logic of salt, empire, and thrift meeting me here." Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("spongey dread," "filaments forward like spared mercy," "sea...answers only in the patient yawning of holes"). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable. Minor penalty for "plywood floors that never dry" and "intercom that coughs foreground static" reading slightly elevated in register for a narrator under waterlogged duress, and for the phrase "navigational poetics" arriving without prior POV grounding in that exact term.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistently lyric: "a tightrope for thoughts I will not cross unless the string knows my name." Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (cataloging glint, tar smell, gullies) is character-specific. Dialogue feels purposeful but occasionally over-articulate for spoken exchange ("pixelated amnesty, forgiveness arriving by tiny squares of brightness"). No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Diction remains within the narrator's reflective register, though some metaphors ("brightness and shade that battle politely") verge on precious.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "polished calm," "rings that coaxed," "reputational gravity," "gathered the bills like birds." The voice sustains lyric compression and metaphoric density without obscuring causality. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue with the kid is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (ghosts = inherited patterns). Minor deduction: a few lines approach elevated diction that slightly exceeds the established register ("dusky harmony," "reliquary") but remain voice-motivated and legible. Free indirect style is clean; tense is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: lucid-dream chronicler lexicon ("fast falling," "breath letter," "wet stone turning into wheat") shapes every observation. Dialogue is minimal and goal-driven—Mara's "The inscriptions describe a ritual of attention" and the narrator's response advance the decoding work. Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure, though "bruised her throat" and "shoulders lower as if untied" rely on embodied metaphor that occasionally drifts toward poetic convenience rather than character-specific sensation. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I watched," "I felt") are voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance tight. Perceptual signature is martial throughout: "spear to shield," "helmets stacked after drill," "handed a final order." Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short syntax during the seed's feeding, longer cadence during the walk out. Minor slip: "the guarded druid" in the opening reads slightly expository for a character we track intimately, but voice recovers immediately. Diction stays within Issa's warrior-druid lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices through a lens of roots, covenants, and mystical architecture ("scars the way bark knits after lightning"). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("storm milk," "marrow of the air," "ferrying the futures"), matching the visionary stance. However, the register holds one high lyric pitch throughout without modulation under peak pressure, and the girl's brief dialogue ("if I am the door or the person who stands before it") feels slightly more grounded than the surrounding narration, creating minor voice tension.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is poetic and controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: "breathing architecture of memory and debt," "resolve like a shawl," "humming that sounded like bees in snow." POV remains stable third-limited, no head-hopping. Dialogue ("You have come to barter more, she said, or to complain at what you bought with your crying") carries subtext and advances plot. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism that tests the protagonist's immediate experience under duress: "dusky resolve settled in my bones" and "every bargain given a witness who would not lie" read more authorial than character-lived. Psychic distance is mostly consistent; the card's blink and the brother's laugh are filtered through perception rather than stated omnisciently.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-POV stability throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters all observation through roadie/appraiser expertise (tweed combos, output transformers, rental logos). Diction remains character-bound ("souvenir work," "ozone and beer," "pellets after the snare splits") and modulates under pressure—compressed syntax in the grille cloth examination, expansive rhythm in the valley's final answer. Lark's brief dialogue ("We keep finding bits…") carries natural rhythm and advances plot. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around the cloth, broadens for Lark's history, then narrows again at closure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters sensation through craft idiom (wedges, calibrations, syllables, tablets, vowels), syntactic parallelism ("tasting salt, tasting ozone, tasting the absence"), and measured cadence that modulates under pressure without fragmenting. Purposeful compression and lyric repetition ("After the spirit leaves…" frames beginning and near-end) teach a pattern that the piece pays off at closure. Diction remains within the translator's register—technical terms (cuneiform, magnets, poles, gradients) are precise and voice-motivated; elevated phrasing ("etiquette of its refusal," "amphorae that pour their shape forward") reads as the narrator's idiolect rather than authorial decoration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens cleanly when the coil speaks and the narrator answers, then eases into the collective future ("we will read the air together") without disorientation. The final line's tonal shift from solitary to communal feels earned by the prior reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors drawn from gears, tides, smelting, cataloguing. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection on the tide priest, pulled back for visitor interactions). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("feathers of history slipping through definitions," "the moon lifts a shoulder"), controlled and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no dialogue on the page to assess naturalism. Minor register drift into abstractness ("fluctuate with moon phases," "imbalance") occasionally softens specificity, but rhythmic control under pressure remains strong and the voice reads singular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, blending occupational idiom ("calibrated to measure seams and seals") with lyric compression ("corridors intersecting the caverns like knuckles inside a glass hand"). Psychic distance is consistent, and perceptual signature—focus on acoustic resonance, touch, and latent charge—colors every beat. Diction remains character-specific under pressure. One slip: "the reason I ever broke protocol: to dissolve the walls between hearts" edges toward thesis statement rather than filtering through the narrator's operational language. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The closing rhythm ("the empty tin in my pocket ticked") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices mica "like dragon teeth sunk in abandoned gums" and labels the bench "Datum A" with a scout's precision, revealing both professional habit and self-aware irony. Diction remains within the character's lexicon (truth-seeking chronicler, mapmaker) and modulates under pressure without register drift. Free indirect style is clean; the accordion's wheeze "sounded like the culvert breathing" anchors sensation in the present. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I told him," "I whispered") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, though they remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV maintained throughout with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the veil filters certainty, the watch rhythm structures perception, and the dreamer's cautious exuberance colors every observation. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific ("cautious exuberance," "measured presence," "confidence man's watch"). No dialogue present; interiority is purposeful. Purposeful compression in phrases like "the unfolding cipher used distance and waiting as its ink" is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor register elevation in a few phrases ("propagation delays," "ledger bound in mist") but stays within the dreamer's contemplative idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person POV is stable, psychic distance intimate and consistent. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinctive: professional provenance vocabulary ("authenticate the chain of ownership, initials and seals") interwoven with lyric-mystic diction ("vow waiting to be kept," "mulberry ache"). Purposeful compression and patterned line breaks serve the accumulative design; the piece teaches its cadence early ("I came early to weigh a dream against an empire") and maintains it through closure. Free indirect blurs slightly when plants "speak" ("Your hands can propagate what truth the empire cannot catalog, it says"), but the convention is taught and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric register: "the hush thickened until I felt the stone listening to me back," "a returning tide that recognized the shore made of her bones." Perceptual signature is consistent—professional attention to detail (eyelids, wrist resonance test) mixed with metaphoric phrasing. The prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the emerald ritual, longer accumulative syntax in reflective beats. One friction: the elevated diction ("coax whatever glowed to hold," "infuse each parting with the truth of remaining") occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction that slightly distances the reader from immediate embodied action, though it remains voice-coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single first-person POV remains stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—patient, vineyard-inflected diction ("ripening," "canes," "spur"), and vocabulary consistent with caretaking. Psychic distance is steady; narrative certainty matches the narrator's reflective stance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unseamed," "scallop the clay basins to sip more sky") that, while lyric and controlled, edges toward decoration in non-peak beats. Dialogue with the pilgrim is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext. The final beat's rhythm modulates appropriately—simple syntax mirroring the act—but earlier blocks carry uniform stem patterns ("I [verb]... I [verb]") that flatten momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric-compressed: "chimes tinkling like oysters speaking in coded clicks," "a gull pretends to be a thought." POV remains stable in first person, and psychic distance is controlled. The compression is purposeful and taught early ("questions like lanterns, hooded"), paying off in the final image. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("what I am really selling"). One deduction: the phrase "sincerely insincere" appears identically in the opening job description and the closing beat, which risks template feel rather than earned reprise, though the second use is dramatized through the handshake-like nod and the cloak exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The perceptual signature is consistent and lyric: "sycamore hush," "bones hummed," "rings laced." Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing the lesson. However, the register occasionally drifts into ornate phrasing that feels more decorative than character-specific ("chronological husk," "vanishing might let a thing appear true"). Under peak pressure, the voice remains too composed; no compression or ragged urgency appears when the researcher begins to vanish.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"Every note returns bearing grit, a date written as abrasion." The diction remains consistently elevated and character-particular throughout, blending technical vocabulary ("harmonic stone skimmer," "tuning wedge") with lyric compression. No head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("letting my stillness become a door the canyon can graciously swing") that risks losing narrative immediacy under pressure, and some metaphors feel more crafted than organically perceived.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "a broom leans, how a kettle breathes, and how light lingers after light." POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and controlled, with purposeful compression ("mist walking meant trusting weight to moments"). Rhythmic modulation under pressure: short declaratives during the keystone encounter ("I waited, counting my heartbeat") accelerate into longer, breath-like cadences at closure. Minor consideration: a few elevated turns ("accommodates impossibilities") approach the edge of the character's established lexicon but remain voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "Their small suns would climb into the wind like soft-spoken stars with errands" carries consistent metaphoric density and perceptual signature. POV distance remains stable; the narrator's way of noticing is selective (listening for "the sea's color"). No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is present—"the cabinet opened without moving"—and taught through the accumulative pattern. One register drift occurs late: "luminous vows inked with ash-water" in the crowd description echoes the protagonist's interior idiom too closely, though the effect may be intentional mirroring. The lyric density remains high throughout without clear modulation under peak stress, which slightly flattens urgency in the underwater beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: technical ritual details (impedance, antenna arrays, static bursts) filtered through metaphoric compression ("stellar doubt," "warm gravity"). Diction stays consistent—lyric, compressed, concrete—under pressure: "The receiver gasps into song, not forward, but peeling backward, syllables swallowed into consonants, then to breath, then to pulse." Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (many clauses beginning with "I," parallel phrase structures) teach a ritual cadence that supports the accumulative lens. No head-hopping; narrator knowledge stays bounded by what static and coins reveal. Brief elision (how exactly the song transmission works) imposes cost (uncertainty) that pays off in the final "leaning possibility."

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the reaper's metaphors are death-work specific (scythes, ledger of souls, cloak of alleyways). Diction remains stable and voice-particular ("heartbroken reaper," "ribs vibrate when grief leans in"). Psychic distance controlled; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("Small Payments," "Not Leaving") taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short fragments at the final naming, longer sentences for the snowfield memory.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Nera filters the world through her tepid magic and drip-counting ("drops gather on the arch like thoughts," "a living metronome"). Diction—"earnestly naive," "brittle devotion," "wet arithmetic," "lighthouse alphabet"—is consistent, lyric, and voice-specific. Dialogue between Nera and Aro is subtext-driven ("Not a shrine, a song") and goal-oriented. Psychic distance is stable third-limited; no filter clutter or head-hopping. Compression under pressure (bell falters, old rules crumble) supports urgency without losing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "a moth wing of glassless memory," "a tremor," "a shoreline watches a boat." The warden's perceptual signature (kneeling, noticing labels, sensing the chime) feels character-specific. Dialogue carries purpose and subtext ("They belonged to the town, she says, but they were mine to keep"). The final paragraph's self-declaration ("I will keep walking") shifts slightly toward public oath rather than private thought, and "vigilant and open" recycles the opening descriptor, but psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "careless swaying" of blossoms, "flame whisper, not roar," "murmuration...an airborne syntax." The prose reflects her discipline (precise adjustments, labeled vials) and secret sentiment (mother's singing, bruised pears). Psychic distance modulates cleanly from tight focus on the crystal to wider awareness of starlings. One minor slip: "She hated admitting it" feels slightly over-articulated for someone in the midst of ritual, though it remains in character.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "the change in rhythm you ignore until the rhythm ignores you back" and "pride is the cheap spice that ruins concentration" carry voice-specific idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—pulling close during the buckle crisis, widening to arbor-scale at closure. Dialogue ("One strap claps" / "Do not look") feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (Lio's autonomy vs. the narrator's care). Minor slip: Lio's voice could be more distinct from the narrator's internal cadence; brief convergence at relief is acceptable, but earlier differentiation would sharpen. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is highly stylized, with consistent compression and poetic syntax ("a tidal alphabet, uncertain at first and then spelling my breath"). Perceptual signature is strong—Kana notices numbness, balance, pretense—but the register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels imposed rather than character-generated ("sainthood and prison," "coauthor the next day"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Ori's "law without breath becomes a shrine to absence"). The lyric mode is taught early and held, though some readers may find the density obscures immediate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "urgency tastes like rain," "sorrow that makes hair stand even on the sleeping," "pears... tender enough to understand what we had asked of it." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (sensory metaphors, atmospheric precision) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's immediacy: "macerate," "skein," "filament of giggle" read studied rather than lived under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping, and the voice modulates purposefully with ritual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in first person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices edges, pauses, and margins ("looped handwriting that shimmered only at the borders where light admitted defeat"). Dialogue between protagonist and guardian carries subtext—his "sideways animal way" smile and evasive answers about the library's purpose—and advances plot by teaching waiting and the interiorizing method. Diction stays within a lyric-philosophical register ("foggy lucidity," "dimensionally homesick") that matches the dreamlike frame without slipping into generic fantasy. The guardian's speech feels differentiated (clipped, wary: "help begins when people learn to wait without freezing") from the protagonist's more exploratory tone. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know within the dream logic established early.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the alchemist; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature is consistent (wind tasted of iron, embers lifted "as if listening," joy hurt). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which fits the fable-like tone but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("a stoically sensitive stillness that made silence feel seen"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, though "embers braided a quiet spiral" in the opening and "frozen bloom" as both literal flower and tonal motif blur slightly without grounding in physics. The prose texture is distinct and voice-motivated, but the elevated register is unbroken even under high pressure (confrontation with bishop's men), where a tighter, more urgent syntax might sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: "fantasy practicality," "gravity pinches the gorge and widens the air," "a tone that sounded like breath held by a planet." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature (technical + lyric diction). Sela's brief dialogue ("believes the city is alive when it swings") and the mentor's axiom ("clarity is the art of listening to what is not there") carry subtext without exposition. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of descent mechanics, the bucket's return) accelerates to closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates intentionally at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is lyric, maritime-specific, and consistent: "trained by tides and ticket stubs," "pilings that remember more hulls than years." POV distance is stable; internal compression ("counting without numbers") is purposeful and taught. The final paragraph's elevated diction ("tethered to echoes, counting the inhale of the cave") suits the transformation but occasionally drifts toward decorative lyricism that slows momentum. The doubled self's dialogue is clean and goal-driven. No head-hopping; focalization remains with the protagonist throughout. Minor filter-verb density in mid-sections ("I find," "I feel") is acceptable within this contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and controlled: "fog that listens," "arithmetic songs to pigeons," "math was kinder than people." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature filtered through architectural metaphors. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the memory, wider during visitor vignettes. The phrase "realistically imaginary" is used as an in-world term rather than head-hopping. One slip: "erupts" in "whispers erupt" is explained parenthetically ("the word means both burst and emerge"), which breaks voice for meta-commentary. Otherwise, rhythm and diction remain consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: nautical diction ("benthic," "scumble," "trawler," "monorail's western terminus"), filtered-bell atmosphere, and the instructor's careful, patient rhythm. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate at the desk with the chain link, wider when describing the council or the ascent. Inea's whispered star names provide brief dialogue that advances plot and reveals her interior state. The prose occasionally leans into elevated registry ("arithmetic of need," "scale the world") that fits the instructor's voice but risks slight uniformity across emotional beats. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I feel") appear sparingly and remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "contact tracer for hearts," "reeling hush," "kindness of pretending it was their idea first." POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference: "I understand they are steering me"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—"she chose to share her heart with you, not her ending" pursues reassurance with subtext about agency. Distance modulates purposefully from lyric compression ("biology becomes memory") to direct address at peak pressure. Perceptual signature remains character-specific (curiosity, listening, tracking borrowed rhythms). Minor register elevation ("reeling hush," "incidental heroism") fits the narrator's idiom without jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is selective and technical (air currents, cable hum, phase vocabulary). Diction remains within Ivo's plausible lexicon—specialist terms (sump, littoral, phase, amplitude) anchor voice without drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during ritual moments (mugs, whispering), pulled back during technical work. Syntax reflects his disciplined, patient stance. One friction: some figurative constructions ("crashing hush," "secret tongue," "pale fish turning") recur across emotional registers without clear escalation, risking ornamental density. No head-hopping, tense is stable, and the compression during peak stress (file index waking) stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is lyric, contemplative, and consistent ("the dome breathes," "a shadow stitched from clerks"). Distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping. The ghost's dialogue ("Remember me as something more than interference") reads more like thematic utterance than character-specific speech, slightly flattening voice distinction. Interior monologue ("I do not want revenge; I want a wiser ending") veers toward thesis statement rather than embodied perception under pressure. Diction is elevated throughout; peak beats maintain texture without collapse, though the rhythm becomes uniform rather than modulating sharply with stakes. No filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leaks; purposeful compression and metaphor are taught early and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable first-person, and the narrator's perceptual signature (attention to texture, patience, quiet articulation) is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, with metaphoric compression ("a grammar of turns and hesitations whose commas were wings catching silence") that reads voice-motivated and pattern-taught. However, under peak pressure—curse flexing, names surrendering—the register does not modulate; syntax remains ornate and meditative rather than tightening. The prose maintains coherence but sacrifices immediate embodied urgency for sustained textural density. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinctive: compressed lyric syntax ("winter had stitched silence," "fruit roll toward it laughing"), character-specific diction ("do not anthropomorphize rocks"), and purposeful fragments. POV remains stable first-person; psychic distance is consistent. The phone-voice dialogue carries subtext and goal-pressure, though some lines edge toward prompt-echo ("harmony untamed waits for your arrow to become a mouth"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("metamorphose... the joke you clutch") in peak beats, but the arrowhead-pun turn and the narrator's self-aware humor restore ground-level texture. Free indirect handling of the cryptid's speech through the phone is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent perceptual signature (professional musical attention, poetic compression). The narrator's way of noticing is character-specific: "fog stitched ladders of its own," "arbor remembers rain," "dusk, resonantly soft." However, the elevated register holds uniformly across the entire piece without modulation for pressure—peak action beats ("the rails rose") carry the same lyric density as reflective moments, flattening urgency. Some constructions verge on precious ("a hush of brass leaves," "recruiting spider silk and rust alike") and the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism that obscures concrete action. The narrative stance is purposefully compressed and pattern-taught early, making the density legible, but the relentless figurative texture reduces sentence-level propulsion during the central escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: the mailman notices through occupation ("sort the letters by linking absences"), through family inheritance ("my mother, who listened to weather"), and through tactical necessity. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated: "respectfully rebellious," "promises heal," "a thunderstorm in a bottle sealed with wax." Psychic distance modulates with purpose—close during storm release, wider during summary transitions. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. The prose carries a consistent texture in syntax and rhythm: compressed, lyric, specific. Register fits the focalizer's idiom without drift into corporate or academic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third limited, closely aligned with the carpenter's perceptual signature: he "listened to the rails," "traced chalk notes," "held it up to the bells." Diction is lyric and controlled ("luminous piece," "reliquaries," "answer trembled through it"), with consistent register. However, figurative density is high across most sentences without clear pattern-teaching, and several constructions drift toward elevated narration that occasionally distances from the carpenter's embodied experience ("a plan more patient than longing," "showed its work, not as a miracle but as carpentry"). The voice is distinctive but overwritten in places, preventing entry into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable and interior access remains consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct: "equations can dream," "shelves that are lungs," "the library breathes out." Diction stays within the librarian's idiom—scholarly yet tangible. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("observed solitude") and metaphoric density serve the accumulative lens. Minor deduction: occasional elevated constructions ("sanely eccentric archivist," "hyperbolic geometry") risk slight register drift, though they remain plausible for this narrator and the piece teaches its lyric-conceptual voice early enough to earn trust.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and formally controlled; diction ("luminous absence," "vitalize," "prayer-flat rock") coheres with the narrator's odd-hour librarian persona. Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("amplitude of morning," "porous than before") that can obscure immediacy under pressure. The perceptual signature—painterly, archipelago-specific—is distinct. Compression and patterned syntax are taught early and held, satisfying the experimental allowance, though some lines ("the smallest alphabet I have ever held") edge toward stock lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited tracking the locksmith, with clean access to his perceptions ("felt the pull of enveloped secrets") and one brief dip into the scholar's memory ("recognized it as the permission to love"). Distance is largely consistent, though the scholar's interior moment mid-scene creates slight POV leakage. Voice is elevated and lyric throughout ("the bruised blue of distant rain," "oaths that open only when a life admits its longing"), maintaining a distinct texture. However, the register remains uniformly poetic even under peak pressure, without modulation to reflect urgency or stress. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks the compression or rhythmic shift that might heighten closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single first-person POV with stable, profession-inflected perceptual signature: "hands-on folklorist," "empirics of rumor," "tidewriting." Diction is consistently elevated yet concrete, blending technical observation with lyric compression ("kelp and rust script," "anemone apples," "vowels travel slow"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during tactile engagement (touching the ring, sliding hand over film), wider during reflective passages anchored to present stimuli (checking the watch, humming the song). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm tightens during the step-through sequence and loosens in the coda. Sentence variety and image density remain high throughout. Minor consideration: some metaphors approach overwriting ("pollen of faint light," "film spools") but remain legible and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "Dust rose when I breathed, as if even air preferred to be archived before it touched me" and "Combative tenderness is the first language here" establish a perceptual signature anchored in the archivist's self-aware bitterness and pedagogical precision. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority alternates with instructional address to the girl and shadow). The girl's dialogue ("My brother taught me to fall and get up") carries subtext and goal-pursuit, and her shrug at the end ("learning not to bow when the world finally behaves correctly") advances character without filter-verb stacks or exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single first-person POV with stable psychic distance and a lyric register ("shears remembered lullabies," "bees stitched with shadow thread"). Perceptual signature is consistent—everything filtered through pruning metaphor—but voice lacks modulation under pressure; diction remains elevated and poetic even at peak beats. No dialogue, so related bullets are waived. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (repeated "by capturing essence," parallelism in final third) are taught early and legible, qualifying as experimental allowance. Filter verbs ("I touched," "I listened," "I asked") cluster without harm to immediacy given the meditative register.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single first-person POV is stable and the voice is distinct: lyric diction ("kelp and coins," "topographical cloud," "precise unease") with a ritualist's purposeful cadence. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—attending to hush, gravity, silence as material—is consistent. The daughter's brief dialogue ("thank you") feels natural and weighted. However, runs of parallel syntactic structures ("I keep," "I tell," "I place," "I lift," "I press") and elevated register in high-pressure beats ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") risk template cadence and slight distance drift. Filter verbs ("I tell," "I ask") are frequent but voice-motivated, so no major penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I felt the torn curve like a throat withholding a name," "stones like worn teeth in a careful mouth," "a rusted handle hid under lichens, the shape of a tongue dried mid word." Vocabulary remains consistently craft-specific and metaphorically grounded in embodied observation. POV distance is stable; focalization never leaks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the panel investigation, slightly elevated in the final restoration beat to allow thematic resonance without didacticism. Compression in peak moments (video comparison, panel opening) maintains voice texture. Minor slip: "because my reason for this work has always been to interpret silence with empathy" edges toward articulated mission statement rather than dramatized stance, though the surrounding beats recover through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistently lyric-analytic with a distinct perceptual signature: "books lay spined like fish," "mussel shells," "the pattern in the noise leaned like a shadow leaning again." POV distance remains stable first-person throughout; no head-hopping. Malik's radio presence provides minimal dialogue that serves function without requiring full characterization. Diction remains within the narrator's register—technical (splice, reels, heads) blended with metaphoric compression (ledger, shrine, tomb)—and modulates under pressure: shorter bursts during the tape playback, longer syntactic arcs during reflection. One minor filter-verb cluster ("I could almost taste the ink that was not there") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the beat. Purposeful elision (the descent, the initial Earhart discovery) is taught early and paid off when the frame recurs.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "tinkersong wonder," "parliament of whispers," "circuits the ghost can taste" establish a lyric-technical idiom that remains stable under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory detail filtered through craft priorities (ozone crackle, static grounding, cadmium pigment). Purposeful compression ("sky resets the world, in that bright gap no clock can hold") and patterned parallelism ("breaths...tendons...doors") are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during encoding, wider during ghost manifestation). Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within the balladeer's plausible lexicon (mix of technical craft terms and poetic metaphor). The single-line paragraphs create visual rhythm that supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV distance is stable and precise throughout; first-person singular with controlled access to the narrator's perception and no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric-textured syntax ("guilty tremor a string feels when plucked by a ghost"), metaphor density that never muddles sense, diction that balances elevated register with concrete anchors. Perceptual signature is character-specific—the servant notices structural details (cage, ribs, cables) and emotional weather through analogy to service tools (lantern, maps). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tightest in peak beats (goggles on, letters rising), pulling back slightly for reflective synthesis ("I loved her, I think"). Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or tense drift. The prose's rhythm accelerates through the climb and breathes at closure ("letters finally settle into sleep").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: meteorological filter shapes every observation (cirrus as wistful, cumulus as stubborn, wake as "melancholic cumulonimbus"). Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early ("quietly explosive," "negative monument") and paid off at closure. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("parenting hail it never intends to drop," "half-life by the persistence of eddies") approaches ornamentation in mid-beats, though voice-motivated and legible. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I never remember who has eyes like rain; I remember the way ceilings breathe." Diction remains elevated and rhythmic ("dust drifts like pollen," "graphite dust blooms like night") but coheres as the artist's interior lexicon under contemplative pressure. No dialogue; single POV with stable focalization. Psychic distance is close and consistent. Minor rhythm risk: several sentence stems open with "I [verb]" in succession mid-piece, but the cadence modulates enough to avoid template monotony. Free indirect thought is clean; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I answer the beams under my breath," "the way each tone scratches the ribs of the hull." Diction is consistently lyric-specific ("cursive," "skipped stone," "tea into a cracked cup"). Melora's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("our shadow looks like a skipped stone"). However, figurative density is high and constant (nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile), and some vehicles strain coherence: light as "silk on a nail" versus "a promise that wants to be kept" versus "tea into a cracked cup." The compression is purposeful and pattern-taught, but peak beats (the net capture) could breathe for clarity without losing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric diction ("driftwood nostalgia," "buoy in cloud tides," "commas" as punctuation for time), purposeful compression, and a perceptual signature that notices maritime and clockwork metaphors throughout. No dialogue is present; interiority is filtered through poetic register that matches the elevated concept. Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. However, some formulations verge on ornamental ("the unhurried knowledge he had come seeking") and syntactic variety could be tighter—many sentences open with subject-verb or "He [verb]" patterns under pressure, creating mild template cadence in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective focalization with no head-hopping into individuated interiorities; Ana's segment and the narrator's kneeling to read Vine's message are handled as shared witness. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "brambled hope," "voices braid like vines," "unbuttoned" sky. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, though the elevated register ("woolen body of vapor," "throat we had not known it possessed") never degrades under stress. Psychic distance is controlled, but the lack of friction or perceptual shift across the relay flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and syntactically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "bruised awe," "pane of hush," "the sea combing its own memory"). Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflection, and the diction fits the contemplative, ritualistic stance. However, several figurative constructions in peak beats blur clarity: "quiet fire," "warm tide washing the mechanism clean," "time made gentle" stack without sharp embodiment. The prose leans toward pattern-taught lyricism, but the density of metaphor in the climactic sequence (lines 34–39) occasionally flattens immediacy rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and stable: "reluctant as a door reluctant to open on a winter morning," "graceless beauty…all beaks and angles." Diction remains orchard-specific and sensory under pressure. Dialogue ("Follow the turn where the olives taste of iron") carries goal and subtext. Distance is controlled—first-person interiority modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks; purposeful compression ("I spoke of it to travelers offhandedly exact") matches voice. The told truth versus "deeper truth" layering shows psychic distance shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; perceptual signature (symphonic listening, molecular metaphor) is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext: "maybe we both shed something" and the brother's silence until evening. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("symphonically minded," "translating separation into connection") but remains within a chemist-narrator's idiom under the accumulative lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during apology, wider during ravine observation). Purposeful compression ("they argued…he had left town, leaving a silence") efficiently anchors backstory without stalling. Minor: "teeter" and "afterquiet" are slightly precious but defensible as voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("glass fruit heavy with unread sugar," "cold grammar"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the incision beats. However, purposeful compression and fragmentation ("I was mindfully scattered, inventorying the hush") occasionally slip into opacity—"mindfully scattered" reads as decorative rather than a perceptual signature that shapes what the vendor notices. The customer's dialogue ("she said she had been on parole") is clean and advances plot, but the narrator's explanatory asides ("Parole as in promise...") reduce subtext. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and clean, with a distinctive perceptual signature rooted in the chef's synesthetic gift: "my tongue already ached," "my mouth began to flood," tasting siege and truce. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"sorrow climbed my skin like ivy seeking eaves," "debt are plural"—with purposeful compression and elevated register that remains consistent. The chef's attention hierarchy (culinary, tactile, memorial) filters all detail. One minor slip: "sturdy brittle music" and "hoarfrosted" risk slight overwriting in the opening, though they serve atmospheric setup and the voice recovers momentum quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV (Mara) holds throughout with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature—"voices shelved like constellations," "fear tasted like hulls"—is character-specific. No head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("purpose that matched her pulse," "liturgy for timber, iron, and seed") that strains against immediate embodiment. The grain elevator's dialogue ("Hola…salut…ciao") and Mara's multilingual scales are purposeful but risk slipping into ornament when not anchored in micro-choice. Distance and tense remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV remains stable in first-person present tense with controlled psychic distance and a distinct engineer's perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "coil chaos into circuits"). Diction occasionally slips into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-voiced: "quaking reverie," "synaptic plasticity," "limestone of unsent emails" read precise but not always consonant with mid-crisis thought. The reflection-heavy structure keeps the piece in contemplative mode throughout, which fits the ritual frame but flattens sentence-level propulsion. Purposeful compression in lines like "sweet and cracked, into a map that would reveal what held us" maintains coherence, though some constructions ("the whisper of circuits arranging themselves through synaptic plasticity rather than brute force") border on expository.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV throughout with a distinct lyric register: "the hour the world would turn itself upside down," "borders between stone and sky rearrange the rules." Perceptual signature is consistent—archivist's attention to margins, grooves, tones. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("prism-minded," "threshold effects") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess. The piece teaches its compression pattern early (elliptical, image-dense) and sustains it, though some filter constructions ("I could only enter," "I would learn") dull immediacy in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "fingertip to letter to breath," "small letters," "as if mending fabric." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; elevated phrasing ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") reads consistent with the sculptor's training and post-siren world. Purposeful compression ("the river gathering its coat and pretending that movement is not confession") is taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows; inference reads as inference ("deciding the hour for bustling"). Minor density in figurative language ("room made of leaves," "porcelain ear," "hollow log body double") stays within the sculptor's idiom and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single tight third-person POV anchored in the tutor's perceptual signature: "cold iron railing humming like a velvet throat," "worry stone dent, a small harbor where my nerves had previously docked." Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("salted with snowmotes," "tariffs," "catalogues of wind in ivy"). Distance modulates purposefully—close in the basalt passage, wider when narrating the guard's doctrine. The student remains exterior but legible through gesture (hood, nod, queen move, stillness as refusal). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts serve pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and consistent: lyric, self-aware, theatrical ("because I am alone and the lamp likes applause"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the elevated register—"I am an eclectic pacifist," "a communion measured in almosts," "a choir of broken clocks"—is relentless, and the prose rarely modulates under pressure; even peak moments (the clasp opening) maintain the same ornate diction. The perceptual signature is singular but risks monotony; syntactic variety exists, yet the rhythmic density remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (olfactory focus, herbalist lexicon). Voice carries distinct texture through purposeful compression ("matte as ash and light as a lie") and rhythmic control. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with immediate scene pressure ("cathedral of odor," "tide's thought"), and some metaphoric constructions risk opacity ("turning of the tide's thought" appears twice without clear anchoring). The piece teaches its lyric register early and maintains it, but the patterned abstraction slightly dulls urgency in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with consistent perceptual signature: "whirling silence," "hollow as gourds," "echoes dart...stitching little ladders of sound." POV remains stable (first-person singular, present-tense launch framed by past reflection). The prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the repair ("I open my pocket and the broken arrow tip leaps"), longer rhythmic swells during the flight. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction: a few lines approach decorative density ("drips crawl upward along my arms like silver insects") without full integration into immediate choice, though they remain voice-coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: forensic precision filtered through professional caution and salt-stained exactitude. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("hazy precision," "buildings that breathe like narrow lungs," "little horizon"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure—calm documentation accelerates into the crew's fatal moment, then returns to measured closure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. The patch "sits like a dial telling me which questions to ask" exemplifies the narrator's way of seeing: objects as instruments, evidence as compass. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is single and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in synesthesia: "every tone as bloom and every color as held breath." Diction is elevated and lyric-compressed ("frostfare waited on my breath"), consistent with the narrator's role but occasionally slipping into register mismatch ("field test, a moment of origin, and a witness willing to stake a life" reads corporate-bureaucratic). No head-hopping, and the narrator's uncertainty is purposeful ("The sculptor did not know me, but I knew her pulse"). Free indirect style is clean when filtering the sculptor's state, yet the piece's compression flattens some micro-choices into summary. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final lines drift into meta-commentary ("I would say...") that asserts rather than enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    First-person POV distance is stable and apt; the protagonist's perceptual signature (filtering landscape through failure and ceremony) is consistent. Diction is purposeful and lyric without obscuring clarity: "avalanchingly quiet," "braid of lines marks the old art," "not pardon, it is practice." Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the flute-playing beat when the valley "offers a corridor" and the twin-self appears, creating a productive ambiguity about whether this is literal or interior. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: some figurative clusters in the final third ("hunger to patience," "slow braid tying hunger to patience") repeat the same vehicle, creating slight template cadence, but the effect remains voice-motivated and does not obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person singular POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is lyric and metaphor-dense ("night hinged like a press bed," "lucid turbulence"), creating a distinct texture. However, the elevated register is consistent throughout—no modulation under peak pressure, which flattens the sense of escalation. Dialogue is minimal and effective ("Hold this… count the gap"). The piece teaches its compression pattern early, so the density is acceptable under the experimental allowance. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("derivative at that moment," "function from longing to relief") that reads as external vocabulary rather than the narrator's idiom under stress, costing eligibility for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: the courier notices tremors, vibrations, germination, and the ridge's angles through a lens of attentive wonder. Diction remains stable within the focalizer's lyric-philosophical register ("veil of green silk torn into ribbons," "small names germinate") with purposeful compression that the piece teaches early. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The woman's brief dialogue ("she tells me her village slid downhill...with forgetting") carries subtext and advances plot. Psychic distance modulates intentionally—closer during the pendant's work, stepping back for reflection—without filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "I speak to him aloud, saying I know why you left" shifts into direct address mid-thought without clear dramatized prompt, though the effect supports the established pattern of carrying the mentor's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors lean toward architecture and breath ("ballast," "chapel in fog," "frantic ferns"). Diction stays consistent—"patient witness," "dignitary...waiting under glass"—and modulates under pressure without breaking voice. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Mara's lines ("Tell it what it wants to be called") advance ritual stakes. Minor: one phrase, "refusing to leap to meanings before they earn trust," tilts slightly expository, though it recovers quickly. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at the father's name and relaxes at the mist-exit.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable and lyric; the spinner's perceptual signature (listening for threads the living cannot hear, combing burrs from wool) is consistent and specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching the loom-spinner idiom. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear but fit the reflective, accumulative texture without dulling immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping. Minor slip: some metaphoric intensifiers ("stoically sparkling" recurs three times) edge toward decorative repetition rather than dynamic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person; perceptual signature is consistent (blacksmith-filtered: iron, nails, grooves, dovetails, cogs). Diction is purposeful and poetic without obscuring clarity: "rubble that clattered around the notion of being useless," "truth is I was quietly determined, and the arches had heard that truth in every blow I once held back." Psychic distance modulates appropriately under stress (tremor narrows focus to wall, breathing, counting). Minor slip: a few lines approach elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds the grounded blacksmith idiom established elsewhere ("apples ripened with anxious blushes," "court of whispers"), creating brief register drift without breaking voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric, compressed syntax ("Every cycle, my leaps come unbidden, cyclically spontaneous as if time itself breathes in patterns") with sensory diction that reflects the protagonist's profession. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and held. Filter verbs ("I feel," "I taste") appear frequently but read as voice-motivated occupational habit rather than opacity. The piece teaches its pattern—sensory metaphor, parallel-universe shifts—and pays it off at closure. Perceptual signature (taste, smell, vibration) is selective and character-specific, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q6.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "I read the water, the gulls, the seams on a fuel drum." Focalization is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—maritime, reticent, observant—under pressure: "I was the shape of silence a room makes when two men fail to say goodbye." Purposeful compression ("barrels and bread, a wrench, a story") and lyric patterning ("They say lights die like people") are taught early and sustained. The final ritual unfolds through concrete action verbs (unscrewed, poured, pressed, sealed) that anchor reflection. Free indirect narration of the letter-writers ("to bottle the feeling of safety") remains clean. Psychic distance modulates intentionally from close observation to quiet summary.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "storms are like readers, impatient until the first line hooks them." Purposeful compression and lyric diction are taught early and sustained; the elevated register matches the protagonist's mythopoetic frame without jarring. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: a few lines ("I do not panic"; "We do not drown; we drink") verge on summary-tell where embodied action would sharpen immediacy, costing a step into the 8.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable first-person with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: post-transplant hyperawareness of pulse, rhythm, borrowed grief. Diction stays within the protagonist's contemplative register; the dye master's speech carries a different cadence ("Work ends where a listener might begin"). One brief filter-verb cluster in the middle third ("I could feel," "I thought of") but voice remains coherent under pressure. The final paragraph's compression ("the heart answered") is purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("mundane miracles," "quantified sorrow," "interior weather") paired with concrete particulars (mops, maps, envelopes, twig). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature—maintenance worker meeting astronomer's tools, moonlight as ledger—shapes every detail. Patterned diction and deliberate elision (e.g., "the numbers gentled into stories") are taught early and serve closure. Minor register drift in phrases like "conceptual repricing" is voice-motivated and fits the narrator's method of quantifying sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The first-person voice is stable and carries a distinct perceptual signature: alchemical-craft diction ("lamina," "hoarfrost unbuttoning," "warping vine to vine") filtered through the keeper's embodied work. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure: shorter clauses during the village arrival ("I open the doors and smell old seaweed and gun oil"), expansive syntax during the weaving climax. Some figurative density ("a murmuration of sparks stitching hearth to hearth") risks slight overwriting in the final third, but the voice remains character-specific and the final image coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, with a lyric compression ("the city exhaled a slow hush," "linted moons") and a perceptual signature tied to Mara's craft ("backward spine," "book...sewn"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the woman's lines carry subtext and advance plot without exposition. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts above Mara's plausible lexicon ("enlarged tranquility," "braided tether"), creating minor register friction in peak beats. The woman's speech converges slightly with the narrative voice, but remains legible as a separate character.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and voice-motivated: "creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle," the rhythm of "Snip, lift, thank, return." POV distance is stable; psychic reach stays within the narrator's knowledge. Diction is controlled and apt. Two deductions: (1) occasional elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "guerrilla gardening") sits uneasily against the lyric texture in peak beats, and (2) dialogue is absent, so subtext and character distinction through speech cannot be evaluated. Free indirect passages are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person; psychic distance contracts under pressure ("I whispered, No trace to bind") and expands in reflective beats without head-hopping. Diction is lyric and consistent ("patience of the gale," "shy aurora," "beekeeper… arranging hexagons of data"), matching the narrator's voice throughout. Perception is character-particular: "the dome sometimes answered with a low glow" reflects the narrator's attentiveness to the library's responses. No dialogue appears; the piece sustains a singular narrative texture. Purposeful compression ("we marked it for archive, and a tiny fleck of warmth moved through the room") and figurative density fit the voice and taught pattern, legible at closure. Filter verbs ("I thought," "I wondered") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "nerves were ropes tarred and tight," "his mask held, but the pier groaned disagreeably." Diction is consistent and voice-particular. The sign-language negotiation avoids dialogue but maintains character distinction through gesture and reaction. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" recurs four times as a tag rather than embodied texture, and "comforting unease" in the opening edges toward abstraction. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: short declaratives tighten as the belt buckles, then lengthen as she walks the shoreline.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lush and consistent—"terrestrially cosmic river," "granulated sugar sticking to my tongue"—but the diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("emergent compass," "futuristic nostalgia") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. Naira's dialogue ("Weather is memory and duty") carries subtext and advances understanding. POV distance is stable; the narrator's taste-based perception is selective and singular. However, the prose sometimes substitutes metaphor density for clarity in peak beats (e.g., "emergent compass … arranging direction from countless tiny pulls"), and the final paragraph's articulation of the method feels more like a thesis statement than dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is distinct and lyric ("auroral sorrow glows on every shard of quartz," "calling draws us the way water finds its level"), with perceptual signature tied to the artist's training (geometry, angles, graphite maps). POV remains stable first-person throughout. Some diction choices feel elevated beyond immediate crisis urgency ("rectify the axle in my hand," "mnemonically gifted, cursed to store details") and approach essay register at peak beats, slightly loosening the felt pressure where tighter embodiment would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "the gilding on my cuffs knows how to listen if my heart stays steadier than my breath," "floorboards curled like tongues bitten too long." Psychic distance remains stable, and the narrator's way of noticing is consistently filtered through the calligrapher's craft. Some figurative language approaches density limits in high-pressure beats—"a slow ribbon of mist unspooled, beaded with words"—but stays legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; focalization is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Mara's perceptual filter: "Mara felt the season change inside her; her throat cooled." Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent ("wonder had a hue here, a pale aurora"), though it occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") that reads more thematic than voice-particular. No dialogue appears on the page. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (the aurora, the bells, the fragment) are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor register slips: "seasonally mute when the winds turned and stories curdled" mixes natural metaphor with abstract concept in a way that slightly blurs the grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric—android interiority blends technical precision ("subroutines," "vials," "ions") with organic metaphor ("glass lung," "needle teeth," "river choosing deeper banks"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the android notices systems, patterns, lessons, and thresholds. Syntax modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during breach, longer reflection post-escape). Minor slip: "yellow teeth nibbling paths" and "mothers soothing feverish air" occasionally tip toward decorative figuration, though they remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.6)
    First-person plural ("we") maintains a stable collective stance without head-hopping into individuated interiorities; interior access is consistent. Diction is voice-specific and lyric ("the mouth fills with our own weather while the ears catch seasons," "a click like a teardrop touching wood"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, elevated register in high-pressure beats (e.g., "sandstorm calm," "mosaic," "mutual aid ledger") drifts above the thrift-store curator's plausible lexicon without dramatized justification. Purposeful compression ("Maria woke before dawn, everyone said") and patterned repetition ("the outside world intrudes") are taught early and pay off, yet dialogue is minimal and secondary voices (Mrs. Lin, Javi) lack distinct idiom. Under peak stress the voice remains lyric rather than fragmenting, which reads as authorial rather than POV-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable first-person with a dense, lyric register that remains consistent: "sculling my hands through algae like staves," "arithmetic of fear." The perceptual signature is highly particular—technical (Filter 31, valve pitches) fused with poetic compression—and narration stays within the protagonist's plausible lexicon. Neri's brief dialogue serves as foil but does not fracture voice. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught (coded entries, dance as explanation), though some lines risk opacity: "I encrypt every weakness until it sings" hovers near abstraction without immediate scene anchor. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose modulates with pressure—short declaratives at the climax, longer clauses in reflective beats. Minor penalty for lyric density that occasionally obscures immediate action within high-pressure beats (e.g., "the hymn" reference requires inference).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is strong (flame lean, coffee grounds, crystal facets as minnows under glass). Diction is lyric and controlled—"gleaming silence, salted with everything the town cannot carry awake"—and rhythm modulates with the beats (short sentences at the cube's sweating, longer cadences in the chamber). The woman's disembodied voice ("memories do not die, they migrate") is brief and does not constitute head-hopping; it reads as echo within the cube's moment. No filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and elevated with controlled rhythm and lexical specificity (chirred, sibilants, crosshatched, cauterized). Perceptual signature is poetic but consistent. However, the register remains uniformly high throughout—no modulation under pressure, and the diction (e.g., "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") risks sounding essayistic rather than embodied in the summoner's mind. The prose reads as narrated *about* the character rather than filtered *through* lived experience, limiting intimacy and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-POV narration with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator thinks in bookish conceits (garden breathes like a library, steam as typesetting, basil as encyclopedia) that remain consistent under pressure. Diction stays within an erudite register without drift; metaphors drawn from texts and architecture cohere with the narrator's stated goal to learn building-language. The tutor's indirect speech ("Do not rush...the past prefers patience") contrasts purposefully with the narrator's image-dense reflection. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during seal-handling, wider during meteor observations. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is職業-specific ("archive those vibrations," "resonance structures") and poetic ("paper gull," "each leaf a tongue"). Diction sustains a heightened, incantatory register ("soundless words that shiver the marrows of flowers") that fits the narrator's archival role and the garden's enchantment. Minor slips: some metaphoric density approaches self-consciousness ("fanged around tenderness withheld") and a few filter verbs ("I tell her") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; the laugh's "answer" reads as perceived resonance, not true access to Reina's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and purposeful, with a controlled lyric register ("pearl twilight pooled," "aurora combed green fire"). POV remains stable in first person with no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("stalactites sharpened the silence into slow needles," "vowstone," "heritage rose thorn") pervades nearly every sentence, creating density that occasionally slows momentum in high-pressure beats. The perceptual signature is consistent but the register does not modulate meaningfully with urgency. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature ("hearing grief in crevices," "a reed-blown melancholy"). The prose sustains an elevated, mythic register throughout, and the focalizer's certainty matches the role of a trained canyon singer. However, psychic distance occasionally tightens without motivation—"being richly perceptive, I tuned my next note to that tremor"—reading as self-annotation rather than dramatized perception under pressure. The council members' speech is compressed into indirect summary ("the tallest said") rather than on-page dialogue with subtext or goal pursuit, flattening what could have been a charged exchange. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the single-POV frame holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable; the first-person narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and voice-specific ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer," "ghosts prefer threads to nets"). Diction remains within the narrator's professional idiom, blending investigative precision with lyric compression. The prose modulates with pressure: early exposition is measured, the shrine encounter tightens to image-dense beats, and the closing lines lengthen into declarative resolve. One purposeful elision: the mechanics of how dreams transmit are compressed, but the pattern is taught early and pays off when the shrine's ice-windows manifest the dreamers' faces. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with the philosopher as anchor; perceptual signature is consistent (hidden patterns, moon paths, foam gyres). Diction is elevated and lyric ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") but remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout. Dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext (Li's hunger-driven urgency, the widow's quiet apology). Minor slip: the widow's brief line "I cut where the river knots drown the slow ones" is slightly over-articulate for the moment's stress, though it remains within character. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single first-person POV remains stable and confident throughout. Voice is distinct: "miracles make me itch," "sharply observant... a label pasted on me by editors who prefer personality to patience." Perceptual signature is consistent (professional skepticism filtering every detail). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Klay's evasive explanations and the narrator's direct questions create subtext around the cover-up. Brief register elevation in technical passages ("Stillwater Remediation," "microclimates around collapsed reactors") fits the narrator's investigative expertise. One small slip: "the body believes it" in the stillness explanation reads slightly abstract for the otherwise grounded voice, but it's a hairline deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, distinct, and controlled: lyric compression, purposeful archaism ("gritty whimsy," "lyrically prophetic"), and a perceptual signature that filters the world through broadcast metaphors. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Diction stays within the narrator's register (conductor/prophet hybrid) and syntactic variety supports the textural drive. The piece teaches its pattern early (compressed, imagistic syntax) and maintains it through closure. Elision of transitional mechanics (how the crowd chooses, how Kestrel grows tall) is consistent with the lyric mode and does not obscure the dominant lens or closure effect, justifying high placement.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and consistent—lyric compression, poetic register, purposeful syntactic inversion ("It is a lonesome splendor to work alone"), and a perceptual signature filtered through sound and memory. Diction remains character-particular ("salt-stung quiet," "feral loft," "crooked essay across the dunes"). The compressed, metaphor-dense style is taught early and sustained, fitting the poet's vocation. However, under peak emotional pressure (the storm reflection on his mother, the widow's tears), the narrator's articulate philosophical cadence does not degrade or compress, maintaining the same polished register throughout. This consistency is voice-motivated but reduces the sense of stress modulation. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction for uniform syntactic elegance that does not shift with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature distinct (lighthouse-engineer diction: "brass heartbeat," "vibrational matching," "narrative clock"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("I call it a cure that sells" / "it is not for sale"). Distance control is consistent, though brief filter-verb clusters ("I felt," "I told him") slightly dull immediacy in two mid-scene beats. Purposeful compression in the hum sequence ("adapt to the sorrow without swallowing it") is voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; internal voice coheres under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person POV is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct—metaphors of cartography, sculpture, tide—rooted in the narrator's role. Diction remains consistent (restrained wildness, "dream drunk," "chalk arcs laid over the lake") and elevated without breaking character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the demonstration, wider during the post-adoption summary. One slip: the final third shifts into lyric summary mode ("Children learn the moons like songs, and elders feel tendon and breath cease their feuds"), which risks losing the narrator's embodied present and reads more like retrospective narration than lived scene. The compression is purposeful but flattens immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "watchfully calm," "fortified vulnerability," and "armor that can still hear the small sounds of mercy" establish a precise perceptual signature. POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. The piece uses purposeful compression and lyric rhythms (e.g., "every smear, every angle of torque on a stripped bolt") that teach the investigative cadence early and sustain it. Diction stays within the investigator's professional-contemplative register; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Distance modulates appropriately under pressure (the final paragraph's shift to ancestor-inflected resolve feels earned). The narrative withholds nothing the POV knows; elision serves accumulation rather than false suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: chaplain's lens filters through moral calculus ("mercy is not earned, but we still must deserve trust") and liturgical rhythm. Diction remains consistent—"aptly deliberate," "vibrant hush"—though these phrases repeat without evolving tension. Mara's voice is less developed; her speech carries thematic weight but minimal idiolect. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance is stable. Minor register drift: "proceeds would go to support counseling" reads slightly administrative for a reflective beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is singular, rhythmically controlled, and voice-consistent: "merrily allergic to common sense," "sea licks the rafters," "a mirror that keeps sneezing until it learns the shape of light." Free-indirect interiority stays clean; perceptual signature (mechanical metaphors, defiant irreverence) is character-specific. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained; non-standard grammar ("transliterate again, through the images") is voice-motivated and legible. Minor: some figurative density in high-pressure beats (bell rearing, solvents arranging into alphabet) borders on ornamental but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "brightly attentive," "sensed absence sitting beside that feed," "the shape a body makes after it rises." Perceptual signature is selective and职业-specific (metadata, rack rows, "candlelight permissions"). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction stays within the narrator's technical-lyric register throughout. Rhythmic modulation under pressure is evident: clipped urgency during descent ("My badge trembles at each door") versus the hushed final paragraphs. Purposeful compression ("deletion was dispersion, a tidy myth") is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person with stable psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature: "I was calmly intuitive, but intuition needed a device to make itself legible to strangers." Diction remains character-particular ("ankle deep in slush," "weighted breath before reply") and modulates under pressure without register drift. Dialogue is goal-driven and advances plot—envoys' promises are specific, actionable, and subtext-laden (lingering afterward, bowing to orchard not peacekeeper). Minor tic: "I asked" recurs three times in the final third, creating slight template cadence, but does not obscure voice under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and perceptually distinct: "wind testing each rib of the docks like a breath practicing how to stay," "confetti" splinters, "talky boards." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflection anchored to present sensory cues. Mikko's brief dialogue ("Endings announce themselves like weather") contrasts the narrator's interior cadence without leaking register. One tension: the density of figurative language is high throughout, yet it remains legible and voice-consistent, reading as the narrator's way of processing rather than ornament. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person POV is stable, and the perceptual signature is distinct (wine-craft diction, metaphor rooted in viticulture: "churn that makes flavor," "question keeps the gate"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from the opening night-walk to the intimate table exchange, and the sentinel's knowledge remains character-bound (no omniscience about the partner's side). The traveler's dialogue carries goal-pursuit subtext ("hoards silence like coins"), and the phone-loop choreography (speaking, pausing, stepping) externalizes internal shift without exposition. Register is consistent—lyric but not overwrought—though a few constructions edge toward elevated diction ("intersubjective understanding," "adjudicate the night") that test the voice's organic quality under pressure. Free indirect handling of the traveler's confession is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains a distinct lyric-philosophical register with controlled cadence: "the dunes hummed like glass ribs," "memory required a shape, and shape required a walker who listened sideways." Perceptual signature is selective—narrator notices tensions, pulses, the prophet's cedar-and-iron taste—but distance occasionally drifts into expository omniscience ("People came… their steps careful") without dramatized observation. Lio's dialogue carries purpose ("never a cage, only a breathing architecture") and her speech feels distinct from the narrator's interiority. Filter verbs and conceptual abstractions ("the echo we had preserved, not words exactly, but their weather") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. The final dream sequence maintains voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: "subtle puzzle archivist," "earnest whimsy," and "grief dislikes sudden brightness" establish a consistent perceptual signature. Diction remains within the narrator's register (professional but warm) and modulates under pressure without breaking. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext and advances plot (Ole's "why we were making garlands from sorrow" receives a thematic reply that also hands him agency). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable. Minor tic: some metaphors are elevated but remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-close; distance modulates purposefully (tight on interiority, looser for custodians' arrival). Perceptual signature is distinct: "sonically reflective," "grammar of growth," "seedlings of sound" reveal a scholar's idiom. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure; the custody scene compresses without shifting register. Minor deduction: some ornamental phrasing ("weathered innocence," "suspended hush thrumming with intent") decorates more than it constrains. Dialogue is absent; no head-hopping. Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-particular: "precognitively forgetful" modulates diction toward elliptical certainty ("memory was always already gone, like footprints before tide"). Perceptual signature is selective and biased—he hears "tomorrow forgetting him" and tastes salt that "maybe" came from old tears. Purposeful compression ("a space like an ear, big enough to sit inside") and lyric patterning ("do not rewind yet") are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices machines "like stories" and filters the observatory through metaphors of breath, gravity, and afternoons. Diction remains character-specific ("sage not for years, but because I listen") and modulates under pressure without register drift. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Some figurative language in peak beats (comet's shadow "comb[ing] the exosphere") leans decorative, but voice remains internally coherent and the compression serves the lyric mode taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("I hymn the zipper, hymn the knuckle"). Narrative certainty matches what the narrator can know. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Sister, I am here, and I am not leaving this time"). Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure (short declaratives at the chord-stopping beat). Minor deduction for occasional elevated register ("pulsing stillness," "radiant haven") that trends slightly above the narrator's established voice in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision layered with poetic compression ("spoons bend reality," "buoyant night," "patience has teeth"). Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's lexicon—runes, orbits, calibration—fits the role. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure, though phrases like "my patience has teeth" and "shortest circle" flirt with aphorism. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythmic control supports the ritual cadence without algorithmic repetition. Dialogue is absent, appropriately so for solitary ritual work.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is lyric and distinctive, with elevated diction ("shrewdly innocent," "cleft in certainty," "country tale's wound") that reads intentional rather than affected. The narrator's perceptual signature—filtering events through bone-setting and balancing skepticism with kindness—remains consistent. Free indirect access to Mara and the boy is minimal; their speech is indirect summary rather than quoted dialogue. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I saw," "I felt") appear in the middle passage but do not dull immediacy. The prose stays within the narrator's lexicon, though a few constructions edge toward self-conscious lyricism ("rustles argue with breeze").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the tide taught me to listen sideways, to read sky from water." Diction is purposefully elevated ("zephyr bloom of patience," "a word, and we were pronouncing it carefully") and consistent with the reflective, poetic stance. Compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained. No head-hopping. Under peak pressure (the pearl choice), the voice remains coherent though the narrative elides the decision process itself. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's knowledge of community response is plausibly observational.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: the narrator notices patterns (drip seams, data lanes, moss breath) through a watchful-dreamer lens. Diction remains within the narrator's lyric-reflective register; no unmotivated shifts into corporate or academic voice. The dialogue between narrator and Miri is naturalistic and goal-driven, advancing the work without exposition dumps; Miri's brief lines ("the past might want company if we are kind and precise") carry subtext and match her patient-green presence. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("more confessions, more harvests, more days when sweetness hurts") accelerates cadence without losing clarity. Minor slip: "protected vulnerability" as tone descriptor edges toward therapy-speak in one interior line, though it is immediately grounded in the careful rhythm of their conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and sustained: "pages breathed like fog," "river that ran beneath sentences," "wolves of ink padded the margins." POV distance remains stable in first-person singular with no head-hopping; the narrator's perceptual signature (lucidly watchful, attuned to currents and shapes) filters all imagery. Dialogue carries subtext—the girl's accusation, the fisherman's laugh "I had never allowed him"—and advances theme without on-the-nose exposition. Diction occasionally tilts into elevated register ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo appearances") that risks breaking the intimate voice, but the lexicon coheres as a novelist's idiom. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short declaratives at "I knelt," longer spirals in reflection) without syntactic monotony. Filter verbs ("felt the hush swirl," "could not promise") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV holds a stable third-person collective observational stance with close access to Lio's actions but minimal individuated interiority. Diction is lyric and consistent: "breath braided into quiet," "moon sank a finger width," "birds stitched words into the air." The perceptual signature—poetic compression, nature-as-syntax metaphors—remains coherent under pressure. Free indirect touches are clean. However, the voice flattens distinctions: Lio, the elders, and the villagers share the same elevated register without idiomatic variation. Purposeful compression and patterned parallelism ("He spoke...He sang...He paused") teach a ritual cadence that pays off at closure, qualifying under the experimental tolerance; no head-hopping penalty for collective "we" stance. Register drift into abstraction ("a method of listening that made work into wonder") is minor but present.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register: "flash-paper alchemist," "safekept starlight," "moving stillness." Perceptual signature is consistent—poetic compression, body-as-instrument ("listened with her ear against bark, against her own ribs"). Diction remains cohesive under pressure, though the heightened register occasionally distances the reader from immediate sensation. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression ("Small salvations," "tiny channels with a sewing needle") is legible and voice-motivated, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature ("peripherally focused," "echo-length stand in for seconds the way wind stands in for breath") that reflects the locksmith's idiom. Distance is stable first-person past, and POV modesty holds—inferences are marked as such. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("congruence, a yes that used no vowels," "signed treaty between stone and air") that reads ornamental rather than voice-rooted, especially under the story's working-task pressure. Figurative density pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure, triggering overwriting penalties. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not judged.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person; distance and focalization remain consistent. The perceptual signature is distinct—"shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped"—and the diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, voice-motivated by the weaver's profession. No head-hopping. Rhythmic control is present, with sentence lengths varying purposefully. However, the register occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("the binding was a ribbon that traveled every way at once") without grounding in a sensory anchor, and some figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Overall, voice is coherent and purposeful; minor register slips under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: diction compressed and imagistic ("rust-hued peace like old steel," "thin animal nosing the air"), syntax that braids present craft with past instruction without summary. POV distance is stable; certainty matches what she can know. Psychic modulation works: calm precision during carving, sharper intimacy when memory intrudes ("He laughed like a drum under canvas"). Minor pattern debt: "here and gone" recurs seven times, bordering on mantra; the repetition is purposeful but risks over-cuing the thematic spine.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: "silence has weight," "vows are time's favorite minerals," "regret turn heavy as a dropped wrench." Diction remains specific and voice-motivated throughout. The ghost's speech ("do not restart...you will be swallowed") carries subtext and advances plot. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she realizes the ghost will not sort it") appears mid-pressure but does not flatten immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is distinct—compressed, lyric, with engineering idiom ("load paths and social paths," "head and gradient")—and stays character-particular. POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("exhales its stale air," "maze of intentions engraved into every walkway") that feels slightly authorial rather than Mara's idiom under pressure. The boy's brief dialogue is functional but generic. Sentence openings vary, though some stems repeat ("She touches," "She shows," "She writes").

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable single first-person; perceptual signature (silence as river slowed to ice, tools that measure "flex and breath, not noise") is distinct and character-specific. Diction is elevated and consistent ("excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush"), fitting a scribe's interior lexicon. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained. Minor density issue: some phrases edge toward ornament without additional pressure ("a blue thread from a garment I once wore and outgrew"), and a few filter verbs ("I understood," "I realized") appear in reflective beats, slightly dulling immediacy. No head-hopping; narrative distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval," "the sun writes marginalia"—the narrator filters crisis through a reflective, slightly archaic idiom. POV is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext: "the sun was open" counters the foreman's authority with poetic defiance. Compression is purposeful and taught early: "fate does not stack sandbags only on one side." However, diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure—"jealous archivist," "verdicts"—in ways that feel more authorial than character-urgent. The watchman's voice ("laughed like rope sliding over wood") is texturally distinct but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: philosophical precision ("loops that tighten or slip with meaning"), tactile specificity (fulgurite as "brittle flute," tar bead thumb-sized), and patient cadence. The protagonist's voice modulates under pressure without breaking register. The fisherman's brief dialogue ("I have no time," "Teach me the rest") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor density slip: "syllables of salt and tension spelling oaths" leans ornate but remains voice-consistent. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; elision is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from travel, cartography, and textiles ("rivers in drought, showing ribs of stone," "stitch my map"). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains character-coherent; the narrator's occupation justifies the heightened register. Brief dialogue with Mira and the steward feels natural and advances plot. Purposeful compression ("projecting presence") is taught early and paid off in the galley scene and final stitching, keeping the experimental method legible.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: "I told it how the first engines rose from water tables like lilies, a coronation nobody believed was theft." Diction remains consistent—elevated, lyric, mechanical-pastoral—and rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short, staccato clauses during the hatching, longer cadences in reflection). Purposeful compression ("We had been born from engines, crowned by an absence") and non-standard syntax ("the hush where a newborn should wail, the missing midwife") are pattern-taught and legible. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb stacks ("I understood then," "I could not claim") that dull immediacy in peak beats, and one phrase ("I told it") that repeats across three consecutive lines without functional variation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV with stable psychic distance and a lyric-poetic register ("kelp-drift peace," "throats waiting for new song"). Perceptual signature is consistent—firefighter's eye for sap, scars, and wind seams—though diction occasionally elevates beyond urgent focus ("cambium to cambium," "deceiving no one, expecting nothing but attention") in ways that read voice-motivated rather than register drift. The boy's brief dialogue ("You are the one who stops fires...") and the narrator's replies carry subtext (neither blame nor safety, "truth is a shoreline") and advance plot by forcing articulation of the watch-mercy calculus. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I told him," "I said") are economical and voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "realistically imaginative" and "sidereal patience" feel precise to this narrator's idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("the taste of river water") to wider framing ("around me the square filled with murmurs"). The geese motif recurs with shifted meaning—held, then resuming—charging the final image without head-hopping. Minor deduction for one filter-verb stack in the middle passage ("I wanted to liberate," "I learned it," "I went by following") that slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinctive, lyric, and stable: "grief were pollen to be saved," "numbers becoming weather." Distance remains consistent; the narrator's perceptual signature (sonar, mineral lattices, echo-cartography) is specific and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext ("asks whether I can teach her how to give light gently"). Under peak pressure, diction remains textured but occasionally tilts into elevated abstraction ("choreography of shadows that teaches seedlings to bear brightness without learning pain") that risks distancing the reader from immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "slow of hand and fiercely meditative," noticing "crossings," "hollows," and the greenhouse's "damp lungs." Psychic distance remains stable; free indirect style is clean. Diction—"spectral mentorship," "thundering calm," "unseen figure"—reads purpose-driven and voice-consistent. The grandmother's presence is rendered through "pressed behind my shoulder" and "measured pauses between drops," not head-hopping. One slight register drift: "coordinates" and "articulate" feel fractionally elevated in a few beats but do not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the winder's attention moves through mechanical detail (cap, cavity, shot), carved text, and tidal rhythm. Diction modulates effectively under pressure ("The ridge flashes like a cut"). However, register occasionally lifts into elevated phrasing ("searing reverie," "phosphor," "swallowed secret," "coves at low tide") that sits at the edge of the character's established idiom, particularly in peak beats. Purposeful compression is taught and paid off, so no elision penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable, third-limited on Rowan, with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices moss, pebbles, thimble shadows, and "tender pressure toward one square never reached." Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout—"velveteen gloom," "choirboy precision," "needy knots"—and the narrative distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. One register slip: "aerating it, watering it" in the penultimate beat reads slightly mechanical. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. The voice is lyric but remains legible and internally consistent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator's idiom ("ignorance cartographer," "sustaining transformation," "hollow reed") and selective attention (maps, currents, openings) are consistent and voice-motivated. Diction elevates but remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon—professional, metaphor-rich, patient. The Council's dialogue is minimal and functional ("Show us how") without distinct individual voices, but no head-hopping or POV leakage. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the quill-lift and breathing at the ending. Free indirect style is clean. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sustaining transformation," "sites for civic laboratories") that reads more like conceptual exposition than lived perception under pressure. Rhythm and sentence openings vary; no template cadence. No dialogue subtext to judge beyond the Council's brief exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: spare, lyric syntax with purposeful compression ("Their breath turned to vowels that mapped intervals"). POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction matches a literate, musically trained focalizer without register drift. Purposeful elision (the nature of the famine, the regime's specifics) charges the setting without clarity loss. Dialogue is absent, appropriate for the broadcast's one-way transmission. Minor: some constructions edge toward the poetic at the expense of immediacy ("the air itself remembering"), and a few filter verbs ("she noticed," "she recognized") could sharpen, but they do not dull peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I powder the black until it listens," "the first shape opens like a lid," "the graphite sighs against the paper." Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction remains character-particular (professional artist idiom with poetic compression) and modulates under pressure without losing texture. Soren's dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("He asks if he can take the drawing"), and the narrator's voice carries subtext in every directive ("it belongs inside the broken thing now"). Purposeful elision (what broke them, whether forgiveness landed before or after) is taught early and paid off as the narrator fills "the blanks with shadow and breath." Rhythm heightens at the ash-scattering beat without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is singular and controlled: compressed syntax, anti-sentimental ("agonize without drama"), concrete metaphors rooted in craft and tide, and a perceptual signature that notices sediment layers, rat sleep rhythms, and the city's arguments. Psychic distance remains stable in close first person; internal voice never drifts into therapy-speak or academic register. Diction reflects the narrator's dual identity (tutor-turned-salvager): "sedimentary layers of correction, error, and humility," "small insults against error," "time…bites back." One brief exchange with a child ("why I live in the sewer") is natural and advances theme. Rhythm modulates with pressure: terse declaratives under decision beats, longer accumulative lines during salvage sequences. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; elisions (the children's names, the plague's details) feel purposeful rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("traveled stillness," "moon phases denote darkness that makes stars speak"). Dialogue feels natural and purposeful when it appears (Reza's car-backfire confession, the nurse's response). Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close for interiority, out for the collective moment). One slip: "I felt expectantly resigned again, but now the phrase meant..." reads as slightly over-articulated self-commentary that weakens immediacy, and some figurative language ("thread cast across unlearning hatred like a bridge") tilts poetic but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds stable distance and filters all perception through the chef's culinary vocabulary (silence as seasoning, grief without punctuation, editing paragraphs). Figurative density is high but mostly voice-consistent: "planets braid their long spines," "moonwind," "synapses asked to dance." Kye's dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext, though their voice ("arranging is how I will refuse him") briefly elevates into thematic articulation that risks convergence with the narrator's register. Filter verbs ("I tasted," "I knew") appear frequently but read as purposeful POV anchoring rather than dullness. Diction remains controlled; no unmotivated register shifts. The perceptual signature—everything filtered through taste and culinary metaphor—is distinct and charges pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "speech exited me involuntarily truthful," "words tasted like something sweet a hive might save." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("candid toll keeper," "nectar dusk"). Mara's dialogue carries subtext ("frowns the way an engineer frowns") and her single line of direct speech advances plot. Internal texture remains consistent under pressure; the keeper's reflections anchor in present stimuli (box, matchbox, sky). Minor: "They were excellent at routine but had lost the shimmer that made currents notice them" risks slight register drift into abstract summary, though it recovers quickly with the coil action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "creeping normality noticer," "shard of hush…the heavier half of quiet," "streetlights daydream" create a consistent lyric texture. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Diction is purposeful and specific ("orris holds the ghosts of violets and paper"), though occasional lines ("inadvertently profound, like tides explaining themselves") edge toward self-aware poeticism that slightly undercuts immersion. Psychic distance and perceptual signature (attention to misplacement) are cleanly maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV (first-person statue) with stable focalization and a highly distinctive voice: "incisively kind," "animate lifeless," "tide hears me think like a choir of rust." Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric, consistent with the narrator's nature. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator knows only what telepathy and memory reveal. Perceptual signature is strong—noticing through cracks, touching inscriptions, threading thoughts. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("nuance walked in, neither timid nor loud, but present") that flattens the lived texture. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: a mathematician's idiom (lemma, induction, contradiction, topology of vows) filters every observation, and the compression ("None," "k-th step," "pips and scars") remains voice-motivated and legible. Diction is consistently elevated yet character-specific—"balancedly daring," "the nap," "unending tread"—without register drift. Purposeful compression and patterned recursion (proof structure, dice rolls) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates under pressure: sentences tighten during the rupture moment, then expand into the final theorem. The prose reads as character: syntax reflects the proof-building mind.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Anya's perceptual signature: "vowels traded for bread," "tea cloth," "votive lamps." Distance modulates purposefully between close-third interiority and observational stance during visitor arrivals. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the courier's "surprised his mouth remembered" carries embodied recognition. Diction remains consistent—lyric, specific, slightly elevated—but some figurative density clusters ("moon-tipped brush drank light instead of ink," "moonlight pooled cleanly along its bristles like milk") approach overwriting in the opening third without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature—details filtered through curatorial care ("bas-reliefs," "velvet," "stencils for shadow plays") and metaphors drawn from the museum world ("like a book returning to its shelf"). The narrator's lexicon stays apt: "historically oriented" diction without academic jargon, "lighthouse talks to the dark" metaphor voice-motivated. One minor slip: "rosewater dread from the old apothecary stores" in the opening feels slightly expository for immediate knowledge. Psychic distance remains stable, and the closing cadence ("my heart beating time to the river's terrible metronome") controls rhythm under pressure without template phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    The perceptual signature is distinct and craft-inflected ("necessity edits vanity, and the sea edits lies"), with diction and rhythm controlled under pressure. POV remains stable first-person throughout, and the voice modulates from analytical ("I learned the plan through reverse-engineering") to incantatory ("gulls become sketches, waves become equations"). Some figurative density in peak beats edges toward overwriting ("latent radiance succumbing to order," "island's ribs quieted"), and a few metaphors strain slightly ("dry thunder moving"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with purposeful compression ("fear loves a costume," "only the last trick of fear"). Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist notices luminance, costume details, metallic tastes, and carnival detritus in character-specific ways. POV remains stable in first person; psychic distance modulates with pressure (close during confession, slightly pulled back during the advisor's dissolution). Diction occasionally edges toward elevated register under stress ("repulsive allure," "mannequin mouth flexed by wires") but remains voice-motivated and legible. The advisor's dialogue carries a distinct cadence ("unbutton, unbosom") that differentiates him. Minor slip: "a whispering advisor kept his mouth near my ear without touching" reads slightly external for a first-person intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, consistent, and rhythmically controlled: "xylophone mallet in hand," "dubbed the sea with timed delays," "a garden of pulses." Perceptual signature is clear (interpreting clouds like bar lines, listening to sap) and remains stable under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("restless euphony," "sketched resonance"), but the effect is voice-motivated and legible, and no elision obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable first-person, distance controlled, perceptual signature consistent: the cartographer notices whorls, strake, pattern languages, showing professional bias. Diction is lyric and compressed but remains legible and voice-motivated: "breath and shell were old friends of wind" reads as the teacher's idiom internalized. Purposeful compression ("They say the expedition did not perish, but was braided into the paths") signals the watchers' answer economically. One hairline slip: "heatless cold" and "ink walking toward the nib" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, but the effect enhances rather than obscures pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, archival texture—"breath chalking the air," "a name flares at him"—that fits the historian frame and modulates under pressure (descent tightens syntax). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Tomas's "You will blister the town" and Mara's "A mask that protects by erasing a worker's death is a mask that steals breath forever" pursue goals and carry subtext. However, Mara's speech occasionally drifts into thesis statement ("by drawing parallels, so the town can see itself from two angles and walk a middle rail"), and the final self-narration ("Fictional Historian Statement… Method, by drawing parallels") breaks immersion to tag the prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single first-person POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the surveyor notices through a professional-archival lens (hairline tremors, seams, joins), filtering sensory detail through preservation priorities. Diction remains elevated yet character-consistent ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence," "drowned rehearsals") without register drift. Two brief reflection blocks (the woman with oranges, the trumpeter at dawn) anchor in present stimuli (opening a seam, moving to another wound) and tilt present stance by validating the method. Lyric compression ("breath and applause, both already half departed") and patterned syntax ("After the drawbridge rises") teach a cadence that the piece sustains. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (S.G.'s identity) pays off when the initials "glow like a signal."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: vocabulary (indexer's "charter," "die," "allotments"), syntax (inverted "Such staring belonged"), and rhythm modulate with pressure (short bursts when testing the stamp, longer accumulative breath when reflecting). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and biased (notices salt-scoring, gnawed brass, angles of fronds). Diction under peak pressure stays character-particular without register drift. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression ("I was a tranquilly perceptive worker when quiet returned") is voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: compressed, lyric syntax, metaphor-dense diction that reflects the protagonist's craft and grief. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought is consistent. Under peak stress (the crane release, the shadow's return) the prose compresses further without losing coherence or voice. No head-hopping. Weakness: a few lines veer toward elevated abstraction ("a theorem here, a bargain of buoyancy between dream recording and release") that feels slightly detached from the embodied voice established earlier. The basilica keeper's dialogue ("Not for permission, but for lift") is spare and functional but does not carry distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable first-person, perceptually filtered through survivor hypervigilance: "I hold the geode crystal to my ear and it becomes a room inside a room." Diction stays consistent—lyric compression ("unused potential pools," "topography of ache and almost") matches the narrator's contemplative remove from raw crisis. Liyun's brief dialogue ("There") and the narrator's muttered "Give it back" feel natural and goal-driven. Purposeful compression ("We hunt not for monsters but for minima") is pattern-taught and legible. Minor slip: occasional elevated register ("perturbation theory," "damping to the edge of instability") risks mismatch, but the technical idiom is anchored to the narrator's role and remains voice-consistent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single first-person POV is stable and distinct: the pilot's voice mixes technical practicality ("jury-rigged from an old ham set") with lyric perception ("twilight blooms with metal," "receiver drinks the sky in tight gulps"). Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("I ask what the passage bought, and the pilgrim smiles as if apology could be a destination"). Perceptual signature is consistent—flight, calibration, translation—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Distance control is clean; the narrator's certainty matches plausible inference. Diction remains coherent even during the climactic calibration sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent and distinct: "tempered regret is the only armor I own," "a sieved hush through the grassed dunes," "the clerk who turned them into one, reducing a forest of futures." POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the closure (the scale becomes legible). Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("amputated three children into two archives and a ghost") risks register drift, though it remains largely voice-motivated and the perceptual signature is selective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices tides, breath, and word-weight. Voice modulates purposefully (calm enumeration → tightening when Daro refuses → quiet resolve at close). Dialogue is goal-driven and carries subtext (Neris naming Daro, Bram promising repairs). Minor deduction: some register edges upward ("choreography of mediator craft") in a way that feels slightly elevated for the voice's established idiom, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person POV is stable and voice is distinct: navigational idiom ("bearing wrong," "marked ships," "muscle-speech of ferries"), metaphor-rich syntax ("wind buttered the water," "gulls stitched errant commas"). Perceptual signature is selective (poles, Polaris, tides). Dialogue—brief and natural—advances the naming ritual without exposition. Minor register drift: "merrily melancholic by habit" and "flickering faith sputter" lean slightly literary-diagnostic for mid-crisis interiority. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the confession, wider at the walk home). No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm." POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (confession beat, vial-pour). The sentinel's dialogue carries subtext ("He owes me a raincheck") and advances plot. Filter verbs appear occasionally ("I thought of my brother") but fit the reflective register. Minor pattern: several lines open with coordinate constructions ("So I took," "So I told") in the middle third, creating slight template cadence, though not enough to obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("paradoxically steady hush," "the slow mathematics of alteration"). Diction is character-particular (spice names, constellation ink, "warehouse conflagration") and modulates under transformation stress without register drift. However, runs of parallel syntactic stems ("I smell…," "I open…," "I breathe…," "I press…") create template cadence in the conjuration sequence, and the fox's dialogue ("With stories that lick like fire but touch like breath") reads slightly elevated for a beast voice, though the piece's fairy-tale register permits this. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "onyx-ink cartomancer, apprenticed by stormlight, paid in apologies and weathered clocks" establishes idiom early. Perceptual signature is consistent—mythic, charged, specific—but the density of figurative language ("braid," "doorway," "birds deciding a direction," "throat," "pennies in a well") approaches overwriting in mid-story beats without always clarifying causality. Diction remains stable under pressure ("choking beauty," "the minutes assent like dew"). No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Filter verbs appear sparingly and voice-motivated. The final paragraph modulates rhythm effectively but some metaphors in the middle third feel stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: compressed poetic syntax ("a droplet of patient glass," "roomness itself"), metaphoric consistency (stitching/suturing throughout), and stable first-person present reflective mode. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the narrator notices tears, seams, structural vulnerability. Minor artifact: occasional elevated diction ("phosphorescent threads," "interstice") slightly exceeds plain speech but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close embodiment ("my joy loosened me") and wider reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with a consistent lyric register ("vibrant hush," "velvet hem," "slippered like wet sand"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and coherent. Dialogue is minimal—the boy's two lines and Mara's response are naturalistic and goal-driven. Two slips: "the way a street musician orchestrates coincidences until melody finds a pocket" is clever but slightly authorial, and "she wanted to learn by doing, to touch change" edges into abstract philosophizing rather than staying embedded in perception. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("winking hush," "tried out a costume," "metal stuttered") and purposeful syntactic inversion sustain a narrative stance that modulates pressure without breaking idiom. Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. Figurative density is high but patterned early—"keys clinked like cool birds," "fear tries to giggle"—teaching the reader the texture before relying on it at closure. However, some constructions approach ornamental register drift: "a republic of little suns," "hope can be an infant with fists" feel elevated past the sentinel's embodied lexicon, especially under peak stress. No dialogue appears; the collective "we" briefly dilutes focalization when "companions arrived in ones and twos," though internal texture quickly returns. Free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature—metal as honest, doors as blessings—remains character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct lyric-compression style: "The dawn that finds me is borrowed, thin as breath over the sea." Perceptual signature is consistent—mathematical and ritualistic ("I hum the numbers until they taste like salt")—and diction stays within the focalizer's idiom (precise geometric terms, metaphysical phrasing). The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter declaratives at the climax ("I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee, and neither do I"). However, some lines approach self-aware poeticism ("I am held at a slant by the futures that keep arriving early") that risks distance inconsistency, and the villagers' voices are summarized rather than heard directly, missing an opportunity for dialogue distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Ilya. Perceptual signature is strong: "rarefy around his ribs," "air seemed to thin." Dialogue (Mara's) feels purposeful and advances plot, though her lexicon ("curator of broken things," "masks slip") occasionally lifts into thematic register. Diction remains mostly controlled, but phrases like "furiously tranquil" and "storm-kissed wonder" read as imposed descriptors rather than Ilya's internal idiom under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: elevated diction ("borderland," "conciliator," "libretto of streets") remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Dialogue between protagonist and courier differentiates lightly by register (courier more martial, protagonist more philosophical) and advances goals. Free indirect interiority is clean. The prose modulates appropriately under duel pressure with shorter clauses. Perceptual signature is consistent: the world filtered through philosophical metaphor and mechanical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person singular POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("I am the vagrant penny poet," "whispering meter to calm my ribs"). Diction is lyric and compressed ("a shipwreck of pages and iron," "green cursive up the scars"), and the experimental compression is taught early and sustained. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("translators of ruin," "blooming resistance") that feels more prompt-echo than the narrator's lived idiom under physical labor. Mara's brief dialogue ("catalog number") and the child's question are naturalistic, but voice distinction between narrator and Mara converges in the reflective passages where both characters' interior textures sound similar.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person voice is sustained with a distinct lyric register ("time that refuses to keep me," "darkness signs the staff where memory breathes") and perceptual signature (compasses, arbor, the grain of wood as sound source). Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for real-time narration ("strategically creative, the way I map mornings as if they were chords waiting for resolve" reads more like retrospective gloss than live thought). Figurative density is high throughout, which suits the lyric mode, but a few constructions feel labored ("the horizon invites night" appears twice, threading into formula).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person singular POV is stable; narrative distance and perceptual signature are consistent ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt"). Diction is elevated and lyric ("nocturnes," "palimpsest," "pandan"), matching the conceptual frame. Under peak stress (monsoon arriving, final rite), compression is purposeful and the narrator's internal texture holds. Two frictions lower the score: (1) some figurative language feels decorative rather than voice-inevitable ("a library walking," "egrets… settle upon shoulders"), and (2) the villagers' collective voice is referenced but never individuated—they whisper, answer, kneel, but remain interchangeable. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV; distance is stable and the voice ("slow-spoken," "rhythmically placid syllables") matches the tutor's craft-centered worldview. Perceptual signature is consistent (tools, tides, craft vocabulary). Figurative density is high but largely coherent ("grief … told to whisper," "apologies have colors"). Minor deduction: "the ache that guided my hands to diffuse what was sharp" introduces therapy-adjacent abstraction in a peak beat, and the phrase "nostalgia had gravity" leans ornamental. Purposeful compression and lyric syntax are taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, marrying scientific precision with lyric metaphor in a way that feels rooted in this particular mind. The neutron-star researcher’s perceptual habits—seeing “gradients,” slopes vs. cliffs, spin-down, beacons—color both diction and syntax without slipping into generic elevated prose. POV distance is well controlled: reflective passages always hook to present stimuli (glass, dust, orchids, radio beacons) and feed back into action. Even brief mention of the botanist’s arrival and shared planning maintains the same textured, interior lens without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in glasswork, heat, and pattern-reading. Syntax and rhythm are controlled and modulate gently with discovery, sustaining a contemplative but not static tone. POV boundaries are clear, and the narrator’s inferences feel grounded in her experience and profession rather than authorial intrusion. The uniform high-register lyricism slightly flattens emotional peaks, but it remains coherent with her character and the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly lyric, with metaphors that feel native to this character’s sensibility (“bubbles that forget to burst,” “midwifing crescendos”). Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity while maintaining a coherent perceptual signature tuned to soundlessness and temperature. There is no head-hopping; even mentions of others’ inner states are grounded in observable cues like thermals, breath, and gesture. The voice carries both world-building and emotion without resorting to exposition-heavy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is coherent, distinctive, and texturally rich, with metaphors (e.g., sea as librarian, grief as water wearing a channel) that feel native to this undertaker’s mind. Diction and syntax stay stable yet modulate with pressure, maintaining clarity even as the imagery grows more surreal. The limited but confident interior access keeps us inside his worldview without explanatory overreach. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage; elision and lyricism are pattern-taught and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person plural voice is distinctive, steady, and well-controlled, with a clear communal sensibility that never fractures into confusing head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are purposeful, with recurring syntactic patterns (“We went in pairs like breath and echo…”) that feel like liturgy rather than template. The metaphor of “amplified quiet” and the attention to sound, touch, and small motions of the bell give the voice a memorable perceptual signature. It stops just shy of exemplary because the lyric register is so elevated and uniform that moments of sharper, plainer texture under peak stress might have given the voice even more dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and clearly not generic literary diction; metaphors feel native to this mind (“a breathing lantern,” “a pilgrim of sparks,” “smaller breaths”). Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough to feel lived but with enough altitude for lyric reflection. There is no head-hopping, and the absence of dialogue fits the contemplative, ritualized scene. The only ceiling is that, at times, the voice edges toward thematic exposition, which slightly blurs the otherwise excellent perceptual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, lyrical register that feels consistent with a hedge maze designer obsessed with geometry and time (“curving hedges into negative space,” “a lung of green shadow”). POV is stable and modest; it never claims knowledge beyond the narrator’s perceptions, and the temporal weirdness is filtered through her embodied experience. Rhythmic control is excellent—long, sinuous sentences for reverie, tightened cadence for key turns (“I pried the shard free,” “I set the fragment on a plate of cambium”). The prose’s figurative density is high but pattern-taught early enough that it reads like a coherent perceptual signature, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and textured, blending precision with metaphor in a way that clearly reflects this particular mind (“faint as a swallow’s apology,” “pods that split like smiles”). Psychic distance is well-controlled: we stay close to her perceptions yet the narration never claims knowledge she doesn’t have. Rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, tightening at action beats (decoding, opening the hatch, Collectors arriving) and relaxing just enough for backstory without loss of tension. There’s no head-hopping and no register drift; even the more aphoristic lines feel like thematically heightened but in-character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and stable: technical lexicon (“cochlear organoids,” “contact mics”) coexists naturally with lyric color-hearing and maritime salvage detail. Perceptual bias is strong and consistent—everything is filtered through sound, color, and material absence, reinforcing both character and theme. The modulation from cool, process-focused narration to more tremulous cadence in the forge and father scenes is controlled and purposeful. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; even reflective passages feel grounded in the current sensory moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (light, reflection, codes, and tide metaphors) that feels like this specific person’s mind at work. Lyricism is sustained without wobbling into vagueness, and the brief bits of dialogue sit naturally within the elevated register. Psychic distance is well managed: the narrator can coin stylish phrases yet still feel like someone experiencing the scene in real time rather than an authorial commentator. The brief shift to describing “our mother” and the doubled self is handled cleanly without POV slippage confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent: baroque but purposeful diction, ritualistic “Cue the…” refrains, and a gently theatrical self-awareness that suits someone who narrates to dust and machines. POV is stable and modest; we never slip out of what this narrator can know, and reflective passages are anchored in present stimuli (drips, bookmark, intercom) rather than floating essay. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence length and parallelism used to build a liturgical cadence without falling into monotony. The tonal blend of earnestness and sly humor (“even machines fear the cold of indifference”) feels character-driven rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is highly distinct: metaphor-rich, stunt-and-phobia-inflected, with consistent diction (“my breath keeps arguing with itself,” “mapped exits more faithfully than saints trace halos”). POV control is tight; we never slip out of this consciousness, and the reflective density matches her keyed-up, adrenaline-slowed perception. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, maintaining character distinction and subtext in Kellan’s line about “only the body that bruises.” Under stress the rhythm shortens and focuses without losing the established texture, showing good modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is supple, idiosyncratic, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (“pulse like wet clay,” “chapel made of weather”) and a stable focalization. Lyric density is high but patterned and purposeful, and dialogue lines are brief, distinct, and embedded with subtext (especially the “out/through” exchange). The narrative confidently manages time and psychic distance without head-hopping, even with the occasional “we” opening. It’s a memorable voice that might benefit from one or two plainer sentences to set off the most striking lines.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is remarkably consistent: a mechanized consciousness speaking in lyric but precise metaphors anchored in maintenance, pipes, dust, and ice. Diction and syntax feel plausibly “robotic-poetic,” avoiding generic workshop lyricism by tying images to tasks (“the city thinks in pipes…,” “snow diagnosing itself”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both conceptual musing and tactile immediacy without head-hopping or stance wobble. Patterned phrasing reinforces the loop structure and meditative tone without collapsing into monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinct yet stable, with patterned phrases (“after words become unnecessary”) taught early and reused in purposeful refrains. Sensory focus and metaphor choices (bowls, glints, ash, whispering crystal) feel like this particular registrar’s inward register, not generic “poetic” overlay. Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying close enough for emotional specificity while allowing some reflective abstraction. There is no head-hopping, and the lack of spoken dialogue suits the articulated conceit of a post-verbal world.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with metaphors that feel organically tied to age, horticulture, and work. Syntax and rhythm vary purposefully, sustaining lyricism without losing clarity. The Auditor’s brief dialogue contrasts effectively with the narrator’s more figurative diction, underscoring status and worldview. POV remains tight and reliable; any philosophical reach is clearly marked as the narrator’s thought, not omniscient drift.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with phrases like “crouched on the ice shelf like a careful thought” and “notes from their dream repertoire” establishing a clear perceptual signature. Third-person focalization stays cleanly with Hale while allowing just enough external lyricism to feel like his sensibility rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-directed, carrying subtext (Sera’s concern, his reassurance) without over-explaining. Rhythm and diction modulate well with the experiment’s quiet intensification, though the voice remains uniformly elevated, which fits but slightly limits contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends technical musical awareness and haunted attentiveness (“a single wrong sound, consummately placed, can realign a theater”). Diction is elevated but plausible for a reflective musician-narrator, and the cadence modulates well between atmospheric description and high-pressure beats. There is no head-hopping; even references to rumors and other people’s beliefs stay within what she could plausibly know. The lyricism never quite tips into opacity, maintaining legibility of action and thought.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise yet technically grounded, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by science, grief, and fever-haze. Anthropomorphizing the oracle and weather station feels like this character’s psychology, not authorial intrusion, and the pattern is taught early and sustained. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—more incantatory around fever and margins, tighter and clearer around the warning call—without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction is plausible for this narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent industrial-lyric idiom (“panic smears truth like grease,” “a machine that never stops”) that matches the narrator’s obsessions. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay close enough to feel her bodily risk and mental tallying without omniscient leakage. Patterned diction and metaphor are purposeful and taught early, so the high lyric register reads as character-specific rather than generic purple prose. There are no POV slips or unmotivated shifts in register, and the closing modulation in rhythm underscores the new awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrically distinctive, and remarkably consistent in its metaphoric logic (“ash drifted like moths that had outgrown the idea of flame,” “a shelter black as a kept secret”). POV is stable, with no leakage or unmotivated omniscience, and the diction feels organic to a mind steeped in archives and ruin. Rhythm varies well between lush description and quieter, declarative insights, sustaining musicality without obvious mechanical patterning. The only reservation is that the high lyric density never fractures under pressure, so we don’t get the sharp modulation one might expect when the ceiling cracks or fear peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective, artfully articulate therapist; diction and rhythm are distinct without feeling mannered. POV remains tight to the narrator’s perceptions, and brief dialogue snippets feel natural and goal-directed. The prose modulates well with pressure, softening in the clean silence of totality and sharpening around key beats like the “mama” utterance. Some figurative turns sound more like a literary narrator than a working clinician, which nudges voice slightly toward artifice at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is highly controlled, with a strong perceptual signature built on sound, material, and metaphor (“rolled ear,” “bronze quiet,” “broken freight syllables”). Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mythic, post-human frame and never breaks register. Psychic distance stays stable: we’re always close to his mode of attention even when the narration briefly adopts quasi-omniscient statements about history and cosmology. The voice modulates subtly toward greater clarity and intention at the end (“began the probe of writing”), making the closure feel earned rather than merely ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphors (bureaucracy vs. tide, driftwood into letters, dots into worlds). POV stays close to Mei while allowing a gently omniscient lyric reach that never breaks coherence. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially Elias’s line about some secrets dying by daylight and Mei’s “the island speaks best in the open.” Under pressure, the voice modulates gracefully rather than flattening into either purple or mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and closely aligned with the conceptual concerns of the scene; diction like “arguments into listening” and “each word wore gloves” feels unified rather than stitched. POV is stable—no head-hopping—and the slight omniscient sheen suits the metaphysical register. Dialogue is spare but purposeful, carrying subtext about power, fear, and desire without explicating it. Under pressure, the voice maintains control rather than slipping into explanation or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly controlled, with a stable psychic distance and a clear perceptual signature (e.g., translating every sensory input into musical/structural terms). Diction is elevated but consistent with the introspective, metaphor-loving mind of this narrator, and the patterned syntax feels intentional rather than generic. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; time and space are cleanly handled within the meditative ascent. Under pressure, rhythm modulates (slightly shorter, sharper lines around the cold and percussion) without breaking the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confidently lyric, and consistent; its blend of concrete urban detail with metaphysical logic (“song learned by water,” “smallest gate in the world”) feels like one mind’s patterned way of seeing. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, with variation that matches emotional intensity, and the temporal stance remains stable. The piece teaches its poetic elisions early and then uses them coherently as the maze unfolds, so we never feel cheated by withheld facts. Diction stays within a plausible, idiosyncratic lexicon for this narrator—elevated but not academic—and there is no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture shaped by Lena’s tactile experience of sound—phrases like “heard with bones and remembered with skin” feel both character-specific and tonally unified. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; the narrative stance never drifts into clinical or expository register. The measured, incantatory cadence modulates well with pressure, tightening around the ritual and relaxing slightly in the classroom without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping, and the voice’s certainty stays aligned with what Lena can plausibly perceive or infer.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and texturally consistent, blending meteorological observation with ethical reflection in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Diction and syntax are steady in register, and psychic distance is well-managed; even dense metaphors remain legible.

Elision and lyric compression are taught from the first sentence and maintained without confusing spatial or temporal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a strong, consistent perceptual signature (lanterns, ribs of glass, crystal, shadows, breath). Lexicon and rhythm fit a narrator who trades in metaphor-laden, almost mystical technology without feeling artificially elevated. Dr. Vale’s dialogue is sparse but distinct in cadence and content, carrying his own history and philosophy without hijacking the narrative voice. The piece teaches its figurative and syntactic pattern early and sustains it through the climax without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (treating objects as sentient, time as textured, ethics as play). Diction and rhythm are carefully controlled, using metaphor densely but legibly, and modulating toward greater stillness at the climax (“The second thins, the grotto air rippling…”). Occasional dialogue is spare and purposeful, fitting the world and avoiding exposition dumps. The narrator’s stance—curious, gently ironic, ethically engaged—remains stable without feeling monotone.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct acoustic sensibility and patterned metaphors that feel unified rather than piled-on. Third-person close around Mara gradually widens into a communal “we” at the end, and that shift reads intentional given the story’s arc toward shared tradition. Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful—shorter, percussion-like phrases at intensifying moments (“almost a word, almost a forgiveness”), longer cadences for atmosphere. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the one-step-out collective voice at the close enhances, rather than muddles, the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with a controlled yet inventive metaphor palette (“the way fish hear riverbeds,” “belief kissed doubt and decided to go steady”) that feels like this specific narrator’s cognition. Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate with pressure without slipping into generic lyricism or academic register. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext and refracting the thematic concerns (“Subsume nothing…let us channel, not drown”). The piece teaches its slightly heightened, poetic mode early and sustains it through closure without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses dockside pragmatism and almost religious attentiveness to small gestures. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, varying between longer, musical sentences and tighter turns (“We had begun something gentle yet sturdy…”). Metaphor choices feel character-rooted—this is someone who naturally reads tides, cranes, ledgers, and stagecraft into everything—so the elevated diction doesn’t break POV plausibility. No POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” moments undercut the intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a lyrical yet grounded perceptual signature anchored in the sculptor’s material sensibility. Imagery and diction (“salt still cataloged along their spines like soft annotations,” “where bodies made shade that could hold rumor without bruising it”) feel unified, not like generic poeticism. Psychic distance stays stable and intimate; we never head-hop or slip into an omniscient stance. Under emotional peak (sigil discovery, dedication), the rhythm tightens and remains controlled, preserving clarity while heightening charge.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a natural history illustrator who thinks in anatomy and taxonomy (“bones of timing and lungs of space”). Rhythm and diction are controlled despite density, with metaphor and syntax tuned to the character’s observational bent rather than generic “poetic” style. The psychic distance holds steady, and worldbuilding is delivered through her perceptions instead of expository intrusion. There’s no dialogue until the final beat, where the watcher’s one line lands cleanly and tonally aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive: a fusion of arcane ritual diction and mathematical metaphor that feels unified and character-specific. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, lyrical lines that nonetheless stay clear and modulate intensity around key beats (the orchard’s pause, the apprentice’s appearance). POV is stable and modest in its claims, never leaking into knowledge the narrator couldn’t plausibly infer. The prose reads as a singular consciousness rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a maintenance-architectural lexicon (“pipe chases,” “archaeology of maintenance”) braided with almost devotional lyricism. Rhythm and syntax are controlled—short declaratives (“I make no steps, only routes.”) balance more sinuous lines to manage tension and lull. The narrator’s perceptual bias toward infrastructure and residue is consistent throughout, and Mara’s brief spoken line carries its own palpable timbre. The voice never breaks register or drifts into authorial explanation, even under emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinctive sensibility for weather, texture, and subtle humor (“circuitously sincere,” “the wind had other syllables for me”). Diction and metaphor are consistent with a thoughtful, observant nursery owner; the reflective distance remains stable and credible. Theo’s few lines and descriptions carry a slightly different idiom, enough to distinguish him without diluting the central voice. Rhythmic patterns (“I would…,” “I kept…”) read as intentional incantation rather than mechanical repetition, supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently colored by the painter’s sensibility (“like a joke that had learned to bow to the wind,” “measuring a flood with your own bones”).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“my question comes back like gulls returning, beaks bright with small reflections”). Diction and metaphor feel organic to a mystic who treats sound, shadow, and stone as collaborators rather than abstractions. POV is stable and modest—no unjustified knowledge leaps, and compression of time feels intentional and legible. At times the prose rhythm and figurative density become slightly uniform, risking a blur between high and lower-pressure moments, but clarity is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, maritime, and archival—with patterned metaphors that feel unified rather than decorative. Diction (“reactively visionary,” “navigated absences”) fits this narrator’s quasi-mystical professional stance and remains consistent. Rhythm is controlled, with recurring sentence shapes used as intentional cadence rather than mechanical template, and the occasional dialogue lines remain simple and in-character. The voice sustains intensity across the piece without significant drift or strain.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and deeply tied to the character’s mapping obsession, with metaphors that feel like this narrator’s way of perceiving (“route like a breathing equation,” “cracks in pavement forming arrows”). Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both concrete action and reflective insight without head-hopping or stance drift. Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early and maintained without obscuring clarity. The only thing holding it just shy of 9+ is that rhythmic variation, while strong, occasionally edges toward a uniform lushness in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and deeply textured, with metaphors that feel like extensions of this specific mind (“whale migration…horizon stitched itself with slow breaths”). Psychic distance is handled with confidence; even highly figurative lines remain grounded in the narrator’s sensory and ethical experience. There is no head-hopping, and the lyric density modulates subtly at key emotional beats so that pivotal choices remain clear. The voice also reflects character—skeptical yet reverent, self-aware but not clinical—rather than reading as generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, blending cosmic scale with wry, weary precision (“even boredom respects a fruit that knows its own falling”). Diction and metaphor clearly belong to a dimensionally aware immortal, and Mara’s brief spoken lines feel distinct and functional. The lyric compression and occasional paradoxes (“a corridor the color of forgotten promises”) are pattern-taught early and sustained without slipping into confusion. Under peak pressure, the voice maintains control and doesn’t flatten or drift into generic register.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in profession and history (formal-in, tags, shrouds, ledgers). Diction is elevated but plausibly belonging to a reflective, educated mortuary worker; it never drifts into alien register. Dialogue is sparse but sharp and status-aware, especially in the exchange with the officers where habit and professional cadence become her main tools. The voice modulates rhythm well between slower, reflective lines and tighter, beat-driven sentences as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and intimately bound to the narrator’s sensibility: meticulous, ceremonial, and quietly wry. Diction and imagery (“incandescent restraint,” “letters again,” “guests who carry their own chairs”) feel organic to this particular mind rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is well controlled: we remain close to perception and thought without omniscient leakage or unmotivated register shifts. The modulation from observational calm to charged quiet at the end is handled with confident rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, dense with metaphor yet controlled, and consistently tied to this narrator’s way of seeing (“a murder that had learned to bathe,” “a map without lines or legends”). POV is stable and plausibly limited; even when she imagines what containers or the dead “prefer,” it reads as lyrical projection, not omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the woman’s line about machines never listening, which carries subtext about power and dispossession. The only minor check is that the lyric compression sometimes verges on uniform cadence, reducing dynamic range under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with an idiosyncratic metaphor palette (“even disappointment arrives with its own blanket and mug”; “the cello hummed like a stray cat deciding to trust”). Psychic distance and register remain steady while allowing lyrical flourish, and the narrator’s perceptions feel plausibly theirs rather than authorial. The patterned, slightly whimsical solemnity supports both the magical premise and the emotional arc. A few lines flirt with over-crafted aphorism, but they don’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphors that feel rooted in the character’s world (“confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies braided together”).

Occasional high-flown phrases remain plausible for this narrator and are thematically motivated. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure, particularly around the negotiation and final pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in technical language (bolides, ferrocyanide) braided with metaphor (“the film drinks what remains of unpurchased sky”). Distance is well modulated, allowing both intimate sensory access and broader conceptual framing without slipping into abstract essaying. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrator’s lexicon is plausible for a scientific worker steeped in poetic attention. Rhythm and syntax flex with pressure, especially around the vial’s release and the shutter press, heightening those beats.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly textural, with patterns (“magnetic calm,” iron prayers) that feel intentional rather than random ornament. POV discipline holds; we’re grounded primarily in Mara’s mode of perception, with Jaro’s contributions clearly framed as reported description. Rhythms modulate well between lush description and brisker operational beats (patching, directing the drone). A few lines tilt toward slogan-like abstraction, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The first-person voice is strikingly controlled, with a clear perceptual signature—dry, precise, metaphor-rich, and shaped by a professional intimacy with maps and weather. Diction and syntax (“isobaric prayer,” “alphabet of stones,” “editor of air”) are elevated but plausible for an atlas editor, and the lyric compression never drifts into incoherent abstraction. Psychic distance is stable and apt; we remain inside this mind’s sensibility without unmotivated shifts or head-hopping, and the falcon’s occasional anthropomorphism feels like an extension of voice rather than POV leakage. Rhythm varies intelligently, with long, sinuous sentences for contemplative beats and shorter, cleaner lines around key turns (“The ice receives us without cracking, which is its own kind of threat.”).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is highly controlled and distinctive, with a consistent lyrical register that matches the quasi-mythic scenario. Metaphors are unusually fresh (“like a shadow that expects the moon,” “the air were a loom”) and feel like this narrator’s way of seeing, not generic ornament. Psychic distance stays stable: we inhabit a reflective but present-tense sensibility that never claims knowledge beyond what can be perceived or inferred. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with the pressure, sustaining legibility despite dense imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and stable in distance; the narrator’s metaphoric habit (“cables, nerves of a forgotten city,” “a heart outside my heart”) feels like a genuine perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates effectively, with longer, lusher sentences in observation beats and tauter lines around pressure points like the net and oxygen. POV knowledge stays within what the diver could infer, even when the voice imagines surface reactions. The only minor constraint is that the elevated diction is almost unbroken; a touch more contrast at peak stress could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses mechanical, maritime, and religious imagery (“heart made of clockwork salt,” “jars of yesterday,” “crosshatch smelling of knees”). The lyric density and patterned diction are clearly taught from the outset and carried through without head-hopping or register breaks. Under pressure the voice modulates slightly toward clearer conceptual statements without losing texture, which serves the closure. It stops short of 9+ because the relentless figurative register occasionally flattens moment-to-moment emotional gradation into one rich but uniform mode.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, sensuous, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in lines like “the starless dome that swallowed our horizons” and “her smile was the architecture of every harvest I had ever wanted.” Lyric density is high but controlled; syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity without slipping out of the character’s plausible lexicon. The ghost bride’s speech (“Fool gardener, you would drown a seed to teach it patience...”) is sharply distinct yet tonally integrated. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and patterned elision is clearly taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, musical, and unmistakably specific to this character’s sensibility, blending technical “weaver” lexicon with spiritual and sensory noticing. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with long, lilted sentences that suit the lyric mode yet remain legible and grounded in concrete detail. The accumulative, metaphor-rich diction is taught early and held through closure, and the final cadence (“our new song needs every quiet shard”) feels like a natural culmination rather than a forced flourish. There’s no POV leakage or register drift that breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and deeply tied to the character’s way of seeing (e.g., “questions like water carried light,” skulls that “winked like lanterns”). Rhythm is varied but controlled, with a measured, incantatory feel that matches “cautious enchantment.” Diction reflects an educated, reflective returnee and stays within that register. There’s no dialogue to test contrast, but the narrative stance under pressure (sundial repair, encounter with bones) remains stable and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and texturally rich: metaphors (“mouth full of coins,” “stamps remember mouths”) feel like extensions of this narrator’s sensibility rather than generic ornament. POV control is clean and stable, with no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge leaks. The lyric register—slightly elevated, gently surreal—matches the speculative setting and holds under pressure without sliding into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, with Mira’s few lines signaling need and vulnerability without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a consistent perceptual signature—Tamsin understands the world in terms of cloth, seams, timing, and echoes. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, with patterned diction (“adjacent possibilities,” “unheard stories,” “echoed silence”) that accrues meaning rather than feeling repetitive. The narrative distance stays stable and apt, offering close access without head-hopping or explanatory overreach. Even brief mentions of Rauk are filtered through this same sensibility, maintaining tonal unity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinct, with a strong perceptual signature that blends the fantastic and the mundane (“air tastes like copper and lullabies,” “ache in him like tide under a pier”) in a way that feels character-specific rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance remains controlled: we are close enough to feel the narrator’s embodied anxiety, yet the narration maintains enough composure to sustain its metaphorical density without breaking plausibility. The medium’s presence is rendered through contrastive diction (her “voice full of silt and patience and fierce tenderness”) that maintains a single, coherent POV. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure, tightening around the hospital scene and softening in the return to the mangrove.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the translator’s professional and emotional lens; metaphors feel native to the character’s sea-bound and conflict-tuned perception. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure—the decoding passages slow into intricate observation, while the negotiation outside is more direct but still charged with subtext. There’s no head-hopping; even when summarizing the families’ reactions, the narration stays within what the focalizer can see and infer. The “lotus-hearted ache” register is elevated but controlled, never drifting into academic or contrived diction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (technical/artistic vocabulary, synesthetic metaphors, playful gravitas). The lyric compression and patterned imagery are taught from the opening sentence and maintained without head-hopping or distance confusion. Rhythm varies gracefully between longer, baroque lines and tighter pivots, especially around the fog’s encroachment and the grandmother’s appearance. A few metaphors approach flourish-for-flourish’s-sake, but they rarely obscure sense and largely feel anchored in this character’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly particular: technical terms (“transients,” “tonality”) blend naturally with lyric metaphors. Perception is filtered through the sensibility of someone who treats sound as a sculptural medium, giving the prose a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is managed well, allowing reflective expansions (“time flowers outward”) without losing the scene’s anchoring. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the rhythmic control and diction feel deliberate and character-true throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinctive, controlled, and tonally coherent—lyric, slightly ironic, and full of inventive but legible metaphor (“air turned cashier,” “smelled like wet soil secrets”). The first-person plural/singular “we/I” stance is stable as a collective focalization with clear emotional bias, and there’s no head-hopping. Ilya’s speech registers as more courtly and playful, giving enough differentiation from the narrative voice. Patterned elision and figurative compression are taught early and remain readable through the peak confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent throughout, with a strong perceptual signature in metaphors (“tide leaf,” “seed catalogs scarred by rain,” “sleep avoids me, I say, but peace has been avoiding us longer”). The rhythm varies effectively between incantatory sentences and briefer, declarative turns at key beats, and there is no POV leakage. Refrains like “shyly unstoppable” feel integral to voice rather than tic. Dialogue from blossoms and the Guard is spare but differentiated by idiom (coughs, sighs, clicks), reinforcing the overall tonal control.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature in its fusion of archival precision and dreamy surrealism (“ladders of weather,” “schoolyard comet”). Third-person focalization is steady around the caretaker, and the diction feels consistent with the mythic-fantastic frame. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and patterned phrases (“By the echo of a long-forgotten song”) function as deliberate incantations rather than tics. A slight sameness in high-poetic register across all beats is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a strong, consistent lyrical texture—musical and linguistic metaphors feel native to an “arcane linguist” rather than imposed. POV distance is steady and well-controlled; we stay in the narrator’s sensibility even when the diction rises. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext and character (“You forgot this” lands as both reproach and invitation). Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely between lush description and plainer admissions of guilt, supporting emotional beats rather than competing with them.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, comfortably blending technical and lyrical registers (“numbers arranged to cradle a world without bragging”). The machinist’s perceptual signature—attuned to tools, breath, pattern, and subtle emotional shifts—remains consistent throughout. Lyric density is high but supported by rhythm and clarity; sentences feel shaped rather than ornamental. The elevated diction for a machinist is a stylistic choice that works, but edges toward uniform poise even under stress, which slightly mutes volatility.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, metaphorically rich, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (dust, paper, birds, gravity) that feels inseparable from this character. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, modulating between long, sinuous sentences for reflection and tighter phrasing for key decisions (“Thimble pulsed into the light, a dark seed thrown into sky”). The few spoken lines feel economical and in-character, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift. At times the lyricism approaches saturation; a couple of high-metaphor sentences could be trimmed to let the strongest images ring even more.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (aviation, weather, mazes, and wood as interpretive lenses). Rhythm modulates well, from dense imagistic lines to clearer, declarative moments at turns (“Then I cross the cedar frame…”). Elision and metaphor are pattern-taught early (fractured light, hush, distances) and paid off cleanly at closure. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction feels organic to this character’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, fusing occupational lexicon (sonar plots, vents, ducts) with lyric metaphors in a way that feels character-specific for a “landscape astrologer.” Psychic distance is stable and close, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The modulation around the generator scare and sunrise is subtle but effective, maintaining the “shadowseam wonder” tone while tightening and then softening the rhythm. At times the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, yet it remains plausible for this narrator and does not break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is striking, confident, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“cheerful gloom,” “cobweb math,” “newsprint foam”). Diction and metaphor choices feel organic to a “sea-foam recollectionist” and maintain coherence even as the world grows stranger. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the lyric distance is stable and well-controlled. Rhythmic variety and patterned phrasing support the accumulative mode instead of flattening it.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinctive—precise, metaphor-rich, and consistently filtered through an analytical yet romantic sensibility (“city thinking,” “calculated wilderness”). POV is stable and controlled, and the few lines of dialogue feel natural and in-character, especially the understated “Do you play” and her superstition-tinged assent. Rhythm varies well between longer lyrical sentences and shorter anchoring beats, preventing the prose from drifting into monotone. The only minor limitation is that the high-register diction is very uniform; a bit more modulation under emotional pressure might push this further.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent—lyric yet precise, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in tides, gaps, and bodily knowing. Diction and rhythm vary in a controlled way that supports emotional beats, particularly around the clerk’s doubt and the mutual decision to share exile. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (his question about gentle forgetting; her implicit argument through demonstration). The narrative distance stays stable and interior, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently rooted in a glazier’s perceptual and conceptual lexicon (seams, bevels, stress, light). POV is stable, with no leakage or unjustified knowledge; even abstract moments (“noctilucent reckonings”) feel like this narrator’s metaphoric thinking. Dialogue is spare but effective and character-specific, contrasting the harbor master’s practical register with the glazier’s oblique, image-driven speech. Rhythm and diction modulate with emotional beats while maintaining a cohesive, memorable narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with lyrical but coherent diction that fits an introspective, experienced firefighter rather than reading like generic essay prose. Mira’s spoken lines are distinct in rhythm and conceptual framing (“the sky forgets nothing…,” “stars are old wounds turned into navigation”), setting her apart without breaking POV. The narrative maintains a stable distance and never head-hops, and patterned phrases like “hinge between ruin and renewal” feel voice-motivated. A few constructions flirt with over-poetic abstraction, but they do not disrupt clarity or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a rare but convincing blend of analytic and dreamlike diction (“logical dreamer,” “let it learn new tides,” “algorithm of gatherings”) that remains consistent throughout. POV control is tight: we never drift outside the narrator’s perception, and temporal/spatial references to parallel timelines are handled as part of their understood reality. Rhythm varies well, with longer, sinuous sentences for conceptual musing and shorter declaratives at key turns (“I had been measuring heights, but hope was a sum of simultaneous notes, not a single ladder.”). The lyric compression never obscures what’s actually happening, which is difficult at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a distinctive, consistent texture—lyric, metaphorically inventive, and clearly shaped by someone who thinks in acoustics and architecture (“soft choreography that sound remembers,” “walls dream in montage”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both close sensory impressions and reflective re-framings without slipping POV. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (more compressed around the ethical reveal, more expansive in exploratory passages) while staying coherent. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator’s perceptual signature is memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, slightly omniscient lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature built from recurring motifs (echo, rainbows, heartbeat, bells). Syntax and diction are carefully modulated, creating a musical cadence that matches the piece’s ritualized quality. Brief dialogue aligns with the established register and avoids flattening the voice. The only restraint on an even higher score is the uniform lushness; more variation in texture at key stress points could have deepened contrast without breaking the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (ritual, texture, moral calculus) and controlled rhythm. Elevated diction fits the role and setting and never drifts into implausible register; syntactic variation supports both ceremony and stress. Brief dialogue moments feel purposeful and in character even without quotation marks, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and maintained, so they read as controlled style rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—coldly self-aware, lyrical, and steeped in technocratic and curatorial registers that suit an amoral philanthropist. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with balanced long, metaphor-rich lines and sharper declaratives (“But the world is not a wish, and my ledger has teeth”). The psychic distance stays steady: intimate access without omniscient drift, and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but plausible for this character, making the lyricism feel like personality rather than authorial overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is a confident, controlled lyrical third-person with a distinct idiom (“Breathing like a lamp,” “between sigh and smile”) that remains consistent and character-aligned. The patterned diction and syntax teach their rhythm early and are sustained through closure without drift or head-hopping, and the psychic distance is steady: intimate but slightly ceremonial, fitting Lira’s disciplined vocation. There is no dialogue to test, but interior and narrative texture fuse into a strong perceptual signature. Occasionally the elevated, near-incantatory register risks smoothing over sharper, idiosyncratic thought patterns that could make Lira feel even more singular.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically precise yet controlled, with a strong perceptual signature anchored in Aurel’s sensibility (ink, reflection, lines “trembling like an artery”). Rhythm and diction modulate well between interior reflection, description, and spare dialogue. Dialogue, when used, is lean and character-revealing—Ferro talking to the moth, the plain-spoken apology—and doesn’t undercut the narrative voice. The occasional elevated metaphor still feels organic to an “urbane calligrapher” rather than an imposed register.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent: intellectual yet sensorial, with a controlled lyricism that fits an “esoteric realist” who reads winds and histories. Diction and metaphor feel like one mind’s patterned way of seeing (light “practicing restraint,” clouds as “sleeping herds”), and the psychic distance stays steady. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even abstract reflections are anchored in perception and action. The density of lyricism is high but disciplined enough that it enhances rather than obscures focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strong, consistent, and deeply textured, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in craft metaphors and sensory noticing (“aurora slip across the ice like spectral brass,” “my breath sparking like tin shavings”). Psychic distance is well-controlled: lyric reaches never lose track of concrete action or tools in hand. Diction sits plausibly within an educated, ritual-trained artisan’s register, and the rhythm modulates effectively between long, braided sentences and shorter, emphatic beats at turns. The voice is rich but not ostentatious, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with consistent lyric diction (“archived lightning,” “choir of fog”) that feels like a specific consciousness rather than generic purple prose. POV is stable and controlled; interiority and description remain tightly bound to Only’s perception. Rhythmic variation and image choice give the narration a memorable texture that modulates well as pressure grows. Occasionally, the density of figurative language risks feeling ornamental, but it rarely undercuts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature: austere, metaphorically rich, and shaped by an empiricist steeped in ancient bureaucratic and astronomical thinking. Diction and rhythm (“piety with proofs,” “citizen of neither crown,” “eventless spaces where meaning collects unnoticed”) are controlled and purposeful, matching the character’s learned, ascetic cast of mind. Psychic distance is steady, with lyric compression that never slips into omniscient explanation or breaks POV plausibility. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative stance under pressure—especially at the eyelid and ash mirror—remains precise and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends grief, intellect, and a quasi-mystical pragmatism (“a thorn had learned mercy”). Mara’s dialogue is terser and more guarded, giving her a distinct cadence against the narrator’s reflective density. The sanctuary’s effects and the cellular-memory frame are filtered squarely through the narrator’s sensibility, avoiding head-hopping despite metaphysical elements. Rhythmic variation and image choice support emotional shifts without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive, image-rich lexicon that clearly belongs to a craftsman in a numinous, ruined landscape. Patterned phrasing (“erasing boundaries,” “synchronized breathing”) is taught early and reused with intent, not as empty refrain. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and the narrative distance stays stably intimate while allowing occasional lyric expansions. The prose modulates enough to track escalation without losing its core texture.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, blending guild jargon with plant and stone metaphors in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Sentence rhythm varies well; aphoristic lines (“We keep the roots; we let the leaves do the leaving”) land as organic thought, not authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with kids’ speech clearly distinguished in register and function from the narrator’s. The high level of polish and consistency would stand up in a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and textured, blending cosmic-strange observation with wry specificity (“wrapped in gauze and worry,” “simply complicated…strung in vacuum”). Diction and rhythm feel plausibly like this particular curator—bookish, scientifically curious, slightly bemused—without sliding into generic “poetic” register. POV control is tight; associative leaps are legible, and the lyric density is pattern-taught from the first line. The only small limitation is that the voice maintains a relatively uniform lushness; a slightly sharper modulation under peak stress might add extra charge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently lyrical, with metaphors (“gaps are the mountain’s negative space, a score of rests”) that feel organic to an arcane linguist in this world. POV is stable and focused, with no head-hopping; any omniscience is plausibly grounded in the library’s logic and the narrator’s professional attentiveness. Rhythm and syntax vary to modulate pressure, and the diction stays coherent with the narrator’s sensibility even at peak beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional and carries subtext (Palinode’s warning about grammar, the traveler’s confession about apology).

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“pocket storms,” “tired constellation,” “trapped freedom that moved because we leaned”). The narrative distance stays stable even when the twin externalizes; we still read under a coherent singular lens. Rhythm and diction are controlled and varied, with metaphor serving character and mood rather than feeling generically “poetic.” The piece takes stylistic risks that pay off, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—precise, contemplative, slightly wry—and it remains consistent in diction and stance throughout. Phrases like “I read patterns as if they are weather for the mind” and “feeding it soup until it spoke” give a clear perceptual signature that matches an archivist comfortable with metaphor and careful thought. The lyric compression and occasional abstractions are controlled enough to stay legible, and POV never slips. It doesn’t quite reach the very top because the modulation under “pressure” isn’t significantly different from the baseline meditative tone, so peak beats don’t gain much extra rhythmic intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and clearly that of a specialist whose metaphors and perceptions arise from stone, sound, and mapping. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with lyric density that still maintains legibility, and the psychic distance remains steady. The narrator’s idiom (“the cave writes with fracture,” “weather that refuses to break”) feels unified rather than like rotating styles. There is no POV leakage or gratuitous explanation; the voice trusts its own strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, richly lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kera’s sensibility, with metaphors that feel native to her world of wind, glass, and sea (“like a sleepy whale,” “a river discovering a forgotten braid”). Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with longer, rolling sentences for contemplative beats and tighter lines at turns (the beam faltering, the answer flare). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; retrocognitive passages are anchored cleanly in her physical acts of touching the prism. The elevated diction is uniform and intentional, though it leaves little room for contrast or roughness at peak emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive—lyric, image-rich, and filtered through a professional, quasi-mystical sensibility that remains consistent throughout. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, modulating between longer, meditative lines and shorter, declarative insights at key turns (“This is my flaw and my tool.”). The perceptual signature (thinking in weather, shadows, and archival metaphors) feels inseparable from character and world. There is no POV leakage or register drift; the elevated diction fits this educated, ritualized role and strengthens the piece’s unity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct cadence that marries technical detail (“mixed stars,” “filtered the charcoal”) to metaphor (“earth to speak upward,” “gravity had consented to share its work”). POV distance is stable and appropriate: we stay near Lio while occasionally widening to town-level perception without head-hopping or confusion. Recurrent phrases (e.g., “he chants while walking”) feel like deliberate rhythmic motifs rather than tics. It’s an assured, memorable narrative texture well-suited to this accumulative, ritual-like story.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—patient, marine-biological, and quietly reverent—with a clear perceptual signature (sorting “gleams, slow grazers, and respiring sand”). Diction and metaphor are consistently filtered through this sensibility, and the psychic distance stays stable even as it admits reflective passages. The few on-page spoken lines feel plausible and subtext-rich, letting most of the conversation live in implication and image. Under peak pressure the voice remains controlled rather than overwrought, maintaining coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice has a strong perceptual signature, blending precise sensory detail with inventive yet controlled metaphor (“silence here is intangibly tangible, a pressure that lifts, a weight made of the way light forgets to speak”). Diction and imagery stay consistent with a character who has lived both in engineered bunkers and liminal sky-space, and there’s no POV leakage or register drift. Rhythmic variation supports pressure: longer, lush sentences carry the ritual and reflection, while clipped phrases (“I taste the bunker and I do not break”) sharpen turning points. The patterned returns (“by limiting exposure”) feel voice-driven rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is remarkably consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses technical attentiveness (“monitoring noise levels,” “storm glass vial”) and lyric patterning. Diction choices (“vaulting hush,” “the terrace rose to meet our slowness”) feel motivated by this character’s lived intimacy with sound and motion, not generic poetizing. Psychic distance is steady and appropriate for a reflective professional mid-task; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. To reach the very top band, one might want a slightly sharper modulation of rhythm at peak pressure to contrast more strongly with the lulls.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses technical and mythic registers (“first station where the kings boarded tides,” “maintainer drone…broadcasting a lullaby”). Diction and syntax are well-controlled, and the lyric density feels like Maris’s worldview rather than authorial ornament, especially in how she maps media-era metaphors onto natural phenomena. POV boundaries are clean—no head-hopping, no unjustified knowledge—and the occasional aphoristic line (“sometimes guardians need excuses for bravery”) remains grounded in character. The only reason this doesn’t push into the very top band is that the voice rarely modulates under pressure; it maintains one gorgeous register rather than flexing rhythmically at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with an evident perceptual signature (liminal, ritualistic, fire-and-breath lexicon). Lyric density is high but controlled; images like “a lung that had forgotten its own rhythm” and “a moon had learned patience” feel of a piece rather than ornamental. Dialogue is sparse yet effective, carrying subtext and urgency without breaking the poetic register. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the patterned diction is clearly taught from the opening line and sustained to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with coinages like “shadowseam wonder,” “a chamber patched from canning vats and prayer,” and “diamond that remembered every mouth that spoke” establishing a clear perceptual signature. Diction and metaphor density suit a narrator who thinks in systems and symbols but remains emotionally grounded. The integration of technical detail (gauges, gaskets, tanks) with mythic/lyric language feels intentional rather than mismatched. Psychic distance stays stable; even the parallel selves’ texts are filtered cleanly through this singular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strong, consistent, and distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature (political trauma filtered through synesthetic, acoustic, and archival imagery). Lyric density is high but controlled, with patterns (horn as judge, standing waves, golden shadows) taught early and paid off at closure. There’s no head-hopping or POV leakage; the elevated diction fits a reflective, educated heir and stays within a plausible lexicon. Psychic distance modulates smoothly, tightening at key beats without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident and tonally consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries quasi-scientific diction (“factually mystical,” “inventory of scents behaving exactly as equations do”) to mythic imagery. Psychic distance is stable, staying close enough to the knight to feel embodied while permitting a slightly elevated register appropriate to the piece’s ambitions. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shift, and rhythm modulates effectively as pressure builds.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with archival metaphors (“grief…measured by paper weight,” “dust to confess its constellations”) that feel intrinsic to this narrator’s mind. POV boundaries are clean: no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience beyond reasonable inference. Rhythm and diction modulate subtly with emotional beats, tightening around discoveries and softening in reflective spans. A few recurrent images (dust, constellations, maps) flirt with over-patterning but remain controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythms and precise diction, and it stays stable and character-coherent throughout. Phrasing like “the city hummed with coded freedom” and “the hatch sighed open like a confession” shows a consistent perceptual bias without drifting into register that feels alien to the world. Limited dialogue is concise and in-character, serving as action rather than exposition, especially in the contact’s brief, textured response (“a cough and a laugh”). Psychic distance contracts and expands smoothly with pressure, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with a consistent sonic and mist-laden lexicon that matches a saxophonist steeped in atmosphere. Rhythm varies between long, flowing sentences and shorter declaratives at key turns (“Now the cave does speak…” / “Now I lower the horn…”), supporting emotional beats. There is no POV slippage; uncertainty and metaphor arise from the narrator’s sensibility rather than authorial haze. The high lyric register feels earned and character-rooted, not grafted on.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, textured, and clearly tuned to Fen’s perceptions—earthy yet strange, with neologistic touches (“Mossy delight,” “mulch of memory”) that feel world-specific rather than generic. Rhythm and diction modulate well as pressure increases, moving from patient description to tenser, more charged lines around the decoding and release. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion; the narrative maintains a coherent psychic distance throughout. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, marrying technical watchmaker precision with metaphorical thinking (“a constant hush that folded time like cloth,” “color green grown tired of itself”). Diction suits a reflective craftsman and stays within a plausible, character-colored register even at its most figurative. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the narrative modestly infers rather than omnisciently declaring, especially around the admiral’s motives. A few metaphors cluster close together, but they feel pattern-driven rather than like generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent: technical yet lyrical, with metaphors rooted in metallurgy and balance, e.g., “factually mystical as the tide tables we consult.” Diction and syntax feel plausibly like a precise, self-questioning alchemist rather than generic lyricism, and the collective “we” at the opening resolves cleanly into a stable focalizer stance. Rhythm modulates well, with longer sinuous sentences for reflection and sharper declaratives at key turns (“But I am a balanced alchemist, not a prophet, and balance is a jealous arithmetic.”). There’s no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the patterns taught early are honored through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., “fear has its manners when the sun is still negotiating dawn”). Lyric density is high but controlled; rhythms modulate well between longer, incantatory lines and sharper, decisive ones at turns. The metaphoric register stays coherent—water, sound, light, bone—so the voice feels unified rather than stitched. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrator’s sensibility anchors the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled blend of technical and lyrical diction that feels plausibly rooted in this character (proprioception, limits, equations alongside visceral trauma imagery). Psychic distance is well modulated: tight in bodily panic, slightly more reflective at the pool without losing immediacy. Patterns like “equations are the only prayers I was taught to trust” recur as voice, not scaffolding, and there’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience. The lyric compression never obscures who is perceiving or why.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, coherent lyric idiom—dense with metaphor yet anchored in the narrator’s role as translator of light and labor. POV distance is steady; we never slip into knowledge the narrator could not plausibly access, and reflective moments are clearly tethered to present stimuli. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, sinuous sentences in contemplative beats and slightly shorter, cleaner lines around key actions (unfastening, speaking names). Dialogue is sparse but effective, particularly the elder’s line about translation as “a bell rung home,” which aligns with and sharpens the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, blending technical precision (“horologist’s mainspring barrel,” “shafts and cables”) with ghostly lyricism (“weightless burden of anticipations not chosen”). Diction and imagery remain consistent with a narrator who is both a mechanic and someone intimately acquainted with lingering spirits, and the occasional dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and tonally aligned. Rhythm varies well, with clean, punchy sentences (“Dust is honest; it rests where air forgets to argue.”) punctuating longer, more sinuous lines. Under pressure, the voice doesn’t flatten or drift into exposition; it keeps filtering each event through the protagonist’s particular way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is consistently textured: metaphoric, tactile, and craft-inflected without slipping into generic lyricism. Perception is clearly the operator’s, with professional vocabulary (“platen,” “type,” “sheets are warm enough to take impression”) fused to emotional stakes, so the worldbuilding never feels like exposition. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, sinuous sentences for conceptual spans and sharper beats (“To set that pattern I had to loosen the press beyond regulation…”) at points of decision. The Glasswright’s sparse, cooler speech contrasts neatly with the narrator’s inwardly baroque register.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, marrying lush baroque diction with a revolutionary’s wary intelligence. Metaphors and perceptions (“time strings itself like harp wires,” “vault of walking seconds”) are particular to Neris’s role as poet-custodian in a temporally visible world. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both high-concept description and immediate procedural detail (how they dim lamps, sling the shard, cover mirrors) without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even legal and political language feels organically filtered through the same lyrical sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, musical, and consistently patterned, with inventive syntax and metaphor that feel of a piece (“like turning a page underwater,” “badge was a shadow”). POV is stable and coherent in a close, mythic third with occasional omniscient sweep, without disorienting slippage. Diction matches the fable-like, craft-saturated world and rarely strays into register clashes. The rhythmic control—alternating dense lyric sentences with cleaner narrative moves—keeps the piece legible despite its high figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is strong, consistent, and idiosyncratic, with a clear perceptual signature (“sensibly eccentric,” tuned to smell, pressure, and sound). Lyric density and syntactic rhythm are well controlled; the pattern is taught early and sustained without slipping into incoherence. The psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; even the explorers’ states are accessed via the psychometry conceit. Elevated diction feels congruent with this particular narrator rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strong, coherent, and distinctive, with inventive, character-inflected diction (“tastes like bitten nails,” “timewoven alliances”) that feels like a sculptor’s and storm-walker’s mind at work. POV control is tight; no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience intrudes, and psychic distance is modulated smoothly between sensory immediacy and reflective lyricism. Rhythms vary well, and the reverie mode is taught early and sustained through closure. The only check on a higher score is the constant high lyric pitch, which risks slight saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is assured, consistent, and distinctly that of a contemplative visual artist, with perceptions shaped by light, color, and surfaces. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, varying between longer lyrical sentences and tighter beats that keep the piece from drifting. The register never slips into abstraction divorced from the narrator’s sensibility, even when approaching philosophical territory. There is no POV leakage or confusion, and the modulation of voice toward the ending carries quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct archivist’s sensibility (“false colophons,” “civil-rights archivist assigned to reconcile”). POV control is tight; retrocognitive elements feel like extensions of Mara’s perception rather than omniscient leakage. Dialogue is sparse but distinctly voiced and purposeful, especially Esteban’s plainspoken admissions against Mara’s more textured narration. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the lyricism from becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet consistent with the character’s sensibility, with a distinct cadence and lexicon. Diction remains cohesive, threading technical (“kilns, cisterns”) with sensory and metaphoric language filtered through the alchemist’s craft and setting. The narrative distance is stable, with no head-hopping and a reliable, restrained stance that honors the “Tone: None” rule. Subtle modulation at key beats (storm, arrival of the women, final work-image) sharpens pressure without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and texturally controlled, blending liturgical precision with tactile, odd metaphors that feel native to this character’s mind. Diction (“the air puts on mourning gloves,” “sound has a rind”) is elevated but consistent with someone who lives inside archaic languages and ceremonial labor. Psychic distance remains stable; even reflective passages are anchored in present action and sensory detail, so lyricism never drifts into disembodied essay. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from curiosity to unease to grave resolve is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, blending scientific and mystical registers in a way that feels particular to this character. Diction (“Maxwell trick,” “lambent readiness,” “furiously tranquil”) and syntax create a recognizable rhythm without tipping into self-parody. Psychic distance stays stable; we are inside this mind’s perceptions and associations, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Under peak beats (the singing, the unlocking, the final tactile revelation), the voice tightens but does not flatten, sustaining its texture while carrying the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and technically controlled, with an engineer-mystic sensibility that feels coherent across the whole piece. Diction balances technical terms (“thermistors,” “strain gauges,” “split downdraft”) with metaphorical texture in a way that reads like this specific mind rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is stable and the narrative certainty matches what this character can plausibly infer; there is no head-hopping or stance wobble. The only minor limiter is a relatively uniform elevated register that could arguably compress further under peak stress, but it doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet coherent, with metaphors clearly rooted in this character’s sensibility (“cosmic janitor,” “world glows like a bruise that remembers healing”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate appropriately as pressure rises, particularly across the decommission sequence and storm. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift; even the more abstract lines feel anchored in the speaker’s way of thinking. The prose could likely sustain even more tonal variation under peak stress, but as is it’s already at a very high, publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person, close-lyric POV is stable with a distinct texture—associative, metaphor-rich, and attuned to tiny sensory and conceptual shifts. Diction (“mute eloquence,” “viscous archive of things left unsaid,” “letters of scent and pressure and patience”) feels like a coherent narrative intelligence rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance stays consistent; we’re inside Mara’s mode of perception without head-hopping and with no clumsy exposition. The elevated register occasionally skews more authorial than character-bound, but it suits the piece’s mythic-ritual ambitions and remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature built around synesthetic, textural noticing and aversion to numerals. The lyric register is consistent and believable for this narrator; psychic distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is evident in how sentences lengthen around reflection and tighten around key beats (the urn fragment’s click, the coin release). No dialogue is needed; interiority and observation carry the piece well.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the poet’s sensibility, with metaphors that feel native to this mind (“feather…curves like a question”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with more compressed, precise lines around the snap and lift of the kite. The limited dialogue is natural and understated, allowing subtext and image to carry meaning rather than exposition. POV boundaries are clear, with no head-hopping or implausible knowledge claims.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly distinctive: lyrical, technical, and wryly self-aware (“Some caretakers pray; I remodel.”). Diction and imagery feel plausibly rooted in a meticulous, dying caretaker’s mind, and the narrative distance is stable. Rhythm modulates well between dense description and declarative insight, carrying the lyric pattern without slipping into abstraction or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, blending scientific lexicon (“volatile memory,” “spectrometers,” “exchange constant”) with lyric perception in a way that feels character-driven, not generic. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with patterned metaphors (resin, dust, bronze, breath) taught early and sustained without confusion. POV distance is stable and plausible; even heightened phrases like “archivists of weather” read as this particular narrator’s mind. Under emotional pressure at the tower, the voice intensifies but does not fracture or over-explain.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in routes, funerals, treaties, and languages; diction like “narrow vastness” and “sentence of soil” feels cohesive rather than showy. Psychic distance and tense are stable, and the slight mythic elevation of register matches the character’s role as quasi-priest/coachman of memory. There is no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue with the veteran is spare and tonally aligned. At an elite standard, one could argue for a touch more modulation—occasional plainness to offset sustained ornateness—but the control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly textured, with a strong perceptual signature (“his ears were maps of old thunder”) that feels anchored in this character’s mind rather than generic lyricism. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with a pleasing mix of short, declarative lines and more sinuous sentences that match emotional temperature. POV distance stays stable and modest; we never slip into knowledge the narrator couldn’t plausibly have. Occasionally the diction edges toward uniformly elevated in a way that slightly blurs the narrator’s sociolect, but it doesn’t break credibility or control.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature that blends scientific precision and familial myth (“time dragging light as if mending it”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both lyric reflection and concrete action without confusion. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, tightening around the discovery and recalibration sequence. The absence of dialogue is appropriate to the solitude and never feels like an omission.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel specific to this narrator’s sensibility (“wind scraped our faces like a patient file,” “stars waved like kelp”). Kestrel’s idiom and behavior read as distinct from the narrator’s earnest interiority, especially in his “sacredly playful” bows and puckish handling of secrets. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close while allowing mythic phrasing without breaking plausibility. Rhythm modulates well across beats, supporting wonder and tension without sliding into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with rich but disciplined metaphor and a clear perceptual signature (“sirens made a crown for the horizon,” “edge of permission, in the swing of a door that never decided”). Lyric compression and non-standard formulations feel character-motivated and pattern-taught from the first line, and the piece maintains legibility despite density. The Custodian’s few spoken lines are spare, goal-driven, and tonally distinct, functioning as pressure rather than exposition. Under peak beats the rhythm tightens without losing clarity, showing strong command of psychic distance and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrically distinctive, and controlled, with metaphors that feel like the narrator’s habitual way of thinking rather than pasted-on ornament. The seer’s speech has a recognizable cadence—aphoristic but textured—that complements rather than merges with the narrator’s interiority. POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the voice modulates intensity appropriately around key beats (approaching the stone, the feather’s touch, the final offering). A few lines brush the edge of aphoristic over-clarity (“maps are only apologies for rooms we have not yet claimed”), but they stay anchored enough in character and situation to avoid feeling like authorial thesis intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature marrying chess concepts to textile and architectural imagery (“gleam of cold geometry,” “threads across the day, stitched taut”). Diction and rhythm remain controlled even under pressure, and psychic distance stays steady: reflective but not omniscient. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels earned by the character’s sensibility. The line-level music modulates appropriately as pressure rises toward the labyrinth’s opening.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (metaphor choices, attention to sound and structure). Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the collective “we” around the I-narrator is handled cleanly. Rhythm and diction support the accumulative mode, modulating into a more incantatory tone at the climax without losing clarity. The only minor check is that the rhetorical fluency under extreme stress is stylized to a degree that nudges believability, though it suits the fable/lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently close, lyrical, and tinted with the alchemist’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control (“He would rise, spit, and narrate the sequence aloud, so that air could hold what water tried to dissolve”). Diction and imagery feel unified—mechanical, alchemical, and oceanic—without slipping into anachronistic or academic registers. The narrative distance stays steady, never leaking into information the character couldn’t plausibly sense in this stylized world. The modulation from anxious uncertainty to quiet, hard-won relief at the end is smooth and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: he understands the world through surfaces, reflections, and nautical textures (“as if the horizon were a leash,” “the way an oar remembers its oarlock”). Psychic distance is steady; the lyric compression and patterned syntax are taught from the first lines and sustained without confusion. Diction stays coherent with this almost-mystic, solitary painter’s sensibility. There’s minimal modulation between calm and peak beats, but in this textural mode that restraint reads intentional rather than flat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive and consistent, marrying maritime concreteness with quasi-mystical perception (“the panes hum with the small, private vibrations of intent”). POV control is solid; we never leave the assistant’s consciousness, and inferred world rules all come through his beliefs and observations. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—the sentences soften and slow around the ritual, then tighten slightly as the skiff approaches—without losing texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Alder’s few verbal notes and described reactions feel tonally distinct from the narrator’s interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, specific, and consistently colored by the character’s occupation and grief (“my maps are scraps of other people, and my coat is sewn from promises”). Lyricism is controlled, with syntax and rhythm modulating between long, image-rich sentences and shorter, declarative pivots at moments of tactical action. POV boundaries are clean—Rowan’s perspective only arrives mediated through calls—and the narrator’s perceptual biases (toward signals, stars, and relics) never blur. The idiom feels unified and character-grounded rather than generically “poetic.”

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—scientific yet lushly metaphorical (“rational as rainfall,” “my mouth wore river stones”)—and remains consistent throughout. Lexicon and imagery match the character’s role and world, with no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm and syntax are well controlled, flexing between dense lyricism and clearer exposition as needed. The voice is memorable enough for elite venues, with only rare moments where high-concept phrasing brushes against abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, marked by a strong perceptual bias toward absence and metaphor (“a clock forgetting its numbers,” “the seam of the world unthreading”). POV control is tight; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated knowledge. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, lusher sentences in reflective beats and cleaner, more pointed ones at structural turns (the man’s collapse, the liner’s approach). The only caution is that the uniformly elevated diction risks feeling slightly authorial rather than fully inseparable from this specific keeper’s sociolect, though it still reads coherent for a reflective, solitary narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical yet grounded perceptual signature (maps as “surviving stars,” ants as ink returning to a well). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without losing coherence, maintaining a character-specific lens that blends empirical observation and intuitive metaphor. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; reflection is always anchored in immediate stimuli. The voice manages density and clarity simultaneously, sustaining a confident, singular narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive—ornate, slightly archaic, and consistently filtered through the queen’s sensibility (e.g., status-aware judgments like “lords flinch and fall, but queens enter and teach the dark”). POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the mapmaker’s few lines sound like him rather than the narrator. Rhythm modulates well, with long lyrical sentences in calm passages and tighter beats on key acts like renunciation and stitching the wound. The density of figurative language is high but controlled and pattern-consistent, not random flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“soup agreeing,” “numbers…like promises”). Diction comfortably supports the elevated scientific-mystical register while still allowing grounded, human touches in dialogue and sensory detail. POV is stable and well-controlled; we never slip outside the narrator’s knowledge or stance, and psychic distance modulates smoothly at key beats (e.g., during the secret). A few aphoristic lines flirt with sounding writerly rather than strictly character-bound, but they fit the established contemplative intelligence enough not to break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, fusing technical lucidity with wild metaphor in a way that feels intrinsic to a “lucid dream chronicler.” Diction and rhythm are controlled; images like “plumb line dropped through milk” and “jealousy is a magnet for loose iron” are surprising yet legible. The modulation from overtly lyrical to plainer, ledger-focused diction in the final dream and morning subtly tracks the narrator’s internal shift without dropping the established texture. Despite density, POV control remains tight and there is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, grounded in a former aromatherapist who now “listens” to water and rhythm, with diction and imagery tightly aligned to that identity. The narrative distance is stable, and the lyric compression feels controlled rather than vague. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the midwife’s tremor versus the narrator’s gentler, more metaphorical register marking clear distinctions. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around the repair and loosens slightly at the thematic close without any head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, sensorially dense, and consistent, with metaphors that feel specific to a rune scholar steeped in storms and ritual (“clouds gathered like librarians adjusting their sleeves”). Psychic distance stays stable, alternating smoothly between close perception and brief reflective turns anchored in present stimuli. Rhythm modulates with pressure—the held-breath sequence tightens, then opens after “Release” without losing texture. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even the elevated diction feels native to this narrator’s inner lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, metaphor-driven, and consistent with someone who “advises through metaphors,” giving the prose a coherent texture that feels lived rather than ornamental. Diction and rhythm shift with emotional intensity—the description tightens during the ritual and softens around the partial reconciliation. Mara’s few spoken lines and gestures read as a different, terser idiom, supporting clear POV boundaries and status dynamics. At moments the density of imagery risks feeling uniformly lush, where a few plainer beats might have sharpened the contrasts even more.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and idiosyncratic—phrases like “wanderingly exact” and “a thin ladder of senses, each a rung of air” feel specific to this mind. The diction sustains a high, lyrical register that matches the metaphysical frame without drifting into academic jargon or wobbling in tense or stance. Psychic distance is well-controlled: close enough to track interior shifts, far enough to allow patterned, ritualistic description. Purposeful elision around mechanics (how exactly the library slid sideways) is acceptable because the emotional and conceptual through-line remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent: lyrical yet mechanical, with a perceptual signature that moves naturally between hydraulics, weather, and metaphysical musing. Diction and syntax fit an introspective, technically competent worker; phrases like “capillary sleeves” and “a glacier…found a new throat” feel of a piece rather than stitched. Rhythm modulates well between long, imagistic lines and shorter, declarative beats at moments of decision (“I slid the mantle clock key into a stubborn petcock…”). It’s publish-ready at a very high level, held below 9 only by global gating rather than voice issues.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and distinct: metaphors (“electrical dark,” “quiet wildfire traveling under frost”) feel character-specific to someone steeped in both tech and wet systems. POV is stable, and psychic distance modulates smoothly between sensory immediacy and reflective patterning without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Ren, Mira, and the narrator each carrying subtly differentiated cadences; speech advances both plot and subtext. The density of figurative language is high yet patterned from the outset, so it reads as deliberate voice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture: analytic yet sensory, using probabilistic and mapping metaphors in a way that feels organic to her profession and psychology. Diction and rhythms modulate with pressure (e.g., the clipped worry around his uneaten meal versus the more expansive library description) without breaking the voice. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext (“You followed the markers,” calling carrots lucky) and advancing relationship stakes. There are no POV slips or unwarranted omniscience; even the father’s beliefs are filtered through what she knows of him.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and textured, with metaphor and syntax clearly belonging to this mind (e.g., “a goodbye could listen to itself and decide which syllable to keep”). Lyric compression is well-controlled; patterned diction (“between the hum of streetlamps”) is taught early and reprised meaningfully. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance is steady—reflective yet anchored in tactile actions (spinning the disc, looping wires). The only small limiter is that the lyric register is very uniform, so modulation under peak-pressure moments is more tonal than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by profession and grief (attention to ink, ledgers, nuance of gesture and texture). Syntax and diction modulate smoothly with emotional intensity, and the few lines of dialogue feel grounded and understated, serving as action rather than exposition. The registral level—poetic, metaphor-dense—is justified by the character’s role and context and doesn’t waver into jarring academic or flat colloquial tones. It falls just short of the very top tier because the lyricism is fairly uniform, with minimal rhythmic roughness or fracture at peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—densely metaphorical, patterned (“polite anarchy,” “desperately jocular”), and rhythmically controlled. Third-person focalization remains stable, and the narration’s figurative reach feels aligned with Mara’s oblique, systems-minded way of seeing the world. Recurrent phrasings (“like anarchy remembering its manners,” “like a whisper adjusting its coat”) feel like deliberate motif rather than tic. Under pressure (the rumor’s launch, the queue forming), the voice tightens without losing coherence or slipping into a different register.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyric, and sensorially particular to a blind character who “absorbs languages through skin.” Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, incantatory rhythm without sliding into abstraction or register drift. The narrative distance is steady and apt for an accumulative, ritual-like journey, with no POV slippage. The voice’s richness sustains pressure and clarity through the climax and reprise of the ring and blaze.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently filtered through a mind used to cosmic metaphors (“smoke that forgot it was once fire,” “her voice a lantern”). POV is stable and credible for a poetic yet technical interpreter; the one brief dialogue exchange with Mara feels natural, with her lighter tone subtly contrasting the narrator’s gravity. Patterned lyricism is taught from the opening line and sustained without confusing the action. Under pressure, the voice modulates rather than flattens, keeping both clarity and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and lyrically particular, with a strong perceptual signature (mathematical tides, musical silences, hands as language). The advisor’s presence is rendered largely through action and sign-description, keeping POV tight while giving her a distinct aura. Rhythm and diction modulate well: sentences lengthen into lush description where pressure is textural, then tighten around key turns (the police launch, “Home, he repeats”). There’s no POV leakage or register drift; figurative language feels native to this mind.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, blending analytical precision with surreal metaphor in a way that feels idiosyncratic to this character. Diction and syntax stay coherent under pressure, with controlled rhythmic variation (“Patterns whisper; smoke graphs its own arguments; desire computes trajectories even numbers envy”) and no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, especially Mira’s line about listening to flames, which carries layered subtext and emotional weight without over-explaining. The lyric intensity is high throughout; a bit more modulation between rapture and plainness might sharpen contrast, but the stance never becomes confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctively lyrical yet emotionally grounded, with tactile, idiosyncratic perceptions (“like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea”) that feel character-specific rather than generic-poetic. POV remains clean and consistent; even the more abstract lines are anchored in her embodied experience. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, tightening around the consent moment and the walk with Jonah without losing clarity. The lyric compression and patterned metaphors are taught early and maintained with control through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, mixing technical familiarity (“drain holes,” “cams”) with lyrical metaphor (“the cranes mutter like old men,” “sound ran downhill”). Psychic distance is steady and appropriate; we remain inside the worker’s perception without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and diction flex with pressure but maintain a clear signature, and the brief dialogue from Otero and the implied teen feels tonally consistent. At times the lyricism could risk over-saturation, but it stays controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and coherent from start to finish, with a distinctive perceptual signature (city and canal filtered through vows, instruments, and text-like metaphors). Rhythm and syntax are controlled, balancing long, sinuous sentences with occasional sharper beats around key actions (“A hand surfaced first…”). The narrative distance remains stable and plausible for a quasi-mystic guardian; we are inside a mind that genuinely experiences the world as patterns of light and silence. Its only limitation is a slight sameness of elevated register that could risk blurring micro-shifts in emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically consistent and distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to quiet sounds, subtle pressures, and game metaphors. The conceit of “hearing unspoken words” is woven into the narration without breaking POV logic, lending a slight fabulist tilt that matches the grotto’s magnetism. Rhythm is well-controlled, with varied sentence lengths and recurring phrases that feel patterned rather than mechanical. The only minor drawback is that the voice’s high lyric register is nearly uniform, with little modulation in moments that might benefit from sharper, plainer contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (marine metaphors, labor-inflected tenderness). Rhythm and syntax flex with emotional intensity, and the lyric compression never loses track of who knows what. Sparse dialogue (“Fight the tide gently, and let it win”) is in-character and subtext-rich. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the voice carries both the worldbuilding and the thematic load gracefully.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice is highly controlled and distinctive, with metaphor and syntax that feel particular to this character’s theatrical, slightly ironic mind. His spoken narration of tasks reads differently from the descriptive prose yet shares a tonal DNA, and the inspector’s sparse lines carry subtext and restraint. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, supporting the lyric, accumulative mode without becoming monotonous. The only small reservation is that the density of figurative language approaches saturation in places, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is a standout: controlled, musical, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“lantern-moth hush,” “temperered hands,” “granular with new permission”) that feels organic to this world. POV stance is stable and confident, allowing conceptual moves without losing concrete footing. Rhythm modulates effectively, using sentence length and image density to pace the build from quiet expectation to charged, almost liturgical closure. The lyric register never slips into unmotivated jargon or explanatory prose; it remains an embodied, architecturally aware consciousness throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent with a distinct perceptual signature: it favors tactile, value-and-weight-based noticing that aligns with a colorblind painter’s bias. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty as image and concept without slipping into abstraction. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; even when the narration zooms to “the city understands,” it feels like a controlled widening consistent with the piece’s mythic register. The diction is elevated but stable, never jolting into an alien register.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent, sensuous lexicon (“sleeping bellows,” “prismatic throats,” “unblamed flower”) that feels organic to a sound-obsessed ritualist. POV control is steady; the narrator never knows more than she plausibly could, and brief quoted dialogue is natural and subtextually aligned with the themes. Rhythm varies well, with long lyric sentences balanced by clean declaratives that keep the prose from becoming sludge. The lyric register is high but doesn’t drift into academic or pseudo-mystical jargon, maintaining credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with precise, metaphorically dense diction that feels coherent with a jeweler-artist steeped in grief and ritual. POV is stable and modest in what it claims to know, using inference and sensory detail rather than omniscient pronouncements. Rhythm modulates well, with long, lyric sentences in reflective stretches and shorter, grounded ones at key turns (placing lockets, seeds swelling) to maintain clarity. There is virtually no dialogue to test, but the narration’s texture and selective attention function as character and world-building simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent—lyric but precise, with patterned metaphors that feel like this narrator’s particular way of thinking (“rivers braid silt into islands,” “thread was constellations waiting to be stitched”). The cartomancer’s speech has its own crisp, slightly oracular pragmatism, creating clear tonal contrast in dialogue. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both macro reflection and immediate tactile beats without confusion. Occasionally the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, but it remains coherent with the chosen lyric mode and post-crash, quasi-mystic analytic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and unmistakable: highly metaphorical yet internally consistent and clearly rooted in a particular mind (“the rhythm of refusing to be a drum,” “gardens from before the water bans”). Psychic distance is well controlled; even abstract sentences feel grounded in her embodied perception and stakes. There is no head-hopping and no register drift; the elevated diction is justified by her role and milieu. The only small limiter is that the voice holds one intense register almost throughout, with little modulation into plainer textures that might sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and stable—lyric, image-dense, yet always filtered through this particular dusk noticer’s sensibility and occupational lens. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, creating a slow, deliberate cadence that tightens around key beats (the reels, the stone-circuit, the binding) without becoming monotonous. Perceptual signature is strong: metaphors are world-consistent (petals, clouds, light, film, stone) and never break POV plausibility. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and patterned elision is taught from the first line and held through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly rooted in this specific handler’s perceptions (wood talking back through grain, receipts sifted like part of care-work). Diction and metaphor choices feel cohesive across the piece, and the modulation from atmospheric description to moral calculus is smooth. Karim’s sparse on-page speech is filtered, but his presence and status shifts are legible through her lens. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the narrative trusts imagery and implication to carry much of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct and consistent, with a controlled lexicon of weather, glass, roots, scars, and rings that feels like this particular mind. Telepathic plant speech is handled in the same lyrical register yet remains distinguishable in texture (“green rain, shy and certain”), avoiding jarring register shifts. POV boundaries are clean; all knowledge is plausibly anchored in the narrator’s perceptions and the plants’ communications. The only slight limitation is that the lushness is nearly uniform in intensity, leaving little rhythmic contrast between calmer and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinctive, with an almost occult technical register (“alphabet of silver,” “topography made of sprocket holes”) that fits the character’s role. POV is stable and filters every image through the narrator’s particular perception; even the manager is seen in terms that reflect the narrator’s concerns. Rhythm and diction modulate well, with longer, lusher sentences giving way to slightly sharper declaratives at key turns (“Unused love is stored in the clear head of the reel”). The only restraint on a higher score is that the voice stays in one lyrical gear; there’s little modulation toward rawness under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature in phrases like “star-salted mantle” and “their beaks sealed with midnight wax.” Diction and rhythm are controlled, modulating into slightly plainer, colder language around the recognition of cost. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the mystical register feels intrinsic to this character’s mind rather than imposed. At times the density of ornament edges toward uniformity, but it remains legible and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to the guard yet lyrically omniscient in scope, with a distinct texture of railwork, quantum language, and lullaby imagery. Phrases like “It is a trick he learned from silence, how a person can smear across places through wave functions and still be alone” showcase a strong perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The integration of technical diction (“wave functions,” “superposition,” “interference”) into the mythic tone is confident and feels voice-motivated rather than grafted on. Psychic distance is stable, and the experimental lyric mode is taught early and maintained through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses mechanical and organic imagery (“coinlight,” “seed of rustless sunrise,” “syntax of thunder”). POV distance is steady; we never slip out of this consciousness or into unmotivated omniscience. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence length and sound-play supporting the recursive, spiral logic of the setting and the quest. The only thing holding it back from the absolute top band is occasional uniformity of high-lyric register, which could benefit from one or two sharper, plainer pivots for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, sensorial, and consistent, with lyric but controlled diction that feels like one mind experiencing a liminal ordeal. Recurrent phrasings (“through indirect routes,” “after the leash breaks”) and sea/sky metaphors are pattern-taught early and used as structural devices rather than affect-only ornament. Psychic distance is managed well: the narration stays close to immediate perception while allowing occasional conceptual lifts that match the ritual atmosphere. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the modulation from awe to fear to quiet resolve is fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., “twilight tea,” “voices held in escrow to pay for safety”). The diction is elevated but believable for a reflective, traumatized narrator and remains stable under emotional pressure. Silence, gesture, and small physical beats carry subtext effectively, especially in the bellhop’s non-verbal questions and his refusal to ring the bell. The modulation from awe to ethical clarity to a poised, fragile hope is smooth, with no POV leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent metaphorical palette (books, ink, dust, constellations, recipes) that feels like one sensibility observing everything. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences that vary length and structure while maintaining clarity. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext (the pretender’s “improved our story” line encapsulates his entire philosophy). The slight omniscient tilt never wavers into head-hopping or explanatory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in technical familiarity and quiet melancholy. Scientific terms (“hydrograph charts,” “nodal nod”) sit naturally alongside metaphor (“tides still rehearse old griefs”) in a way that feels character-appropriate rather than showy. Psychic distance is steady and well-modulated; even reflective passages stay anchored in present sensations or micro-actions (tapping, reading, logging). There is no head-hopping or register drift, and Jun’s presence is cleanly mediated through the narrator’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature that marries technical awareness to mystical attentiveness (“every rusted bolt a performer, every loose cable a trembling understudy”). Diction and rhythm feel intentional and character-appropriate for a contemplative, technically literate rebel. Psychic distance stays consistent, and the narrative never slips into unearned omniscience. The only brake on a higher score is occasional proximity to over-poeticism, though it remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent: lush, metaphor-rich, yet precise, with a strong perceptual signature in how Mara relates plants, minerals, and ritual. Lyric techniques (repetition of “During the reconstruction…,” parallel phrasing, extended metaphors) are patterned and purposeful, not ornamental, and they modulate well with escalating stakes. There is no POV slippage; even quasi-omniscient touches (botanists’ muttering, plant speech) feel anchored in Mara’s lived reality. Rhythm varies nicely, with long sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter clauses around key decisions, giving the piece a confident, publishable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture calibrated to Samira’s perception, with sustained, coherent metaphor (“glass ribcage,” “camera smile,” “spray swaggering”). Occasional collective “we” in the opening gracefully yields to a stable Samira-focused lens without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with lines like “we are listening to it” crystallizing stakes and subtext economically. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—more compressed and bodily around freeze moments, more expansive around ceremonial reflections—without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrically dense yet coherent, with a strong perceptual signature in its sea-and-light metaphors, personified weather, and metaphysical yet tactile diction (“fogbones of the day,” “messy theology of maintenance”). POV is tight and consistent, never slipping outside the artist’s sensibility, and psychic distance modulates smoothly between close embodiment and reflective abstraction. Syntax and rhythm vary in a controlled way, sustaining musicality without becoming monotonous. A few images push toward saturation, but they remain legible and voice-true rather than feeling like generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature (wind, sand, time, and machinery constantly cross-wired in metaphor) that stays coherent under pressure. Diction such as “attention vectors,” “metronome and mirror,” and “consciously wild” feels intrinsic to this character’s blend of feral tracker and precise experimentalist. POV distance remains stable, with no leakage or unexplained omniscience; reflective passages are anchored in immediate sensory triggers and choices. The rhythm varies well enough to avoid monotony, even with high figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically patterned, and consistent, marked by metaphors that blend organic and mechanical (“time reduced to a breathing machine,” “catalogs ticked with slow light”). POV remains tight to the archivist’s perception without leaks or unjustified omniscience. The single spoken line from the shadow and its reception maintain the story’s oblique, subtext-rich tone. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure, moving from contemplative to quietly electric as systems wake and the network flares.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent in its metaphoric logic (“quiet…cut deep enough to hold a pattern,” “smelling of turbine smoke and an unsettled map”). Lyric compression is taught from the opening line and sustained through the storm without losing clarity of action or spatial sense. The diction and imagery feel organically tied to this specific consciousness—part desert farmer, part ex-bounty hunter’s child—rather than to a generic poetic register. Under peak stress, the voice maintains its rhythm without collapsing into abstraction, which is a high level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-lyric POV is stable and distinctive, with a powerful rhythmic signature (“unhurried as a stone teaching water to wait”) that remains controlled across the piece. Diction and metaphor are consistently filtered through this mythic, acoustically-minded consciousness; there’s no register drift or explanatory intrusion. The voice modulates effectively as pressure rises (e.g., when the echo “sang a feral lullaby into his blood”), tightening without losing clarity. This is publishable-level voice work; only a slight saturation risk in the density of figures keeps it from the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, blending journalistic metaphors with cosmic imagery in a way that feels character-specific. POV is steady and controlled; we never leave her perceptual frame even as the prose grows figurative. Rhythms modulate well with intensity, tightening around the deletion scene and relaxing slightly in the dawn coda. Dialogue is sparing but functional, revealing status dynamics and evasions without expository clunk.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and suited to the surreal premise, with an effective blend of technical and poetic lexicon (“firmware,” “meteor hush,” “fed new bones”). POV control is clean; interior access never drifts into authorial explanation, and the lyric density stays tethered to this character’s sensibility as a “constellation tattooist” ex-audio translator. Rhythmic modulation is generally strong, with some lines functioning as precise gut-punches. Occasionally the sustained lushness risks smoothing over peaks, but it never slips into confusion or register-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyrical, metaphor-driven, and consistent with a perceptive, slightly off-kilter artist who “listens backward.” Diction and rhythm are controlled; the accumulation of unusual images feels patterned rather than random, and the narrative distance stays stable. Dialogue is sparse but apt, carrying subtext (“Your memory wants a banister”) and fitting the dreamlike register of the piece. Under pressure, the voice modulates into slightly sharper, clearer phrasing without breaking its established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (stones, ash, naming, and bodily metaphors recur in a patterned way). Diction and rhythm are controlled, shifting gracefully from imagistic narration to spare, effective dialogue (“law has no hands”) without register clash. The limited interior access and time-bent retrospection stay coherent; the narrator never knows more than their position allows, even as they interpret. Under stress, the voice retains its texture without becoming muddled, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person ghost voice is distinct, confident, and sustained, with a strong perceptual signature (“I taste footsteps, I see the pitch of silence”) and controlled lyricism. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative never leaks into an authorial register that breaks the conceit. Synesthetic metaphors are varied yet coherent, building a recognizable internal logic rather than feeling random or generic. At times the density of ornament skirts the edge of over-lushness, but it remains legible and pattern-consistent, supporting rather than obscuring the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“willowglass hope made mineral,” “a small, patient train”). POV is tightly held without leakage; what the narrator knows and infers feels plausible for someone in this body and craft. Dialogue is sparse but efficient and in-character, especially Mara’s concise, consent-focused lines. Rhythmic control under pressure is excellent, with sentences modulating in length and texture to suit experimentation, discovery, and the quiet landing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and technically precise, marrying scientific lexicon (“trace gases,” “microfaunal tremors”) with numinous perception (“veins like frozen rivers of a vanished canopy”). POV distance stays stable and intimate, with interior reflections always anchored to immediate stimuli and actions. Rhythmic control is excellent: long sinuous sentences for perception, tighter ones for physical constraint or surge. The invented professional idiom (sensory map maker, dream loops) feels organic to this mind rather than expository.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on time, cloth, buttons, and echoes. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, sustaining a lyric register that feels native to this character’s sensibility rather than generic “poetic” prose. The piece manages compressed, reflective passages without losing spatial or emotional anchoring, and there’s no POV leakage or cheap elision. It just misses the very top band because the high lyricism is almost uniform; a slight modulation in texture at peak pressure might have added even more dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinct yet controlled, with a recognizably spy-hardened sensibility beneath the metaphors. Diction and rhythm stay consistent, and the few dialogue lines are natural, character-specific, and subtextual (“the kind you wear when you expect to leave it behind”). The perceptual signature—seeing weather, objects, and even apology as coded—is strong and stable. Elision is minimal and purposeful, never confusing time, knowledge, or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically heightened yet coherent, with a clear perceptual signature that favors water, fabric, and time metaphors (“rain stitched the eaves,” “letters would not keep still”). POV is stable and modest about knowledge, never slipping into omniscience, and psychic distance modulates smoothly with emotional intensity. Dialogue is spare but effective, each line doing thematic and structural work without sounding expository. The pattern of figurative language is taught early and sustained, so the density reads as deliberate music rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is exquisitely controlled: metaphor-rich but coherent, with a clear perceptual signature (attuned to texture, craft, and subtle movement in light and earth). Diction and syntax stay consistent with a contemplative, craftsman narrator; phrases like “sharp gentleness” and “the air learned that shape of kindness” feel anchored in her sensibility rather than imposed. Psychic distance is stable: we inhabit her thinking closely without head-hopping or explanatory scaffolding, and the lyric compression is taught from line one and never dropped. Modulation—slight quickening around discover-and-test beats, then a widening calm at the end—serves the emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and coherent, blending technical specificity (“lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth”) with soft, idiosyncratic metaphor in a way that feels character-bound rather than authorial. The perceptual signature—naming textures of light, rhythm, and breath—is consistent from start to finish and modulates subtly as pressure rises (more tactile focus around the lock and net). Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-rich (e.g., Mr Alvarez’s line about bribing a saint, Theo’s silent test of the stairwell). There is no head-hopping or register drift; psychic distance is handled confidently.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and coherent, with a consistent lexicon of tides, stone, and cloudlight that feels native to this consciousness. Lyric compression and metaphor density are high but patterned and legible, never slipping into unmotivated abstraction or expository handholding. POV remains tight and steady; even when summarizing past winters, the narration stays grounded in present triggers (ledger, hum) and current stakes. There’s minor risk of tonal sameness in the elevated register, but rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose alive.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature that melds craft metaphors (“keeper of secrets with ink on my fingers”) with attention to small natural geometries. When dialogue appears, it’s brief, understated, and in keeping with the meditative tone, advancing stakes rather than explaining them. Psychic distance is controlled; even reflective lines are anchored in present stimuli (the nest, the temple, the crowd). The rhythmic control—alternating lush sentences with shorter, declarative ones—supports emotional beats without drifting into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, mixing technical lexicon with numinous metaphor in a way that feels like this particular engineer-artist narrator: “the antenna tower hums like a spine,” “thin frost across the noise floor.” POV control is tight; even broad assertions about tricksters and power plays sound like the narrator’s seasoned interpretation rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and syntax are varied and intentional, with sentence lengths modulating to suit pressure (lyric sprawl in set-up, tighter clauses during the node sequence). Occasional aphoristic lines flirt with essayistic register, but overall the voice is coherent, memorable, and stable under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with lines like “I prefer open lies to tight truths” clearly stamped as this narrator’s way of thinking. POV control is steady; we never leave her lens, and the register stays aligned with a reflective, slightly obsessive explorer accustomed to strange geometry. Rhythm modulates well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter, grounded ones at points of choice. The lyricism never collapses into vagueness, which is difficult at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close on Lio has a vivid, consistent perceptual signature—he maps voices, breath, and texture rather than faces, and the prose’s cadenced, almost metronomic rhythm matches his method. Diction is elevated but character-consistent; phrases like “woolen quiet of fog” or “temperature of grief” feel like his inner language, not authorial intrusion. Dialogue is spare yet loaded with subtext, especially the captain’s shift from professional cadence to fragmented confession. POV boundaries are respected, with no head-hopping, and brief inferences about the captain’s breath and training stay within what Lio can plausibly sense.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility as both librarian and exile, with rich metaphoric perception (“boots feel too loud,” “bargain like mud that hardens as you stand”). POV remains stable and modest in knowledge, with no head-hopping. Mirek’s few spoken lines feel in-character and carry subtext about bureaucracy and fear. The lyric density feels character-driven rather than generic, even if it occasionally brushes the edge of writerly flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent perceptual signature—richly metaphorical, dynamically noticing textures like “gullies shaped like sleeping faces” and “plastic handwriting.” Dialogue, though sparse, feels tuned to this world; the fiddler’s lines (“pixelated amnesty,” “spans have souls”) sound like an extension of his mythic vocation rather than authorial intrusion. POV control is clean and stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. Rhythmic modulation—the alternation of long, lush sentences and tighter, action-oriented lines—supports emotional peaks and the quiet, charged ending.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent—lyric, slightly ironic, with a tech-founder’s lexicon (“reputational gravity,” “geofences”) braided into almost elegiac observation. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing compression of years without losing immediacy, and the brief dialogue with the kid is tonally apt and character-distinct. Patterned phrases around calm, circles, and markers feel deliberate rather than mechanical. Minor check: the density of figurative language occasionally risks smoothing emotional spikes, which is why this lands just under the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently lyrical, with metaphors that feel native to a “lucid dream chronicler” who thinks in cross-sensory images (“petals still smelled like copper dawn”). Psychic distance is well handled: the narration stays anchored in the observatory’s present while dipping into reflection only when it sharpens the current choice or perception. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, with Mara’s few lines carrying subtext (“The inscriptions describe a ritual of attention”) and the narrator’s speech clearly differentiated by softness and intention. The only restraint on a higher score is that the register holds a uniformly elevated lyricism even under emotional spikes; a touch more modulation might sharpen some turns.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct—lyric but martial, with repeated attention to discipline, armor, and tactical calm. Diction (“unbend,” “expanding circles of thought,” “as if setting spear to shield”) feels organic to Issa’s mindset and the story’s magic system. Psychic distance is managed well; we are close enough to taste her bile and self-reproach without drifting into expository explanation. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though in a few places the lyricism approaches the edge of over-density.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and plausibly heightened for a visionary rooted to a living glade; its diction and metaphoric habits feel like a coherent psyche rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is controlled, letting us inhabit both sensory strangeness and conceptual framing (“movement here is not a step but a seam”) without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the girl’s lines sounding simpler and more shaken than the narrator’s braided narration. At times, the density of abstraction risks flattening modulation, but the emotional contour remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and textured, with a strong perceptual signature (“stories grow where water listens,” “a grove became a bruise”). Dialogue is stylized but coherent with the mythic register, and the Keeper’s lines carry clear status and worldview. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the lyric compression never breaks POV plausibility within this fantastical frame. The uniform elevation of diction leaves little modulation between high-pressure and quieter beats, which slightly narrows expressive range.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinct: technical yet haunted, with a sonic lexicon and dry humor (“coffee old enough to have a pension”) that feel lived-in. POV is stable and modest, never claiming knowledge beyond his perceptions, and shifts in distance are controlled as he moves between present-tense tasks and vividly anchored memories. Lark’s few lines of dialogue carry a different cadence and register, marking her as a separate presence. Lyric density never quite tips into obscurity; the rhythm remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is singular, controlled, and consistent, blending technical precision with numinous metaphor in a way that feels plausibly like this specific cuneiform translator. Lexicon (“wedges,” “magnet lines,” “gradients”) and image-patterns repeat with variation, creating a recognizable perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well-handled: close enough for interior nuance, far enough to sustain lyric compression without confusion. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and rhythm modulates deftly from incantatory to sharply observational at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“tide chart written on brass ribs,” “parliament of moths whose letters had grown tired”). Diction and rhythm are controlled; the surreal register feels intrinsic to the narrator rather than imposed ornament. Limited snippets of dialogue are natural within this stylized world and serve to reveal character rather than undercut voice. Psychic distance remains stable despite the dense metaphor, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a strong perceptual signature (“latently radiant” stone, doctrines as chains, hopes as condensate). Psychic distance stays consistent, and there is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; even the cave’s “voice” is mediated through perception and metaphor. Rhythm and syntax are varied and attuned to emotional beats, expanding in reflective moments and tightening around the hesitation and crowning. The elevated diction matches the character’s reflective, quasi-mystical orientation, so it doesn’t read as register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, self-lacerating, river-obsessed—and remains consistent in register with the persona of a “truth-seeking river chronicler” who has used jargon as a shield. Diction choices (“rosy article,” “ghost badges,” “charged as blunt as river stones”) feel character-specific rather than generic poeticizing. Psychic distance is well-managed; reflective moves are anchored in concrete stimuli (graffiti, mirror, busker’s music) and keep us in the present pressure. The busker’s minimal dialogue and implied judgment are tonally apt and avoid breaking the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature built around delay, echoes, and veiling; metaphors feel curated to the consciousness on the page. The lyrical register stays plausible for this dreamlike, introspective narrator and modulates gently with pressure without slipping into abstraction-induced opacity. There is purposeful elision but no head-hopping or stance confusion, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. It’s a strong, publication-ready voice for this mode, just shy of the absolute top tier in sheer rhythmic daring.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is supple, coherent, and immediately distinctive, marrying curatorial precision with surreal, plant-mediated perception. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—more incantatory around the coffee-stain vision and the performance, more declarative at the key decision beats. The lyric density feels character-true rather than generic “poetic” register. POV boundaries are clear: we never slip into others’ minds, only into what the plants communicate to her.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, steady, and appropriate to a ritual specialist, with a controlled lyricism that feels like this character’s mind rather than generalized “poetic” prose. Perceptual choices—how she notices hair, oils, stone, and light—are consistently character-specific and align with her occupation. Psychic distance is held well; we never slip into information she couldn’t plausibly infer. The main risk is that the register stays uniformly elevated, with little modulation in syntax or diction at peak stress, but it still reads as intentional, meditative control rather than flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, measured, and lyrical without losing clarity; diction like “vineyard hush,” “scallop the clay basins,” and “letting time pour and not chasing it” feels specific to this character’s mind. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflective compression that matches the contemplative mode. There’s no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue with the pilgrim fits the established rhythm. The voice modulates subtly with pressure (e.g., around the mother and the fire) while keeping its contemplative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphors that feel like a specific mind’s way of seeing (“a gull pretends to be a thought,” “oysters speaking in coded clicks”). Psychic distance is steady, and the occasional dialogue lines are natural and subtextual, aligned with each character’s goals. The narrative pattern—image-laden observation braided with precise ethical framing—is taught early and sustained without wobble. It doesn’t quite hit 9+ only because there’s minimal modulation into rougher or more fractured rhythms at peak stress; the voice stays beautifully smooth even as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, consistent lyric texture—sensory-rich, metaphor-driven, observant in ways that fit someone drawn to this researcher and place. The researcher’s spoken lines are sparser, more measured, and feel appropriate to a careful, withholding scientist-mystic. POV stays clean with no head-hopping; temporal handling within the trance is legible. Occasional density of poetic abstractions presses close to purple, but rhythm and control mostly prevent drift into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent: “historically reverent,” grounded in sonic and archival metaphors (ledgers, audits, liturgy) that match the character’s calling. Diction and syntax maintain a lyrical, slightly ritualized register while remaining legible, and metaphors feel coherent to this speaker’s mind rather than generically poetic. The modulation from observational calm to more charged negotiation with the pulse is handled through rhythm and image density, not register breaks. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; the perceptual signature (listening to refusal and echo) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrically observant, and clearly individuated as this mage’s mind rather than a generic poetic narrator. Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity—more compressed at choices (unstrapping the pack) and more expansive around perception (mist, light, frost). The perceptual signature (e.g., “moonmilk,” “brilliant dimness,” “handmade silence”) is distinctive without drifting into incoherence or head-hopping. It just stops shy of 9+ because the high lyricity is almost uniform, leaving little dynamic contrast in texture at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a strong perceptual signature—synesthetic, image-driven, and consistent from harbor to wreck (“a library leaned on its side as if reading in bed”). Diction and rhythm are controlled; metaphors feel curated rather than automatic, and psychic distance is steady. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the few external statements (“my foreman said…”) still feel like part of the same interior music. Under peak beats, the voice tightens rather than frays, maintaining clarity despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is cohesive, lyrical, and distinctly patterned, with metaphors and syntax consistently reflecting a measured, ritual-minded consciousness. Diction is elevated but plausible for this quasi-mystic technician, and the patterned elisions (e.g., “dawn that is not dawn”) are taught early and remain legible. The modulation from descriptive stillness to slightly heightened cadence around the coin casts and final tuning works without losing clarity. At times, the uniform lyric register risks smoothing over moment-to-moment emotional spikes, but overall the POV control and rhythmic texture are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and textured, with a strong perceptual signature (cosmic/technical vocabulary braided with bodily grief metaphors). Lyric compression and unusual comparisons mostly remain grounded in the narrator’s sensibility and never slip into an incoherent register. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping; even when referencing others, the voice stays rooted in the reaper’s consciousness. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively to highlight key beats like naming Enough.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct texture (“thin as regret and twice as strong,” “a plausible impossibility you can catch on the tongue”) that feels anchored in Nera’s sensibility. POV distance is stable, and even when we briefly ride Aro’s perception (“he is sure, the sea clear its throat”) the focalization remains coherent and non-jarring. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual—his “shrine to failure” line and her “not the body, but the moment” exchange carry status, guilt, and worldview. Rhythm and diction are consistent, never slipping into expository or prosy register.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific, blending professional vigilance with a storyteller’s metaphorical eye (“a moth wing of glassless memory,” “buckets of silence”). POV control is clean; we never leave her consciousness, and inference never reaches beyond what she could plausibly know. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-rich, particularly the white-haired woman’s lines about keeping the town’s memories. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively between stillness and small surges of realization without losing the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through this particular mind—an alchemist who thinks in ratios, breath, and pattern. Syntax and diction are controlled, with pleasing rhythmic variation and a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “their dark commas curved and curved, an airborne syntax”). Occasional aphoristic sentences read as her own philosophical register rather than authorial intrusion, maintaining POV integrity. It’s elegant and memorable, though not quite so formally audacious as to justify a 9+ under this rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—technical yet lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in pattern and pressure (“fear…is the change in rhythm you ignore until the rhythm ignores you back”). Diction, syntax, and metaphor feel consistent with a hyper-attentive, seasoned watcher, and brief dialogue from Lio contrasts by being simpler and more immediate under stress. POV control is steady; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and reflection is well-anchored to present stimuli. The voice maintains clarity despite density, and cadence modulates effectively between tense beats and reflective after-action notes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistently lyric without slipping into generic abstraction; phrases like “my balance finally stopped arguing” and “numbness was the quiet court” exemplify a strong perceptual signature. The narrator’s knowledge and stance feel plausible for someone post–ego death in a surreal legal-mystic world, and psychic distance is controlled despite compression. Rhythmic control is high: sentence lengths and images modulate with emotional peaks (especially around the jar and the verdict). The only minor restraint is that the narrator’s diction and the sensei’s world-philosophy occasionally blur into a shared idiom, slightly flattening distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, blending occupational detail (“designs puzzles like weather systems”) with an almost devotional regard for possibility. Diction and metaphor feel unified with the character’s sensibility and never drift into an alien register, and the psychic distance is well controlled as it moves between concrete tasks and reflective insight. Recurrent phrasing (“storm-born silence,” “hush of a possibility”) creates a taught pattern rather than mechanical repetition. No POV slippage or explanatory overreach undercuts trust.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is strikingly distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature that fuses technical ritual language and numinous metaphor (“physician of weather,” “a throat rehearsing apologies”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure, moving from stately to slightly more urgent without losing control. The diction feels native to this odd professional consciousness and never lapses into generic lyricism; the pattern is taught early and maintained. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the POV is confident and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—“half cat and half catalog,” “letters cut from hoarfrost”—that stays coherent throughout and matches the “foggy lucidity” premise. Diction and syntax are consistently tuned to this narrator’s perceptual bias, with metaphors that are surprising yet legible. Dialogue is slightly heightened but suits the mythic register and carries subtext rather than exposition. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though the lushness flirts with over-saturation in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyric, image-saturated, yet consistently tethered to the alchemist’s sensibility and lexicon. Repeated phrasings (“stoically sensitive,” “successive approximation,” “frozen bloom”) function as deliberate patterning rather than tics, and the narrative distance remains stable throughout. Brief dialogue from the bishop’s men is minimal but tonally apt and subtextually contrasts prayer-as-order with the alchemist’s silent stance. The voice modulates intensity effectively at the climax without slipping into explanatory scaffolding or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinctive, and consistent, merging technical jargon (“microwave horn,” “counterweights”) with lush metaphor in a way that feels character-specific. The perceptual signature—seeing the world as signals, endings, and structural poise—is strong, and the rhythm modulates well between incantatory and precise. There is no dialogue to test spoken idiom, but the interior narration carries scene, emotion, and idea without head-hopping or register glitches. At moments the density of figurative language risks feeling uniform, yet it remains controlled enough not to blur POV or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and textured, with a lyrical maritime idiom that feels plausibly rooted in the narrator’s work and worldview (“deckhands nod when storms are friends”). The handling of radio dialogue and the doubled self’s speech maintains clear focalization; the braided voices over the radio are especially well-controlled. Rhythmic variation and syntactic play support the sense of time-slippage without losing legibility. At times, the density of figurative language edges toward uniform elevation, slightly reducing modulation between quiet and peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, even when briefly noting other visitors, and the diction—“realistically imaginary,” “ordinary and heavy,” “fog that listens”—feels unified and intentional. Rhythm varies well between longer, baroque sentences and shorter, more declarative beats at key turns (“Then she asks, aloud and to herself…”). Lyricity is high but controlled; patterns like “not therapy, not theater, but…” show deliberate rhetorical shaping rather than drift. There is mild omniscient reach in glimpses of visitors’ histories, but it aligns with the gallery-as-sensing-organ conceit and does not confuse focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherently technical, mixing poetic metaphor with plausible professional lexicon (“pressure gap,” “geothermal stacks,” “methane vents”). Cadence and diction are consistent with a thoughtful, scientifically literate instructor who has lived underwater long enough to think in its terms. Shifts in rhythm—more incantatory when discussing edges and stars, more clipped around risk calculations—feel purposeful. The lack of dialogue means we don’t see conversational modulation, but the narrative voice itself is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries bureaucratic role (“contact tracer for hearts”) to numinous sensitivity. Diction (“sellers of exits that look like mercy but charge interest forever”) feels like this particular narrator’s idiom, not generic poeticism, and the internal texture stays steady under stress. Dialogue is sparse but strong, carrying subtext and shifts—Eli’s dry “are the dead always so bossy?” neatly lightens and seals their reconnection. There are a few aphoristic beats, yet they remain character-coherent and don’t blur POV or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, blending technical attentiveness with lyric metaphor in a way that feels like Ivo’s sensibility rather than generic omniscience. Diction is consistent (electroscopes and phase transitions sit comfortably next to “crashing hush”), and psychic distance stays tight. Patterned phrasing reinforces tone without lapsing into confusion. A couple of generalizing statements nudge toward authorial stance but are still plausibly Ivo’s internal language, so POV integrity largely holds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is lyrically consistent and character-specific, with a controlled rhythm of long, image-rich lines that still track cleanly. Diction like “map I can read,” “corridor in my lungs,” and “shadow stitched from clerks” feels cohesive to a reflective, scientifically adjacent mind under extreme duress. The ghost’s presence is filtered through this same voice, maintaining a stable psychic distance and avoiding head-hopping. There is occasional risk of the lyric register outpacing plausible in-the-moment thought, but the piece establishes an intentionally heightened, contemplative mode early enough that it reads as an earned aesthetic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and musical, with a strong perceptual signature (attention to texture, sound, and pattern). Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with this narrator’s sensibility, and the canyon’s one personified line (“I am quietly articulate…”) feels like a natural extension of that voice rather than a POV slip. Lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and held, without head-hopping or register shocks. Modulation under pressure is subtle but present as sentences tighten around the curse and sacrifice beats.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled blend of scientific and numinous diction (“cataloging lichens” beside “weather apologizing”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between observation, memory, and high-pressure ritual; the phone and cryptid’s translated speech feel tonally consistent yet otherworldly. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. The only restraint on an even higher score is that, at peak beats, the lyricism occasionally smooths over jagged affect that might further individuate the mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature—mechanical and organic images constantly interlace in ways that feel specific to this narrator. Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, with variations in sentence length that support both hush and swell. The limited, internally focused POV holds steady even as the world around her animates; there’s no leakage into omniscience beyond what the lyric mode implicitly licenses. Occasionally the voice edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains grounded enough in concrete perception to maintain character integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with a consistent way of perceiving (“cameras blinking like dragonflies afraid to land,” “a letter addressed to the space between two checkpoints”). POV is stable and modest—no unearned omniscience—and the diction matches a reflective, observant courier rather than an abstract essayist. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with long, image-rich lines balanced by tauter beats in moments of action (the bridge crossing, drone inspection). The controlled use of repetition and parallelism (“respectfully rebellious,” “by linking absences”) feels pattern-taught rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-close voice is distinctive and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to texture, sound, and small mechanical details. Lyric diction (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” “horses hung like stilled constellations”) is consistent and feels motivated by the character’s sensibility rather than bolted on. Psychic distance stays steady, and the narrative never over-claims knowledge beyond his experience. The modulation at key beats (oasis, crown’s response, first shiver of motion) is subtle but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly bookish-mathematical, with a controlled lexicon that fits a scientifically inclined poet-librarian. Diction and rhythm are patterned but varied enough to avoid monotony, and the psychic distance stays stable, with lyric abstraction always anchored to concrete library cues. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional philosophical line (“observed solitude means your heart is quiet but never unattended”) grows credibly from this consciousness. The only limiter keeping this just under 9 is that, at times, the rhetorical polish risks sounding a touch authorial rather than fully pressured in-the-moment.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses professional lexicon (catalogs, stamps, plates) and numinous imagery. Syntax and rhythm vary elegantly—short cadences like “I do not chase; I set the tripod…” punctuate denser metaphorical lines, maintaining legibility. POV boundaries hold; we never slip into knowledge the narrator couldn’t plausibly infer, and Aria’s presence is rendered in sensory metaphor rather than omniscient statement. The only ceiling comes from occasional lushness that risks ornamental excess, though it never quite obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    The omniscient, lyrical voice is remarkably consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (keys remembering silences, crickets as clerks, bells “learning a slower hour”). Syntax and rhythm flex to match pressure without becoming mannered, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shift. The diction is elevated but cohesive with the fable-like frame, and the narrative certainty matches a mythic, not literal, mode of knowing. This voice could credibly anchor a book-length work in the same register.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strong, consistent, and unmistakable: technical (“empirics of rumor”) yet myth-suffused, with a folklorist’s eye for pattern and language. Diction and imagery feel plausibly like this character’s lexicon and perception, and the narrative distance remains stable. Rhythm is well-controlled, with sentence lengths modulating to match pressure without falling into a mechanical cadence. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the lyric density occasionally skirts uniformity; a few more moments of syntactic starkness under peak pressure might sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is remarkably consistent, with a distinct, metaphor-rich perception that feels owned by this particular archivist. Diction and rhythm are controlled and adaptive, balancing lyrical narration with plainer, age-appropriate dialogue from the girl and a rougher, hoarse note from the brother. Patterned surreal logic (walls that argue back, dust as script) is taught early and sustains clarity through closure. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the voice’s texture itself enacts the “combative tenderness” the story thematizes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person lyrical voice is distinctive, with consistent diction (“radiant hush,” “branches speak in hues”) and a clear perceptual bias toward sensory and vegetal metaphors rooted in the pruner’s craft. POV is stable and confident; we are never confused about who is seeing or acting, even as the world grows more surreal. Rhythms vary enough to keep the lyricism from becoming singsong, and patterning (e.g., repeated “capturing essence”) feels intentional. There is a mild sameness of register—always elevated, never frayed—that slightly limits emotional modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature attuned to glass, tide, and silence. Diction like “interlaced hush,” “patient geometry,” and “a braid of quiet that drapes our shoulders” feels of a piece with the world and narrator rather than grafted-on ornament. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re inside a reflective but embodied craftsman, not an abstract essayist. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation from eerie quiet to tense ritual back to charged calm is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—metaphors of parchment, scars, throats, ears, and crescents arise from the narrator’s map-framer sensibility rather than from generic poetics. The perceptual bias is strong: they notice stains, edges, buckling, and “salt blooms,” and even people are filtered through archival or cartographic metaphors (the librarian who keeps archives “like recipes”). Psychic distance is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the tone modulates appropriately from professional calm to hushed reverence. Compression and elision are controlled and legible under a lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture—technical where needed, lyrical and metaphor-rich without losing clarity, and unmistakably this diver’s way of thinking. Diction like “ledger,” “vector resolved,” and “housebroken by current” feels character-consistent with a scientifically minded yet poetic narrator. POV is tight and stable, with Malik’s few lines of dialogue sounding natural and functional. A very slight sense of crafted aphorism in a few sentences is the only thing keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is consistent, idiosyncratic, and texturally rich, blending technical lexicon (“debug LEDs,” “maintenance threads”) with poetic coinages (“tinkersong wonder,” “parliament of whispers”) in a way that feels unified rather than stitched. Psychic distance stays steady; the narrator’s perceptions and inferred knowledge remain plausible for someone in their role and obsession. The rhythm varies effectively between long, incantatory lines and shorter, declarative pivots (“I am not loud because the city has enough alarms; I am seldom-heard because I sing for the gaps.”). There’s no head-hopping or register clash, even under peak moments when the ghost arrives and questions are exchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and texturally rich, with a clear perceptual signature—attuned to weather, light, and metaphor in ways that feel intrinsic to this narrator. Diction (“private weather of her moods,” “a leather notebook slipped… an encrypted diary discovery”) is elevated but coherent with the slightly formal, devoted-servant persona. The lyric compression and patterned metaphors are taught early and maintained, so the reader adjusts to the density without confusion. At times the prose edges toward ornate, but rhythm and control keep it from toppling into self-display.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is extraordinarily consistent: a meteorologist whose diction fuses technical terms with lyric sensibility (“pressure bloom,” “pale cylinder,” “half-life by the persistence of eddies”). Psychic distance stays tight, with no head-hopping or implausible omniscience; even cosmic observations are clearly filtered through her instruments and training. Rhythm and syntax modulate with intensity—litanies for cloud categories vs. longer, braided sentences in reflective beats—without losing clarity. The perceptual signature is unmistakable and would be hard to mistake for another narrator’s.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive—sensory, structurally rhythmic, and built around how this particular mind perceives space instead of faces. Diction (“air is a held chord,” “gray that lives in breath before thunder”) is elevated yet coherent with an artist steeped in craft and metaphor; it never drifts into an alien register. Psychic distance is steady, with lyrical compression that still tracks action and choice. There’s no dialogue, but the narrative voice alone carries texture and emotional movement.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and textured—whimsical yet precise, with recurring verbal habits (addressing objects, layered similes) that feel specific to this apprentice. Diction and imagery choices (e.g., “sound is a handshake when touch will not do,” “as if recess were a conspiracy”) both serve character and world, and the psychic distance stays stable. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even the more elaborate metaphors feel like extensions of this narrator’s sensibility. Under peak beats the rhythm tightens without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture—maritime and mechanical lexicon, patient syntactic sway—that feels inseparable from this character and world. Diction and imagery remain coherent, with patterned metaphors (harbors, tides, clocks, frost) rather than grab-bag ornament, and the psychic distance is steady. There is confident modulation from broader, atmospheric lines to tighter, action-linked sentences at the key moment of repair. It is lush but controlled, and the pattern is taught early enough that the lyricism never feels like an arbitrary overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person plural voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear communal sensibility that still allows for sharp individual moments (Ana, the narrator’s direct address to Vine). Diction and rhythm are carefully modulated, carrying a distinct lyrical cadence without drifting into abstraction. The narrative only knows what this “we” could plausibly infer; Vine’s mystery is preserved rather than over-explained. Under pressure, the voice tightens but never loses its perceptual signature, especially in the closing exchange with the chalked message.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature built from maritime, mechanical, and theatrical metaphors (“their applause returns as surf, their breath returns as wind”). Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the lyric compression never muddies basic orientation. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; the ritual sequence tightens into shorter clauses and concrete actions, then relaxes into longer, reflective lines post-closure. There is no head-hopping or explanatory overreach; the voice feels lived-in and idiosyncratic rather than generic “poetic prose.”

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, metaphor-rich, and consistent, balancing precision with a weary, wry fatalism (“as if discussing weather, because certainty calms panic more quickly than tenderness”). Diction and perception feel specific to someone long steeped in this strange, engineered ecology, not a generic lyric narrator. Psychic distance is skilfully managed: we stay inside the caretaker’s sensibility even when the prose grows abstract, and information never exceeds what this character plausibly knows. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the closing lines sharpen, rather than blur, the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistently colored by Mira’s chemist-musician sensibility, fusing molecular language with musical and riverine imagery in a distinctive way. Sentence rhythm modulates well between long, lyrical lines and shorter, action-focused beats when she builds and tests the bridge. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-rich, especially the brother’s line about both of them having “shed something and flew in crooked directions.” There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays steady and appropriate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, with an idiosyncratic yet controlled metaphor palette (“books grew here like glass fruit,” “inventorying the hush”). Diction and syntax maintain a coherent lyrical register that feels organic to this narrator and world. Rhythmic variation across lines and the patterned return of key phrases (“glimmering parole,” “clean slate,” “absence”) provide musicality without muddling sense. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory overreach; the voice trusts image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, lyrical diction that feels intrinsic to a chef whose primary sense is taste of memory; metaphors of weather, salt, and organs recur with intention. POV is stable and disciplined; we never leave the narrator’s experiential envelope, and the rare dialogue lines are simple, believable, and subordinate to the narrative texture. Rhythm modulates well between denser, figurative stretches and plainer functional beats (packing, walking, warning the boy). At times the lyricism approaches uniform high register, and a touch more variance at peak pressure could give certain moments sharper edges.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—mechanical parts are heard as lungs, organs, castanets, bells. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between incantatory lists and tighter, beat-driven lines (“No is a beat, she told the clock, and beats are doors”), and multilingual inserts feel organic to Mara’s worldview. There’s no head-hopping; even communal references remain filtered through her stance. A few metaphor-dense stretches risk uniform musicality, but they never blur POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a precise, quasi-technical lyricism that feels authentic to a “helix-minded engineer” rather than generic poeticism. Diction is consistent—phrases like “chaotically precise,” “coil chaos into circuits,” and “period of profound transformation” echo but do so in a patterned, intentional way. Psychic distance is well controlled: the piece sustains an intimate interior lens while maintaining enough altitude for thematic reflection. No head-hopping or stance slips undermine the coherence of the narrative mind.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“numbers rustling in the mist,” “curtain of cooled breath”). Diction and syntax feel plausibly aligned with a hyper-attentive, metaphor-minded archivist and maintain control even in peak beats. Patterned phrases (e.g., repeated key motifs) read intentional rather than mechanical, and there is no POV leakage or artificial exposition. Rhythm modulates well between dense description and more forward-driving lines, supporting the accumulative, meditative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a precise lexicon that plausibly belongs to a reflective artisan-scholar of sound and material. Rhythm and syntax vary; the long, sinuous sentences mirror contemplative attention without losing clarity. The perceptual signature—thinking in cracks, intervals, grammar, and bodily analogues—is strong enough that almost any line is instantly attributable to this narrator. Lyric density never slides into incoherence, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, marrying chess, magnetism, and civic repression into one coherent perceptual idiom (“the cold iron railing humming like a velvet throat”). Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, with long, metaphor-rich sentences that mostly maintain clarity and feel organic to a reflective, exiled tutor. Psychic distance stays stable; we never leave his sensibility, and the absence of dialogue suits a story about translating silence. Occasionally the density of figurative language edges toward uniform richness, leaving little modulation between quieter and peak moments, which slightly blunts dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently colored by “theatrical sincerity,” with a convincing mix of technical detail (coils, needle, frequencies) and lyrical metaphor. Psychic distance is steady, and the narration’s certainty matches what the character can infer; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, with many lines doing double duty for scene and theme (“the lamp likes applause,” “the whole room feels like a lung that learned patience from a stone”). Under increasing “pressure” from the impending fireworks, the voice intensifies without losing coherence or legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature keyed to scent and motion (“wildflower hush,” “tide’s thought,” “undercurrent of wisdom”). Syntax and rhythm are controlled; patterned phrasing feels intentional rather than mechanical, teaching the reader how to ride its cadences. The slightly elevated, metaphor-heavy diction is plausible as a close third focused on Mara’s sensibility and the story’s mythic register. A touch more modulation—brief plainer lines at peak stress—could sharpen contrast and give pressure beats extra punch.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically confident with a strong perceptual signature (“whirling silence,” “fruit lifts like bells,” “braided hush”), and it maintains coherence under stress. World-terms and metaphors feel native to this character’s life rather than pasted-on poetics, and psychic distance is steady. There is purposeful compression and figurative density, but it remains legible and never drifts into authorial explanation. No POV leakage or stance confusion undermines the core experience.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, precise, and lyrically technical, with a strong perceptual signature centered on airflow, surfaces, and procedure. Diction like “singular convergence,” “breathing grid,” and “pressure shadows” all feel plausible for this narrator and reinforce both occupation and worldview. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough for sensory immediacy while allowing reflective synthesis without head-hopping. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer accumulative sentences balancing clipped observational beats and a poised, memorable final line.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is assured, distinctive, and consistent, with a clear synesthetic perceptual signature (“the tone went rose, then rain”; “pinned inside my cloak was an amber music sheet, a fossil of song”). The lyric register feels organic to this character and world, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and diction modulate subtly with pressure, especially around the synchronized strike and the walking of the aurora’s colors. The only small limit is that the high lyricism is almost uniform, leaving little contrast in texture between quieter reflection and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature, full of crafted phrases like “wearing failure like a map I had misread” and “avalanchingly quiet” that feel both character-specific and world-appropriate. POV remains tightly controlled with no leakage; reflection is always anchored in present sensory cues and choices. Rhythm varies well, alternately incantatory and clipped, and the diction is consistently elevated without slipping into academic or corporate registers. The modulation under pressure is subtle rather than drastic, but the control is precise and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice (“we” shifting into an anchored “I”) is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: technically precise, metaphysically curious, and steeped in printshop detail. Diction like “press bed,” “forme,” “tympan,” and “derivative at that moment” feels natural for this narrator and sharpens both craft and conceptual stakes. Rhythms vary well—long braided sentences for reflection, tighter lines around the lever-drop and empathy-swap—without losing clarity. The operator’s presence is refracted through the narrator’s gaze but retains its own texture, and the small slips into almost-mathematical register feel character-driven rather than intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“ridge forgets its own angles,” “weight that folds maps around itself”). Syntax and rhythm modulate nicely, with long, sinuous sentences in reflective passages and tighter phrasing around the decisive act with the pendant. Diction is elevated but feels like this character’s natural idiom rather than authorial intrusion, and the pattern of image-making is taught early and sustained. No POV slippage or over-explaining undercuts the cumulative, slightly mythic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled lyrical density and a clear perceptual signature (scientific metaphors—riverbed silt, ballast, observatory—intertwined with devotional language). POV distance stays stable, and Mara’s dialogue has its own clipped, grounded cadence that contrasts with the narrator’s more figurative interiority. Rhythmic variation and syntax are carefully modulated to support hush and intensity without losing clarity. The voice sustains its texture under pressure, especially around the father-naming and apology beats, without slipping into generic register.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is a confident, consistent lyrical third-person with a strong perceptual signature (weaving, textiles, silence-as-thread metaphors) that matches the protagonist’s craft and world. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical without losing clarity, and the rare dialogue at the end feels natural and earned. The controlled use of patterned phrases (“stoically sparkling,” “raveling silence”) builds a coherent texture rather than generic ornament. It falls just short of the most distinctive, risk-heavy voices in elite venues, but the control is impressive.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: quietly formal, metaphor-rich, and focused on work, texture, and process in a way that matches the character’s craft. Diction and syntax are consistent and controlled, with recurring phrasal patterns (“between understanding and confusion,” “Azure defiance”) used as intentional motifs rather than tics. The lyric compression and occasional abstractions are anchored by concrete tools and actions, keeping the POV legible under pressure. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrative distance remains stable and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently synesthetic, with a clear perceptual signature (“taste like sea glass thawing on the tongue,” “silence aches with mass”). POV boundaries are clean and the narrative stance remains intimately tethered to the protagonist’s sensory logic; even worldbuilding passes through their idiosyncratic filters. Rhythm varies well between more compressed summary (“Every cycle, my leaps come unbidden…”) and slowed, image-rich beats at moments of attunement. The density and lushness approach the limit of what this length will bear, but legibility and emotional throughline remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistent, idiosyncratic, and emotionally precise, balancing maritime concreteness with lyrical metaphor (“the dusk was all pear and salt outside”). Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between observational detail and reflective abstraction without slipping out of what this skipper plausibly thinks. Diction and rhythm serve character and tone; lines like “I am reticent” feel earned rather than diagnostic. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the sparse dialogue is natural and subtext-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is exceptionally controlled: lyrical yet precise, seamlessly mixing technical language (“total internal reflection,” “cyclonic gyre”) with mythic metaphor. The perceptual signature—seeing storms as readers, headlines as laughter, ink as tide-lines—is distinctive and consistent throughout. Psychic distance is held confidently; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative does not cheat with knowledge the POV couldn’t plausibly frame. A slight risk is the uniformly elevated diction, but it feels organic to this character’s mind rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly controlled and distinctive, consistently filtering the world through bodily sensation and precise metaphor (“custody of breath,” “borrowed thunder”) in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. The dye master’s speech is notably different—laconic, precise, slightly gnomic—providing clear vocal contrast and status dynamics. Psychic distance is managed well: we stay close to the narrator’s perceptions without slipping into authorial exposition, and reflective moments are anchored in present stimuli (steam, light, the wing). The patterned lyricism is taught early and sustained, so it feels like a confident design rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent: “mundane miracles,” “clogged drain of stars,” and “a beaded curtain of patience” all feel like one mind’s idiolect. POV boundaries are clean and the lyric register remains believable for this narrator’s sensibility and occupation. Rhythm varies effectively between compressed image chains and calmer, expository lines, modulating with pressure (e.g., around the pin’s fall and rooftop scene). It stops just shy of transcendent by occasionally flirting with uniform lushness, but control and personality never lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (alchemical metaphors, plant and glass language), with no POV leakage. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled; sentences vary in length and cadence to support mood without slipping into opacity. Patterned diction (threads, glass, roots, breath) is purposeful and paid off at closure. The lyric compression feels confident and legible, supporting the accumulative structure rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a clear, lyrical signature—dense with metaphor but controlled, with cadences that match the tranquil, uncanny mood. POV is stable and focalized through Mara’s attention, while the slight mythic tilt in diction (“a hush older than the city”) still feels compatible with her interior world. Dialogue is spare but distinct, especially the silver-haired woman’s grounded, concept-laden lines that avoid expository clunk. The voice sustains itself without fraying under the story’s philosophical weight, though its uniform lyricism risks a slight sameness of intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (attention to small urban losses, textures, and ritualistic phrasing). Patterned diction like “uncloak,” “creeping normality noticer,” and “caretaker of thresholds” is taught early and carried through without wobble. When Maro and Keziah speak or act, their presence feels differentiated enough by what they bring (shears, bulbs, jokes, stories) even with minimal direct dialogue. The voice remains legible and controlled under emotional intensification, avoiding both exposition bloat and unmotivated shifts in register.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct: precise, sensory, slightly formal, and deeply shaped by the archivist’s profession and environment (“good shepherds of stray photons,” “hexagons of data around the honey of each vow”). POV distance is stable, with reflective lyricism anchored in concrete present actions and tools. Rhythm and diction modulate gracefully, allowing dense metaphor without losing syntactic clarity or slipping into mismatched registers. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the “quartz hush” cadence feels like a genuine perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: salted, tactile, and metaphorically inventive in a way that feels native to this character’s history and milieu. Diction and syntax are consistent, with recurring phrases like "curiously steadfast" functioning as intentional motif rather than tic. The silent-sign exchange and gestural focus maintain POV integrity while keeping dialogue subtextual and goal-driven. Rhythm modulates well between dense lyric description and tighter, pressured beats, supporting the accumulative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with a consistent sensory lexicon centered on taste and synesthetic weather-language. Diction like “nightstudy dust,” “storm debt,” and “emergent compass” feels character-bound and not generic-SF. Dialogue is sparse but natural within the fable-like frame and carries subtext (Naira naming the skeptic’s glow and “mouth”). Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the lyric compression never breaks POV modesty or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrical, coherent, and strongly patterned (“auroral sorrow,” “charcoal music,” “ledger of our earliest failures and joys”), with metaphors that feel native to this particular mind. POV is stable and the diction—technical where needed (“spindle,” “axle”) but sensuous overall—matches the character’s artistic, slightly mystical worldview. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between more compressed summary moments and slower, image-rich beats at the niche and final drawing. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strong, coherent, and unmistakably particular, balancing lyric density with a lived-in, craft-informed perspective. Metaphors grow organically from her world (“floorboards curled like tongues bitten too long,” “breath of old glue…like a reprimand”) and maintain a stable register. Psychic distance is well controlled: the narration slips between immediate perception and reflective confession without losing temporal or emotional anchoring. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the rhythmic modulation around the Ear scene and the final chamber feels deliberate and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a strong, recognizable texture (e.g., “rain on copper leaves,” “seasonally mute when the winds turned and stories curdled”). Diction stays aligned with the mythic, slightly elevated register of the world, avoiding jarring modern intrusions. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, lush sentences balanced by occasional clean declaratives that land structural beats. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears; the narrative distance feels controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person android voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphor and perception shaped by its role (“compasses stutter, needle teeth scratching”) and condition (“circuits carry a soft hiss like sand over glass”). POV control is steady; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and reflective passages are well-anchored to present stimuli. Rhythmic modulation tracks pressure—more expansive at setup, more clipped around the breach—without losing coherence. A few lines edge toward self-conscious poetics, but they remain within the established voice rather than feeling like external authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in fabric, stains, and thrift-store ephemera. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, giving the prose a musical but not overwrought cadence. The narrator’s way of framing others (“the mouth fills with our own weather while the ears catch seasons”) feels organically theirs, not generic-poetic. POV remains clean and stable, even as it holds the whole courtyard in a collective gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently colored by the narrator’s hybrid lexicon of music, machinery, and sea (“valves taught to hum,” “doors that open on rhythm”). The patterned repetitions (“as a spider spins its web,” “encrypt vulnerability as strength”) read as deliberate structural motifs rather than tics. Psychic distance and temporal stance are stable; the lyric compression never slips into confusing omniscience or unmotivated register shifts. The only minor limitation is that the voice is almost uniformly elevated, even under peak stress, which slightly narrows emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Ilya’s perceptions—nautical and mechanical particulars mingle with almost mystical attentiveness (grounds, gravity, salt) in a distinctive way. Syntax and rhythm are varied and under control, with patterned repetitions (“gleaming silence,” leaning flames, pockets of gravity) that feel intentional and structural rather than tics. Brief quoted lines from the remembered woman are differentiated in tone and do meaningful work without breaking perspective. The voice sustains its register under pressure without drifting into abstract jargon or authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive—lyric, image-dense, and calm—with a clear perceptual signature centered on gaps, intervals, and quiet. Diction is elevated yet consistent with a mage-like contemplative consciousness, and the syntax varies enough to sustain musicality. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated shifts; all knowing feels plausibly tied to his heightened attunement. The risk is that the uniform high-register lyricism may slightly blur sharper shifts in pressure, but control is strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature—seeing meteors as commas, basil as an encyclopedia, a smile as “a single very considerate minute.” Diction and rhythm are consistent with a reflective, slightly bookish narrator, and the tutor’s speech has its own calm, compressed idiom. POV remains stable, with no cheating of knowledge, and the metaphoric density feels intentional rather than ornamental. A few lines flirt with over-elaboration, but they don’t undercut clarity or the emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and deeply character-specific; the diction (“tidebone,” “fragrant shrapnel,” “twilight instruments”) feels like this mind and no other. Lyric compression and patterning are taught from the first line and never break POV plausibility. Rhythm modulates well, slowing for reflection and tightening around the niche decision and opening moment. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the perceptual signature (skeptical, tender, procedural) remains sharp under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature: this is someone who thinks in grammar, hinges, and linework, and the diction reflects that. Lyric compression and elevated vocabulary are consistent with the character’s craft and milieu, and psychic distance is handled smoothly—intimate without drifting into explanatory. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the few spoken lines feel continuous with the narrative voice. The only reason not to go higher is that the uniform lushness of the register leaves little modulation in rhythm or texture at peak ethical beats where a sharper tonal shift might deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a consistent acoustic perceptual signature (hearing grief, tones of fear, the universe’s hum) and controlled lyricism. Diction and metaphor remain coherent with the narrator’s sensibility; even heightened phrases like “map folded inside a breath” feel voice-motivated rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance and tense are steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. If anything, a few philosophical sentences could be slightly pared to keep the voice from edging into manifesto, but they do not break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and sustained, with patterned but controlled lyricism (“I am a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, and I was called here”). Diction and metaphor remain consistent with the narrator’s sensibility, and psychic distance stays stable even as the piece moves through reflection and present action. There is no head-hopping; the girl’s presence is rendered through the narrator’s perceptions and embodied sensations (“a bruise under my tongue”). The only limit on an even higher score is that the lyric register is very high throughout, with minimal modulation, which slightly narrows expressive range.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and character-inflected, with a strong perceptual signature (water metaphors, close attention to texture and sound). Dialogue is slightly elevated but natural for a fable-like frame, and characters’ speech rhythms are distinct enough (Li’s bluntness, the philosopher’s riddling, Yazhen’s spare honesty). POV is stable and never confusing despite its poetic compression. Rhythmic control is excellent, with sentence length and cadence modulating appropriately at moments of discovery and teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending a reporter’s precision with a slightly lyrical, cynical edge (“people traded stories to make the miracle easy to sleep beside”). The perceptual signature—attuned to scams, corporate euphemism, and the physics of dust—is distinct and character-specific. Klay’s simpler, more faith-inflected speech contrasts well with the narrator’s analytic diction, giving dialogue subtext without overstatement. Tense, stance, and psychic distance are steady, with no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinctive, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“whale skull” portico, “kite of spoons,” “smile like a cracked moon”). Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained, yet key causal beats remain legible—which is difficult at this density. POV distance is stable: we never slip into others’ interiority, yet we sense their roles through the narrator’s metaphoric lens. Under peak stress, the voice maintains its texture without collapsing into either flat reportage or overwrought haze, which is close to publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strikingly consistent and alive, with a strong perceptual signature built around sound, barter, and coastal imagery. Syntax and rhythm vary with mood—the storm sequences tighten, reflective beats lengthen—yet remain controlled and legible. Diction (“feral loft,” “sweeten the silent bread of days,” “crooked essay”) stays within a believable poetic lexicon for this narrator and never drifts into generic workshopese. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from solitude to shared kinship reads clean and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and specific—phrases like “a brass heartbeat asking me to be worthy” and “listening to the skin of the bay” feel like this character’s mind, not generic poetics. POV is stable and controlled; we never slip out of her knowledge while still inferring the Collector’s inner state through behavior. Dialogue is stylized yet coherent for this heightened world, carrying subtext about commerce versus sacred duty. Rhythm modulates well between image-rich description and leaner, pressure-bearing lines during the Lens activation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“feet placed like commas, breath written in the margins”). Diction and rhythm support the restrained-wild tone, modulating gracefully between concrete observation and elevated metaphor without losing clarity. Brief dialogue is spare and functional, carrying status and attitude with minimal lines. The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or register drift, and the voice feels fully owned by this particular observer.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, marrying technical observation (“service tag dated last week”) with metaphorical perception (“rusted echo like a coin spinning in a dry cup”). Psychic distance and rhythm tighten appropriately at pressure points without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage; even higher-register phrases feel motivated by this character’s reflective, somewhat poetic mind. The patterned diction around light, tunnels, and sound is controlled rather than mannered, giving the piece a memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is steady, lucid, and quietly lyrical, with a distinct perceptual bias toward ritual, weather, and crafted objects. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths supporting the meditative tone without slipping into vagueness. Mara’s speech is simple and grounded, contrasting the chaplain’s more figurative narration just enough to feel like a different person. There’s no POV leakage or gratuitous exposition; elisions are purposeful and the stance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistently distinctive—playful, barbed, and metaphor-drunk in a way that feels tied to Sera’s mind rather than generic lyricism. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, turning punchy around key beats (“The past is so considerate sometimes it leaves a tooth behind”) and stretching when she reflects. There is no head-hopping; interior access is stable and confident. The only minor reservation is occasional near-uniform intensity of figurative texture, which slightly flattens modulation but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is singular and controlled, fusing lyrical metaphors (“banked cinders of public grief”) with plausible tech/corporate diction (“memorial escalation,” “candlelight permissions”). Perceptual bias is consistent: she notices patterns, absences, and infrastructure in ways that feel specific to a memory keeper. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with denser, incantatory lines in the archive contrasted with the lighter, almost wry bus moment. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; the prose texture itself feels like an extension of her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistently colored by the narrator’s work and temperament—lyrical but anchored in tools, weather, and tasks. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between more compressed, image-rich reflection (the mirrors) and cooler, procedural calm (route-marking, lantern-light). POV boundaries are clean; we infer envoys’ reactions through behavior and shared images rather than head-hopping. The diction feels plausibly “this narrator” throughout, with no jarring register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature in its synesthetic attention to sound and texture. Lyric density is high but patterned from the opening line, and the register remains plausibly that of a highly literate, self-aware narrator. Brief dialogue with Mikko is economical and character-specific, advancing stakes (“Endings announce themselves like weather”) rather than expositing. Psychic distance stays steady, and the modulation into the closing resolve feels like a tonal deepening rather than a shift into explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and saturated with viticultural metaphor in a way that feels character-true rather than generic. Diction and rhythm are varied, with sentence-length modulating nicely between compressed lyricism and clearer exposition when needed. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (e.g., “laughs without laughter”) and plot (the bus question, the hoarded silence, the call). A few lines veer toward essayistic register (“To nurture intersubjective understanding is the only crop I dare claim”), but they are integrated enough with the narrator’s self-conception not to break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistent, sensuous, and clearly filtered through someone trained to notice structures of sound and tension; Lio’s speech has its own idiom—plain, precise, and slightly proverbial. The lyric register is stable and purposeful, with metaphors that feel native to this mind and world (“sky of patient dust,” “echo would bruise itself”). Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying close enough for texture but not collapsing into expository gloss. Experimentation (accumulative, image-driven narration) is taught early and sustained without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: it blends precise sensory observation with metaphor in a way that feels particular to a “subtle puzzle archivist.” Diction choices (“patient time signature of collective healing,” “clothespins…pinned themselves to light”) are elevated but coherent with a narrator steeped in ritual and art, and psychic distance is steady. Magical realist touches are narrated with the same calm, matter-of-fact tone, reinforcing the world’s texture rather than breaking it. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the narrative rhythm modulates well between quiet description and more charged moments.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—metaphors are consistent with the scholar’s contemplative, acoustic attention (“soft as chalk dust,” “meadow of replies”). Diction and rhythm shift tactfully between more abstract reflection and concrete action without losing coherence. There is no dialogue to test, but the handling of the custodians’ presence and the court scene maintains clear focalization through the scholar. The perceptual signature—sound-obsessed, gently metaphysical—is memorable and steady under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and deeply fused with the prophet’s perceptual signature—junkyard and tidal, mechanical and oceanic. Rhythm and diction are carefully modulated; the prose feels like a single, coherent mind noticing the world in metaphor rather than an abstract narrator pontificating. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shift, and the rare line of direct speech or interior address sits naturally within the lyric narration. Patterned elision and compression (e.g., future voices on tape) are taught early and pay off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and deeply tied to the narrator’s technical and emotional obsessions, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Diction blends poetic metaphor with plausible domain knowledge (“governor,” “escape velocity,” “thermal tides”) in a way that feels character-driven, not imposed. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative lines and tighter, action-oriented sentences around the repair and quake. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the accumulated metaphors feel like a coherent idiom rather than style pasted on.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, disciplined lyricism that feels organic to a careful, observant music therapist. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, especially around the call to Lena and the practice of the final chord, without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparing but carries subtext and purpose (Lena’s single line to her sister is perfectly pitched). POV distance and knowledge remain stable; there’s no leakage into omniscience or explanatory intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—lyric yet precise, with images like “teeth sharp as bitten frost” and “gears ratcheting like rain” giving a strong perceptual signature. The narrative distance stays stable, comfortably close to the apprentice’s sensibility without omniscient leakage, and the Archivist’s speech is differentiated yet tonally harmonious with the world. Patterned diction around loops, spirals, and noon is clearly intentional and supports both atmosphere and theme rather than reading as artifact. Under pressure (the revelation scene), the rhythm tightens without losing clarity or slipping registers.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and fully character-bound, blending clinical knowledge with folk imagery in a way that feels singular (“bones ask to be believed before they consent to mend”). Diction and syntax are consistently controlled, with rhythm that suits the quiet but charged mode. Mara and the boy have discernible presence and idiom even with minimal quoted dialogue, and there is no head-hopping or stance drift. The patterned metaphoric language is taught early and sustained without becoming obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses astronomical, tidal, and bodily metaphors in a consistent register. Psychic distance is steady; even when summarizing past events, the narration remains sensorial and grounded in present vocation. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the cadences modulate subtly with key beats (a slight heightening around the pearl’s appearance, a calming at closure). The diction is elevated but feels native to this particular consciousness rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and texturally rich, with a perceptual signature that fuses technical and organic lexicons (“data lanes we once threaded,” “sewing moss with fishing line”). Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately, maintaining lyric intensity without becoming opaque. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, matching the “protected vulnerability” tone. The only minor check is that the high lyric register is very even across the entire piece, leaving little modulation between emotional peaks and quieter beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, unified, and lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (rivers as sentences, books as standing stones, hopes as boats/knots/light). First-person distance stays consistent, and the syntax modulates well—long, sinuous lines for meditation, tighter ones at turns (“So I turned against the current of forgetting”). Dialogue is sparse but character-distinct and purposeful, carrying subtext (the girl’s rebuke, the mentor’s compact advice). There is no head-hopping or register drift; the surreal lexicon fits both narrator and world.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and cohesive, with a distinct texture in its metaphors and cadence (“breath braided into quiet,” “water lifted in the hidden rills”). POV holds to a close, mythic-omniscient stance that feels intentional, occasionally inhabiting collective village perception without confusion. Rhythm modulates well—long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere punctuated by shorter, decisive beats at structural turns (“The arbor answered with a single shiver…”). The only small limitation is that the voice is so uniformly elevated that moments of sharper contrast or roughness under pressure are rare.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is tightly controlled, with a consistent, poetic diction that feels like an extension of the alchemist’s perception (ritualistic, patient, attentive to texture and light). Rhythms vary and are well tuned to the contemplative, accumulative mode; the syntax never loses control even when it leans lush. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; distance remains steady and apt. A hair more modulation—brief sharper, plainer beats under peak pressure—could sharpen contrast without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and textured, with a perceptual signature rooted in profession and temperament (“I am peripherally focused by habit”). Diction and metaphor field are coherent (keys, doors, echoes, stone, breath, time), and the lyric compression never loses track of the focalizer’s stance. Psychic distance is well controlled for a reflective piece, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift. This is a confident, publishable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in vocation (“thread hearing into shapes you can weigh”). Lyric density and neologisms feel motivated by the character’s way of thinking, not by generic ornamentation, and the cadence shifts appropriately around key turns (lamp orientation, valley’s question). There’s no head-hopping, and the slight mythic distance fits the material. A few phrases repeat (“boundary-lessly trapped”) but read as intentional leitmotif rather than accident.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by her history with circus work and craft. Diction choices like “hauntingly practical,” “quieted roar,” and “a thin animal nosing the air” feel both character-appropriate and thematically integral. Rhythm varies well, using mostly long, flowing sentences with occasional shorter anchors to land emotional beats. There is no POV slippage or register drift; the narrative stance feels confident and singular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“silence has weight, and the floating lilies shiver with leftover motion, like a song stripped to bones”). POV distance and access are stable, and the slight temporal slippage in diction is thematically motivated rather than confusing. Dialogue is sparse but carries clear subtext and pressure, especially in the ghost’s refusal and Mara’s story-based counterarguments. At moments the density of figurative language edges toward lushness, which is mostly an asset but occasionally risks softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and consistent: a blend of technical vocabulary and quiet lyricism that matches a “functionally creative” engineer. Sentence rhythm is well modulated, with accumulative images that build atmosphere without losing clarity. The perceptual signature is strong—she notices load paths, valves, gradients, and social routes—anchoring POV plausibly. Occasional abstract formulations graze the edge of authorial rather than strictly character-bound language, but they remain largely in tune with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is singular, lyrical, and controlled, with consistent metaphorical logic tied to clocks, ice, rain, and breath. Psychic distance stays steady: we inhabit her perceptions and conceptual language without head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, lush sentences balanced by shorter, clarifying ones at key turns (“I did not ring the bell; I bore it…”). The register is elevated but plausible for this reflective, ritual-bound narrator, though once or twice the density tips toward self-consciousness rather than effortless interior speech.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with metaphors that feel consistent with this character’s mind (“heron landing,” “rope sliding over wood”) and never losing track of scene reality. Dialogue is sparse but sharp and character-specific, advancing stakes and subtext (the foreman’s terse deflection, the watchman’s weary wit). The narrative distance is well-controlled, allowing reflective lines without breaking the immediacy of the unfolding investigation. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the high lyricism remains at one sustained register, with limited modulation into rawer or more fragmented rhythms under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual bias toward weather, texture, and humble tools that suits a “philosophical seed collector.” The fisherman’s simpler, more practical speech differentiates him cleanly while still carrying subtext and emotional memory. Syntax and rhythm are controlled and varied, with long sinuous sentences used for contemplative beats and shorter lines for key turns (“I have no time, he says…”). There are no POV slips or register mismatches; the metaphoric density feels like an attribute of this particular mind rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (objects imbued with memory: “bread remembers the heat that birthed it”). Lyric compression and patterned metaphor are taught from the first line and sustained without head-hopping or register slips; the fantastical device (“projecting presence”) is narrated with the same calm, tactile precision as the mundane. Modulation is subtle but present—moments like the letter’s arrival tighten rhythm and phrasing. Overall the voice feels singular and confident enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently colored by mechanical and religious imagery—“gears and prayers,” “song of oil,” “parade of brass pretending to be the god of light.” The rhythm of the sentences supports the dreamlike, reverent-yet-wary stance, and the diction remains plausibly tied to this character and world. Patterned elision and lyric compression are taught early and sustained; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the density of figurative language risks overshadowing moment-to-moment emotional modulation, keeping this just under exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and lyrically controlled, with metaphors that feel organic to this narrator’s vocation and history. Psychic distance is stable; we never leave her lens, and the boy’s few lines of dialogue feel age-appropriate and understated. The rhythmic modulation across sentences supports the contemplative pressure without sliding into monotone. A few highly figurative sentences risk feeling slightly overworked, but they don’t break legibility or voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—phrases like “sidereal patience” and “bread of glass” feel organic to this mind. Diction and metaphor choices are consistent and character-specific, balancing abstraction with tactile detail. The narrative distance stays steady, with reflective statements anchored in immediate sensory or situational cues, avoiding expository over-explaining. There’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts, and the modulation from cool skepticism to more tender vulnerability at the end is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, coherent texture: precise, metaphor-rich, and shaped by someone who reads the universe in patterns of light, pollen, and grief. Diction choices like “hush-spindle,” “moth-whales,” and “calculating machine gear” feel native to this mind, not decorative. POV distance stays stable; we never slide into the stranger’s interiority, only observe her through the caretaker’s interpretive lens. The lyric ornateness is sustained without fracture, though a few phrases could be pruned without harming voice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft and ritual. Syntax and diction suit a “fiercely meditative” artisan: long, thoughtful sentences, precise verbs, and metaphor that reflects her sensibility.

At times the cadence risks uniformity, but overall rhythm modulates enough to carry emotional shifts and never undermines clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and clearly tied to this specific consciousness: a technically competent, guilt-haunted winder who thinks in mechanical, tidal, and bodily metaphors. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied, with lines like “Time becomes a skin I can lift, a hollowness I can breathe” showcasing a stable lyric mode rather than drift. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the reflective reach fits someone in a ritualized, practiced solitude. Under stress at the core decision, the voice stays coherent and intensifies rather than flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is tightly aligned with Rowan’s sensibility and maintains a distinct, lyrical texture—“pruning moss like errant thoughts,” “a harbor waiting for maps”—without losing clarity. Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, sustaining a steady psychic distance that feels intimate but not confessional. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the small amount of lineated quasi-omniscient insight (e.g., “they said”) is clearly filtered through the narrative frame. The modulation from wonder to quiet release at the end is especially deft.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and distinctive, with an intellectual yet sensuous lexicon (“orerries and wooden abaci…gardens, their cogs sprouting petals of possibility”). POV distance is stable and appropriate for a reflective, concept-driven scene; we stay inside the narrator’s perception without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between long, image-rich sentences and sharper declarative lines at key turns (e.g., the trellis vs. wall explanation). The voice is elevated but feels grounded in the character’s role and world, not like generic poetic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, musical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its blend of musical and meteorological metaphors (“sea-green arithmetic,” “alphabet of weather”). The lyric density is high but pattern-taught from the first sentence, and the syntax flexes nicely between long, coiling phrases and firmer declaratives at key turns. POV remains cleanly with Mara’s frame of knowledge, even as it adopts an almost-mythic narrative distance. One could argue the diction is slightly elevated beyond what Mara herself might articulate, but the quasi-fable stance feels intentional rather than a leak.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its art-and-ritual metaphors. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between incantatory description and more grounded exchanges with Soren, and the limited dialogue carries subtext rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent—lyric but grounded, with an abrasive, sardonic intelligence that feels fully inhabited. POV remains stable and modest in its claims, with no head-hopping or implausible omniscience. Diction and metaphor texture (“argue with superstition and bureaucracy in equal, measured breaths”; “arguments sharpened on silence”) match the character’s education and bitterness without drifting into generic essay-voice. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense lyric sentences and cleaner declaratives, supporting emotional and thematic turns.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (tasting emotions and memories, culinary metaphors for listening and rebellion). Diction and rhythm are controlled; long, sinuous sentences are balanced with sharper beats at key moments, and Kye’s simpler, questioning dialogue contrasts effectively with the narrator’s richer idiom. The brief foray into quasi-scientific explanation (“synaptic plasticity”) mostly fits the narrator’s craft-consciousness but momentarily brushes against a more essayistic register. Overall, the POV is stable and expressive, easily publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, metaphor-rich, and tightly controlled, with a consistent lexicon (“nectar dusk,” “a dry fountain,” “clocks that still tick in burned houses”) that feels like this particular mind. Mara’s speech and reactions carry a more grounded, engineerly tone, creating a clean contrast without breaking the overall lyrical register. POV boundaries are stable; we never slip into unsupported omniscience. Rhythmic variation and image patterning (lightning as music, wonder as toll) heighten emotional beats rather than obscuring them.

    The first-person voice is highly distinctive—lyric yet controlled, with motifs (“hush,” “blaze,” “listening”) woven into a coherent perceptual signature. Diction and metaphor choices feel native to this narrator and remain stable without notable register slips, even in more abstract reflections.

Rhythm and diction are controlled; repetition of key phrases (“incisively kind,” “structural weakness,” “threading”) feels patterned, not accidental. POV stays stable in access and distance, even as it moves through memories and other objects’ voices, preserving the lyric-collective feel without head-hopping confusion. The modulation from eerie to gently hopeful at the end is smooth and grounded in the same verbal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—intellectual, wry, and haunted—braiding mathematical diction with sensuous, almost mystical imagery in a consistent register. Phrases like “each landing is a hypothesis and each riser a lemma” and “a topology of vows and remainders” feel both character-specific and thematically apt. Psychic distance is well-controlled; even the abstractions feel immediate because they’re clearly this mind’s way of seeing.

A touch more variation in cadence around key emotional beats could heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is strikingly consistent and character-specific: erudite, sensory, and metaphor-rich in a way that fits a “cultured museum guide” under pressure. The diction and rhythms (“the way a lighthouse talks to the dark,” “green stitches, tightening my borrowed courage”) create a memorable perceptual signature without drifting out of the established register. Psychic distance is well-controlled; even when the prose becomes more reflective near the end, it remains anchored in physical action (drying costumes, cataloging labels). Density is high but patterned from the outset, so the lyricism reads intentional, not accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, metaphor-rich lyricism that matches the character’s precision and oddity as a counter-clockwise clockmaker.

The sister’s few lines feel appropriately strange and reversed while still legible, reinforcing tone and theme. Patterned phrasing supports rather than obscures meaning, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is gorgeously lyrical yet coherent, with a distinct lexicon blending maritime, musical, and quasi-mystical diction (“fractal generating,” “dub the sea,” “a corridor for the wave to pass”). Third-person focus is tight on the prophet’s perceptions, and the patterned imagery of sound and weather teaches its own logic early and never wavers. Rhythm and sentence shape modulate well, with longer, incantatory lines for pattern-building and slightly clipped beats at tactical moments (“He began, a metronome of ankles and wrists…”).

The patterned diction around shells, patterns, and breath is consistent without becoming obscure, and focalization stays tight to her perceptions and inferences. Rhythm modulates well between long, sinuous sentences for contemplation and shorter lines at key actions (“I keep blowing."). At the highest bar, a bit more syntactic variation in the midsection could keep the lyricism from bordering on uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and recognizably its own, with patterned phrases (“fictional historian,” “by drawing parallels”) that feel like deliberate stylistic motifs rather than tics. POV is steady around Mara with light omniscient touches that suit the quasi-legendary tone and don’t cause confusion. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and character-distinct: Tomas’s “You will blister the town” and “laughs once, like a loose screw” contrasts well with Mara’s measured, almost procedural responses. The lyricism stays controlled enough that voice supports rather than overwhelms the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)

Psychic distance stays steady, with enough immediacy to keep us close while allowing reflective compression. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—the crane-folding sequence tightens, the final release breathes—without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, blending scientific lexicon with lyrical, trauma-soaked imagery in a way that feels character-specific. POV boundaries are clean; we never slip inside Liyun’s head, and all inference stays plausible for the narrator. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense metaphoric stretches and plainer procedural lines (“We release a seed of noise into the field and watch the spectral map bud and flower”).

The diction maintains a steady register that feels plausible for a reflective, self-lacerating professional criminal; psychic distance is stable and purposeful. Patterned phrasing such as “sieved hush” and “market I helped build” reads as motif rather than formula. At times the lyricism is uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens modulation under peak stress, but clarity is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel like the negotiator’s own cognition rather than generic ornament. POV control is tight; we never slip outside what this narrator can perceive or infer. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with clear status dynamics and moral subtext in Neris’s and Bram’s apologies.

Rhythm and diction are controlled across the piece, modulating intensity without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person lyric voice is distinctive, consistent, and tightly bound to the narrator’s sensibility—spice, animal, and cosmic imagery all feel like her way of thinking. Diction (“paradoxically steady hush,” “saffron laughter”) is elevated but coherent for this character and modulates slightly at emotional peaks without losing control. Brief dialogue from fox and the beloved is clean, sparse, and carries subtext more than exposition. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift; the patterned, incantatory rhythm is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm and a clear perceptual signature (time-obsessed, ritual-minded, metaphorically dense). Diction and syntax remain consistent with a lyrical, slightly heightened interior monologue, and the magical elements are fully naturalized within that stance.

There is no head-hopping or register drift; abstractions (“Earned Stasis”–type moments) are always grounded quickly in felt images like boots “barely kissed metal.” The rhythmic variation and repetition (“stitched,” “quilted,” “suture”) feel intentional rather than mechanical, supporting the emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, blending Mara’s sensibility with a lightly elevated narrative stance in a coherent way. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with inventive but legible metaphors (“ashfall stitched silver commas,” “the mountain’s low organ”) that reinforce atmosphere and theme. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance is modulated smoothly between sensory immediacy and wider cosmic frames. At times the lyricism is so uniformly heightened that it risks slightly smoothing over sharp emotional spikes, but the voice remains assured and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a lovely blend of mechanical attentiveness and poetic metaphor (“my keys clinked like cool birds nesting,” “metal stuttered”). Diction fits a thoughtful, slightly mystical sentinel and never drifts into jarring register shifts or explanatory exposition. Rhythm is varied and confident; the lyric compression doesn’t obscure action or stakes, and the narrative stance stays tightly bound to the sentinel’s perceptions. Occasional high-density metaphor clusters flirt with over-richness but remain legible and pattern-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphor and syntax reflecting a mind tuned to patterns and prophecy (“ride the slope as if steering a thought”). POV is stable and intimate, with no leakage; even high-concept lines stay grounded in the narrator’s perception rather than authorial gloss. Rhythm varies well, balancing incantatory sentences with sharper beats around key actions, and the diction suits both the character’s strangeness and the world’s altered physics. It’s a memorably singular voice, just shy of the very top band due to occasional density that slightly smooths local emotional spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctively lyrical with a strong perceptual signature—favoring storm, scar, and photographic imagery—and maintains consistent psychic distance. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with patterned metaphors that feel intentional rather than random ornament. Mara’s dialogue is slightly stylized, aligning with the overall poetic register, but still reads as spoken and goal-driven, revealing her as a “curator of broken things.” There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; elision and compression are purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, metaphor-rich, and consistently philosophical without losing track of concrete action. The courier’s dialogue has its own clipped, soldierly flavor, which helps maintain character distinction even within elevated language. POV is stable and trustworthy; elisions are stylistic rather than evasive. At times the highly wrought diction risks a uniform register between narration and speech, but rhythm and idiom mostly stay under tight control.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and tightly tied to perception: metaphors like “shipwreck of pages and iron” and “the gate is sky, and the sky is a listening room” are character-specific rather than generic lyricism. POV control is steady; there’s no head-hopping and no unjustified omniscience, and the modulation from memory to present action feels seamless. Mara’s presence is seen through the narrator’s bias, but her idiom and silence (“remembers her cell, and does not speak”) still read as a separate, legible character. Elision and repetition (“It was a friendship sparked…”) are patterned and purposeful, not artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, metaphorically inventive, and consistently filtered through the pianist’s sensibility and profession. Imagery (“leader curled like a sleeping centipede,” “gulls swam through the vapor as if it were water woven thin”) feels character-driven rather than generic. POV is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or explanatory intrusion; even the few lines of dialogue retain the same textured register. The rhythmic modulation from contemplative to more urgent as the corridor opens is controlled and supports the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, blending quasi-technical language (“audit,” “assigned,” “instruments”) with mythic-poetic diction (“library walking,” “luminous doubt”). Point of view is stable and well-controlled; we never leave the narrator’s sensibility, and the collective moments (“we form a net of remembrance”) read as deliberate ritual, not POV leakage. Rhythm and syntax support the lyric, accumulative mode without becoming opaque, modulating slightly as pressure rises near the monsoon. It is highly polished and character-specific, if occasionally bordering on a single unmodulated register of elevated lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct: gently formal, patient, filled with arboreal and maritime metaphors that feel organic to a bonsai tutor on a listening island. Syntax and rhythm are well controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching the meditative pace and no head-hopping or stance confusion. The diction is elevated but consistent with the established poetic consciousness (“as if nostalgia had gravity,” “as if a lighthouse had been buried in it by grief”). Under peak beats the voice tightens without breaking register, giving the closure image clarity and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative voice is exceptional—precise, slightly detached yet deeply observant, fitting the "sentient robot" archetype without falling into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "fable" quality throughout. However, the narrator exhibits unearned certainty about Rell's internal motives ("He wanted to spare the public"), which blurs the POV boundaries.

The transition from internal reflection to dialogue with the Auditor is smooth and maintains the established tonal distance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on a specific syntactic structure (simile/metaphor pairings) that creates a distancing effect. The dialogue between Hale and Sera feels slightly stiff and uniform, with both characters speaking in similar rhythmic patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    The noir-adjacent tone is consistent, but the voice occasionally lapses into overwrought metaphor ("swallowed by it like a prayer gulped at daylight") that distances the reader. The "drowsy alertness" is well-maintained, but the register sometimes drifts into poetic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, authoritative, and deeply atmospheric, fitting the persona of a chronicle keeper perfectly. The lyrical register is sustained without breaking, though the high-poetic tone creates a slight distance that prevents full emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric, but the mandated phrase "sensitively perceptive" is inserted clumsily twice, disrupting the rhythm ("sensitively perceptive and odd"). The narrative distance is otherwise well-controlled and appropriate for the fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout. However, it relies heavily on simile ("swung like a metronome," "rose like staff lines") which occasionally distances the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical intensity that suits the fable-like quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is highly distinct, maintaining a consistent poetic texture that reflects the protagonist's "filtered" reality. The transition from solitary observation to the shared "we" at the ending is earned. At times, the stylization risks distancing the reader, but the perceptual signature is strong and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and highly textured, fitting the atmospheric nature of the piece. The "myth buster" perspective filters the magical realism through a lens of empirical testing ("testing whether stories could bear ordinary hands"), which maintains a unique stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, though it occasionally suffocates the narrative with dense metaphorical layering ("routes were confetti," "trust was stitched... like sequins"). The highly stylized tone creates a distance that muffles the urgency of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, meditative, and observant, fitting the "inspector" persona. It occasionally slips into over-poeticism that draws attention to the author rather than the character ("mouse of sound," "swallowing the Milky Way like bread").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, polished, and maintains a consistent lyrical texture that suits the fabulist mode. However, the voice overwrites the claimed "dry wit," delivering poetic metaphors ("punctuation mark," "fern memory") where the prompt suggested a sharper, drier tone. Control of distance is excellent, keeping the reader close to the narrator’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.0)
    The lyrical, archaic voice is consistent and appropriate for a fable. However, it creates a distancing effect, and the shift to the collective "we" feels assumed rather than earned by the scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is generally distinct and lyrical, but suffers from significant register breaks caused by forced prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the "futuristic nostalgia" of the piece. The "pseudonym creator" persona is established through a distinct lexicon ("night lake," "circulatory system").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is distinct, whimsical, and immersive, successfully sustaining the "magic artist" persona. However, the consistent high-whimsy register ("purse of spare dawns") risks distancing the reader from genuine emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, perfectly suiting the "mural restorer" persona. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature ("fountains sketch ripples"), though it occasionally risks over-polishing the internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently tuned to the surreal premise. However, the rhythm is occasionally flattened by a reliance on repetitive simile structures ("like [noun]"), which makes the narration feel slightly more constructed than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric register, though it occasionally veers into overwrought territory. The repetition of the specific prompt phrase "shyly unstoppable" three times within a short space breaks the narrative immersion and feels like a visible artifact.

The narration feels authoritative without slipping into excessive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and meditative, suited to the atmospheric lens. At times, the "poetic" register feels slightly constructed ("soft airport of the desk"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct and controlled throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-lyric mode but lacks range; dialogue is indistinguishable from narration, creating a monochromatic effect. The relentless metaphorical density creates a distance that prevents the reader from grounding in the scene's immediate physical reality. The POV is stable, but the focalizer's perceptions feel like a poet's construction rather than a landscape astrologer's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the mythic tone well. However, it occasionally relies on filter verbs ("I decided," "I felt," "I saw") that dilute the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and perfectly calibrated to the protagonist's worldview, blending technical terms ("tuples," "variables") with lyrical observation.

Dialogue is sparse and stylized, fitting the fable-like tone, though it risks sounding slightly performative rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a high-lyric register that fits the fable-like quality of the story. The tone is consistent, though occasionally borders on purple ("cadence that tides whisper"). The distinct perceptual signature of the tide dancer is well-maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct but monotonous in its poetic register, lacking variation between narration and dialogue. The characters speak in the same metaphorical dialect ("You commune with it... not asking"), reducing verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "poetic overload," where even casual dialogue carries the weight of a thesis statement. The insertion of prompt phrases into spoken lines ("during the slow dance of celestial bodies") breaks naturalism and distinctness. The result is a prose poem texture that distances the reader from the raw reality of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, successfully maintaining the "logical dreamer" persona throughout. However, the narrative distance remains somewhat static, observing the community's transformation from a removed, almost god-like perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, authoritative, and suitably elevated for a character who "endows what the market tolerates." The shift from cold calculation to the intimacy of the hatching ("tremor that said I belonged to it") is handled with excellent control of narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistently high-lyric and confident, matching the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is stable, though the relentless poeticism occasionally distances the reader from the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, successfully blending technical artistic language with emotional metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)

    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and highly polished, maintaining a lyrical intensity throughout. However, the relentless poeticism sometimes creates a distance, making the narrator feel more like a disembodied observer than a participant.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, fitting the "ghost whisperer" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and authoritative, maintaining a cohesive "sentinel" persona. The illusion wavers only when forced phrasing ("drawing parallels," "passionate subtlety") intrudes on the otherwise organic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)

    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, meditative tone appropriate for a music therapist.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but cloying, adopting a high-fable register that distances the reader. The "whimsical" tone is achieved through heavy adjective use rather than distinct perceptual bias or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is irreducibly specific: scientific register braided with salt-taste lyricism—“riverbeds left in the air,” “closed wild arithmetic.” Syntax mirrors the POV’s data habits: clauses stack like spectra, then cut to terse reports. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure (“I tape the worst cracks…”). Dialogue-free design is chosen and coherent; prose itself carries subtext and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyrical first-person sustains a glass-blower’s perceptual signature—heat timings, negative space, “cooling” as positive state—without drifting into poetry-slam. Syntax swells and contracts like breath: long sentence for valley exhale, fragment for frost vein. No head-hop; distance stays shallow and sensorial. Register stays artisanal; “furnaces once roared like small suns” is the most elevated phrase and is earned by craft pride.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature: every noun is filtered through post-sound physics—“rime,” “thermal,” “frost-lace”—syntax compresses under aurora light. No head-hopping; Sura’s silence is observed, not ventriloquized. Patterned elision (“the hush rolled in”) is taught early and paid off in final “answer rising without volume.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for aurora nights, staccato for fork-taps.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is a sustained maritime elegy—syntax lengthens and compresses like tide (e.g., “the sea grows patient and heavy, like an old librarian who has waited decades to speak”). Perceptual signature is consistent: coffin-maker’s eye sees “plot under grass with a marker that says, Here, stop.” No head-hopping; diction stays within undertaker’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-plural POV holds stable as a collective consciousness; no individuated interiority leaks. Perceptual signature is lyric-poetic—stars as coins, moon as rind, salt tasted on bell-rim—yet stays consistent with a community that metabolizes metaphor as daily speech. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for arbor reflections, clipped fragments during alley runs. Experimental compression (“amplified quiet”) is pattern-taught early and repaid in the final breath-image. One micro-slip: occasional poetic overload (“tide that learns the exact shape of the harbor”) risks register drift, but the cadence supports accumulative pressure, not obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent camera-obscura syntax: light corridors, salted emulsion, nebula-pressed paper. Rhythm modulates with inhale/exhale lengths; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric compressions (“tiny planets” of breath) are patterned early and paid off in the steadying inhale.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic blends (“air tastes like baked coins”), ticket-quills “hum,” piano lacks soundboard—details only this POV would notice. Rhythm compresses under stress—“I work quickly…”—then widens for memory of grandmother, mirroring strategic patience. No head-hopping; unreliability is hinted but never exploited gimmickly. One minor cadence echo: “I… I…” opens three sentences in 30-word span, a drumbeat that slightly flattens musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person synesthetic voice sustains a perceptual signature where color is always heard and silence has tint; diction stays within the lexicon of an acoustics engineer (“spectral notch,” “mitotic rhythms”) without drifting into jargon. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“I slid the old promise note…listened…whitening hiss”—then elongates in the orchard walk, mirroring the protagonist’s attention swing between fevered forging and exhausted acceptance. No head-hopping; unreliability is limited to the synesthetic bias, paid off when aurora misreads wonder as fracture. Dialogue lines are few but carry indirection: father’s “I trusted you to make it out” is both apology and self-absolution, heard by the aid as retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a controlled poetic cadence without sacrificing clarity; perceptual signature filters every observation through light-thief ontology.

No head-hopping; POV distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is dense, salt-licked, synesthetic: “grains clicked in her braids like soft teeth,” “syruped quietude poured from a wound in time.” Perceptual signature is obsessive-cartographic: distances, horizons, inlets, reefs are felt as emotional geometry.

No head-hop; distance stays tight to scribe’s sensory cortex; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)

Purposeful elision (exact procedure, city name) taught early and paid off when anonymity heightens the bureaucratic shrug emoji.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Hale’s perceptual signature—rivet-tuned diction, embered breath, long-vowel station hum. No head-hops; Sera’s interior is inferred only through fogged guard and single spoken line, preserving distance. Rhythmic control heightens at climax—fragments like “eased the lever back a breath” match the hush he chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person texture is viola-specific: breath measured in bow hair, chords “unstruck,” harmonic “cracked glass.” Syntax lengthens during submerged listening, then snaps into staccato commands when the exit is shouted. No filter-verb clutter; perception is direct (“lanterns spoke in shivers”). Elision of the ghost’s face is pattern-taught early and paid off by the blank moonlit silence. Voice never drifts into orchestral cliché; even “thunder in the pipes” is literal plumbing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is fever-cooled scientific lyric: POV notices in millibars, graphite veins, seismometer microflares—perceptual signature is unmistakable. Syntax compresses under fever (“my head cools along with the anemometers”) yet stays legible; patterned elision teaches itself by line 3. No head-hopping; anthropomorphic oracle remains externally observed, internally consistent. Final read-aloud cadence—roll call of instruments including Luca—flips grief into ritual without slipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice distinct: syntax elongates then compresses under pressure (“I slid down, reckless indeed, my light a tired moon”). Perceptual signature—“appraise their fear the way surveyors weigh slopes”—anchors narrator’s skeptical empiricist bent. No head-hop; diction stays within mill-explorer lexicon. Rhythm mirrors breath: long anaphoric sentences in tunnel hush, staccato descent into niche. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice is consistent, textured, and lexically lush—“maps deserve mercy,” “river licks it without wearing it down”—with rhythmic control that slows to match contemplative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves a distinct perceptual signature: verbs like “hushful,” “ingested,” “freight syllables” feel coined by a mind that tastes language metallically. Rhythm swells and narrows with sensory load—long anaphora when grain dust falls, staccato when diaries tremble—teaching the reader to read by ear. No head-hopping; focalization stays welded to the historian’s cochlear imagination. Register never drifts into academic gloss; even “conceptual repricing” is rendered as bone socket, bell rib.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lyric third-person hovers close to Mei’s perceptual signature—“glass cathedral built for dots of light”—and sustains rhythmic control through patterned elision. No head-hopping occurs; the collective chorus is rendered through external gesture and image, keeping focalization clean.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Ruan’s perceptual signature: “care that moved like a thumb over vellum.” Syntax mirrors loop logic—anaphora, chiasmus—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is inferred only through external cue (breath twice, uncoached). Voice remains distinct under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is perceptual signature incarnate: the narrator hears chalk-snaps as quarter-notes, feels sunset as “sunlight on snow”—a lexicon only a fortune-cookie poet would own. Syntax coils like the nautilus, long sentences tightening into fragments under breath-shortening cold. No dialogue, yet internal monologue carries subtextual percussion. Pattern-taught elision (“the hush deepens”) pays off in the final held tone; compression never breaks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person texture is unmistakable: “stones still remembered light,” “rain slowed to single notes spaced like decisions.” Syntax coils under pressure—compressed clauses mimic breathless float; longer cadence arrives with stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)

No head-hopping; Risto remains opaque, shown only through gesture. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (‘she imagined’) and paid off in closure. Rhythm mirrors content: long sentences swell like inhalations, then break into drum-beat fragments. Diction stays within a music teacher’s vernacular; no corporate register slips. Dialogue is minimal but indirection-rich: the silence between them teaches.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.6)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: wind is read by “sideways drift,” silence has “manners,” sky practices indecision. Syntax mirrors meteorological patience—long accretive clauses that suddenly shear into short forecasts (“I would go once more”). No filter-verb stacks; every perception is tactile (salt crust, velvet motor). Dialogue—in the single spoken exchange—is laconic, regionally neutral, and carries subtext about selling weather; voice convergence at closure reads intentional rather than slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drifting poet’s diction is lyric yet grounded (“ear for tender static,” “starpit overhead”); rhythmic variation mirrors emotional tides, no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early and paid off in closure; voice stays singular, idiosyncratic, and read-aloud musical.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to acoustic texture; every metaphor is sonic (“drops answer back,” “bow scratches stars,” “bell yields cracked honey”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short fragments during fire-start, lengthened cadences during bell descent. No head-hopping; collective “we” in closing line is a stable Charged Poise, not POV drift. Elision (“she tunes by listening…”) taught early and paid off in every subsequent tuning act.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is irreducibly particular: “static leaves me briefly clean, then uncarved again.” Syntax mirrors diagnostic precision—calibrated amperage, scent memory, rhythm of breath—yet cadence softens for Liora’s entrance, a hearth-breath.

Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within plausible broker lexicon. Final line cadence earns Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice is a chisel: “my pencil listen before it moves” compresses sight, sound, and intent into one clause. Perceptual signature is illustrator-specific—pressure rendered by shading, anatomy sought in impossible creatures—never generic lyric. Rhythm tightens under stress: single-sentence paragraph “The giant snores…” becomes a metrical stumble that mirrors the interrupted cadence. No head-hop, no register drift; diction stays inside an artist who thinks in graphite and water.

    Perceptual signature is relentless: mineral radiance, decimal pauses, velvet pupil reflections—diction never leaves the conjurer’s lexicon.

No head-hopping; POV distance stays consistent inside duct walls. Lyric elision (“routes, not steps”) is taught in paragraph 1 and paid off in the final atlas-case motion. Dialogue minimal, natural, sub-textual: “You found it” carries full weight of expected miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person botanist voice owns a perceptual signature: rain smells of wet limestone, veins are “routes under the skin,” ledger lines up like “seed flats in a pivoted sun.” Syntax is long-breathing, comma-riven, mirroring storm-surge thinking; final sentences shorten into acceptance. No dialogue chunks to test voice convergence; Theo’s brief spoken line fits apprentice shyness. Compression (“I wanted mastery, but the trellis taught me stewardship”) is earned, not shortcut, because causal trail of leaf and moss precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice carries a painterly perceptual signature: tide “slid back like a tired lung,” pumps “sighed to sleep,” cistern “a black coin.” Rhythm modulates—compressed when cold “pointed inland,” expansive during fresco description—mirroring insomnia’s oscillations. No head-hopping; Mara’s dialogue stays external, filtered through painterly metaphors. Syntax reflects profession: brush-stroke sentences, color-drenched nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)

Dialogue minimal but natural, subtext intact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)

    First-person lyric accumulates cadence through anaphora and maritime consonants—“gulls are overseers, cranes are metronomes”—taught immediately. Perceptual signature is haptic-acoustic, never visual-catalog. Filter verbs (“I felt”) are voice-motivated, not hedging. No dialogue to distort; internal diction stays within dockhand lexicon. Closure cadence slows, mirroring tidal inhale.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice is distinct: “laughing softly so the wind would not worry,” “gloomy cheerfulness like a borrowed coat.” Perceptual signature filters every object through tactile acoustics—tide breath, chalk snow, creaking footstep pulses.

Syntax flexes from long braid-sentences to staccato drum commands without losing control. No dialogue, so no convergence issue; diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon except one moment of “conceptual repricing” register trespass, forgiven at once.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice carries a scientist-poet diction—“meteors and reactions instead of clocks”—that remains within the crater inspector’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with exposure lengths, mirroring photographic breath. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. The slight rise in lyric register at closure is earned by the earlier mentor echo.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mara’s auditory field; every descriptor is something she could weigh by ear or fingertip—“iron prayers,” “magnetic calm,” “slack tide.” Sentence rhythm mimics sonar: long waves of clause, then sharp pings of noun-verb—“Track Three sang hollow.” No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; even Jaro’s visual reports are rendered as spoken sound. The voice is specific enough that removing Mara would collapse the entire timbre of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The atlas-editor voice owns every syllable: “stovetop kettle,” “weathered paper” hardtack, “long syntax” breath. Syntax tightens under pressure—“I kneel... I scrape... I lower”—then relaxes into longer contemplative coils, mirroring cold-induced breath rhythm. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays embodied. The falcon’s “clacked dictation” is the only speaker, yet still sounds avian, not human ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, syntactic parallelism mirroring the walkers’ circling: “Left, pause, right, pause.” Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible awe—“wild hush,” “smoke-dark hum”—never drifting into academic gloss.

Metaphors stay tidal-consistent (obsidian, surf, heron) and mutually reinforce rather than compete. No synonym churn or template cadence; openings vary from participial to noun-phrase to keep the read-aloud ear engaged. One microscopic lapse: “luminous scars” edges toward luxe diction, but the phrase is earned by prior star-imprint and occurs at closure where heightened register is justified.

Rhythmic propulsion mirrors the approaching storm.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains scholar’s lexicon—“ledger of eclipses,” “eventless spaces”—without trespassing into omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.5)
    Voice is irreducibly specific: “brightened disquiet,” “tender mathematics,” “simply complicated.” Syntax mirrors curator-archivist mind—nested clauses like catalog entries, then fracture into short beats under pressure (*“Ask,” it answered*).
