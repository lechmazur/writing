    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liora's perspective. Voice carries a consistent lyric-noir texture through controlled diction ("luminous glass artist," "scorched testament," "weight of silence") that suits the character and mood. The dialogue exchange with Jaren is spare and carries subtext (his deflection, her insistence). Perceptual signature is strong: she notices patterns in frost, traces ink "as familiar as the scars on her wrists." Distance remains consistent with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV third-person limited on Elias is stable. Perceptual signature is present ("silence vast and suffocating," "vibrations he could almost remember") though not highly character-particular. Liora's dialogue is functional; her line "You're trying to translate silence into music" reads slightly expository. Filter verbs ("watched," "feeling") appear but remain voice-consistent. Prose modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the undertaker notices funerary details ("coffins too small," "prayers into ears that no longer heard") and interprets the lens through his professional lens of distress signals and rest. Diction is elevated but consistent ("the thought settled in his chest like a stone," "the city holding its breath"). No head-hopping. However, the narration occasionally slips into mild exposition ("Occupying impossible spaces had always been his gift") that tells rather than dramatizes. The prose modulates well under pressure, tightening at the logbook discovery and expanding into lyric calm at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Liora's priorities: the arbor as sanctuary, the elderly's trembling hands, the children's wide eyes. Perceptual signature is consistent (touching, listening, carrying). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Diction is slightly elevated ("dusk bled into twilight," "amplified quiet") but coherent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and carries subtext: "Why do they give us things if we don't know who they are?" / "Because some things don't need names." The girl's question advances theme without preaching. One faint register slip: "the unspoken bond between those who gave and those who received" reads slightly abstract for Liora's concrete idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Lien's perceptual signature—light, souls, breathing, memory—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is elevated and lyric ("drowned thing rising," "communion," "sparkles were in her") without register clash, fitting the meditative tone. The father's dialogue is minimal and raw ("Please"), contrasting with Lien's interior richness. However, the phrase "revealing through breathing changes" reads as meta-commentary inserted for prompt alignment rather than organic discovery, and the final paragraph's explanatory clarity ("she had shown the father where his love had been stored all along") slightly flattens the distance that held through the earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara throughout; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the street-scene encounter with her mother. Diction is elevated and consistent ("hyperbolic geometry," "retrocognitively trapped"), though occasionally tips into academic register ("a paradox: alive in the past, yet lingering in the present like a stain") that edges beyond what a grieving maze designer would frame mid-crisis. The dialogue exchange with the mother is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You shouldn't be here" / "I know"), but the mother's voice lacks distinct idiom—she could be any ghost. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure (short, clipped beats during the street scene; longer, lyric cadences in the garden restoration), and no head-hopping mars the focus.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited through Mira is stable and her perceptual filtering (watching Vey sort keys "like musical notes," understanding the arrow's message) shows active interpretation. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Vey's quiet authority ("You don't want to impede us") and his terse instructions maintain consistency. The prose modulates well under pressure—chains "clinked with every step, a sound that made her teeth ache" embodies sensory stress. One slip: "the weight of hope had already begun to unravel them" drifts into abstract poeticism that doesn't match Mira's otherwise concrete register.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is lyric, image-dense, and maintains a melancholic register throughout. POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under emotional pressure (the wife's lie, the forge work). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor that strains the focalizer's immediacy: "their hulls split open like overripe fruit," "bruised purples and sickly greens," "colors no one else could hear" feel more authorial than character-specific. Filter verbs ("he swore he could hear," "he had always thought") are present but not intrusive. The prose reflects Elias's technical background (soldering, hearing aids) but leans poetic in peak beats, reducing perceptual signature specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV tracks Lira cleanly with no head-hopping. Psychic distance stays intimate, filtering station details through her thief-of-light lens. Diction leans ornate ("destiny's door," "golden-hour portrait thief," "curator of fleeting light") in a way that feels authorial rather than Lira's lived idiom under pressure; the elevated register flattens during the Kael exchange when plainspoken dialogue ("You're either a poet or a spy") clashes with the surrounding lyricism. Dialogue subtext is thin—Kael's lines deliver information and thematic cues rather than pursuing oblique goals. Free indirect style remains stable, but voice distinction between narration and Lira's interiority blurs into a single poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance remains consistent. Voice carries distinct texture: "the heat of the furnace would burn away the parts of him that needed people," "old ghosts." The dramatic narration passage ("First, the power must be stabilized") introduces a purposeful shift into performed monologue that reflects his glassblowing pedagogy. However, the phrase "thoughtfully spirited—too curious for his own good" reads as externalized label rather than enacted perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (glass artist's eye on cracks, calibration) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; psychic distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("slithering through her fingers," "honed on the whetstone of necessity") but remains mostly grounded. The caretaker's dialogue ("You shouldn't be here") and Mira's reply feel natural. Internal voice is character-specific (the stunt-double past, the phobia metaphor "gnawed at her ribs like a trapped rat"). No head-hopping. Minor: "firmly adaptive" arrives as exposition rather than shown syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered consistently through the oracle's attention. Perceptual signature—"mildly obsessed," focus on texture and rhythm—is clear. Diction is controlled and distinctive ("marbled hush," "ambered hush"), though elevated register occasionally drifts from urgent immediacy ("ее motivation had always been to draw this map"). No dialogue to assess. Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts. Compression at peak beats ("by summarizing silence") maintains voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV distance is stable; robotic focalization filters sensory input distinctly ("polished alloy chassis humming," "audio receptors"). Diction suits the narrator ("amalgamate fragments of time," "neural pathways") without clinical excess. Rhythm modulates well—short bursts during loop iteration, longer cadence at resolution. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "Probably not. But that was the beauty of it" flattens into editorializing ease under what should be peak uncertainty, briefly losing the robotic perceptual signature. Otherwise, voice remains controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mira as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct ("glistened," "ambiguously clear," "words were simple, but they carried the weight") with purposeful syntax. Dialogue advances plot and carries subtext ("You're not supposed to." / "I was going to put it back." / "You're lying."), and the exchange feels goal-driven. Minor issue: Elias and Mira's internal idiom converge slightly at the ending ("tired of pretending") without strong voice distinction, though the compression is brief and acceptable under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (reading cracks "as if reading a story," seeing marbles as offerings) is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains within his lexicon—reverent, deliberate, slightly archaic ("gnarled fingers," "withered vine")—and modulates naturally under pressure. Two brief moments edge toward elevated register ("coaxing life from stubborn soil," "time after luck became measurable" introduced without grounding) but do not break voice. No dialogue present; interior rhythm supports the accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's perceptual signature—mechanic's precision, focus on thermal regulators and frequency syncing—establishes a distinct filter. Phrases like "shimmering distortion in the air, like heat haze given form" and "hush so profound it felt like the universe itself was holding its breath" show purposeful compression and lyric reach. However, diction slips into elevated register ("delusions of grandeur," "lateral logic") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The prose maintains single-POV focus with no head-hopping, and the final laugh lands as an embodied micro-choice, but the lexicon doesn't fully cohere under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Lena's perception throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, filtering description through her musician's awareness (recognizing notes, reading the program's margins). Perceptual signature is present but thin—Lena notices water, light, and spectral shapes without a strong idiosyncratic lens. Diction remains clean and within register, though some phrases ("potential of one," "in-between—the space between the notes") drift toward conceptual exposition rather than embodied thought. No dialogue to assess. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (breath hitched, fingers closed) but lacks rhythmic variation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with clear psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices fragments, edges, and margins ("peripherally aware," "like a reflection in rippling water"). Diction remains consistent with his introspective, pattern-seeking mindset. Free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: terse action during the descent, reflective texture in the station. Slight register drift in "auroral sorrow" and "the grip of a certainty that wasn't theirs to hold"—elevated phrasing that strains against the established voice but remains legible and purposeful. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"his flashlight cutting through the dust like a knife through stale bread," "drowsy alertness sharpening"—and psychic distance modulates with pressure. The phrase "religiously skeptical" and the late-arriving psychic-radio callback feel slightly forced in register. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he thought") are acceptable but cluster in peak beats without voice necessity. Elision (the unspecified "truth") is purposeful but not fully paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: "gnarled as the roots threading the overgrown library's stone shelves," "a regenerative silence, like the slow healing of a wound no one else could see." Psychic distance is stable, free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature—silence as presence, reality as malleable—is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains within the keeper's elevated, meditative register throughout. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates subtly with emotional beats (shallow breath when she finds the new book, the careful closure of it), and the final paragraph's rhythm decelerates purposefully to match the return to witness-mode.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a lyric, folk-tale texture ("mountains cradled the valley like a lullaby," "beneath the hush of dreaming roots"). Dialogue is minimal and functional; Liora's "You're him" and request to play feel natural but carry little subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into writerly register ("cautious exuberance," "collective awe into something tangible") that sits atop rather than inside Elias's interiority. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, third-limited, remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "the way shadows pooled too long in corners" and traces spines "as if they were pulse points," idiom consistent with her role and sensitivity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during tactile moments (pressing palm, brushing threads), slightly wider in reflective beats without head-hopping. Prose rhythm reflects her contemplative stance: "The silo groaned, its bones shifting in the wind." No dialogue present; interior voice is character-specific and controlled under rising pressure, with compression at the threshold ("It wasn't a pattern. It was a door.") that sharpens rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV Elias with stable third-limited distance and a clean perceptual signature (salt on rocks, beam as metronome). Dialogue between Elias and the woman carries goal-driven subtext and distinct rhythms. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The woman's voice feels slightly generic ("Because the song's changing") compared to Elias's texture, and peak-moment diction ("orchestrated this") edges toward exposition. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent; the piece demonstrates controlled focalization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "violet on his lips felt heavy," "the anchor groaned." Diction is voice-consistent (archaic register: "hollowed-out husk," "poorly stitched shroud") and purposeful compression ("Before the possession completes" as refrain). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats—"To illuminate hidden assumptions" and "muffled clarity of truth, half-heard, half-felt" read as thematic statement rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose reflects the ritual frame but occasionally sacrifices immediacy for lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices dawn light, shell ridges, breath fog—textures of permanence and transience. Diction remains within her register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose modulates with her emotional arc (bitter laugh → quiet remembering). No dialogue present. Voice is distinct and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with appropriate narrative distance (he "knew then what he had to do" fits his reflective register). Perceptual signature is present but not always character-particular—"the weight of something unsaid" and "mad cartographer" feel more authorial than Elias's specific way of noticing. The scarred-self dialogue ("You've come to kill me") is clean and goal-driven, but Elias's replies are elided, reducing on-page voice distinction. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("permutations," "labyrinth of self") without clear grounding in Elias's idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable, anchored in Elias's tactile perceptual signature (heartbeat, shiver of air) and Mira's raw need. The sign-language exchange is efficient and subtext-laden ("You want to record nothing?" / "Not nothing. The hush."). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though occasional phrases ("the hollow ache inside her," "the echo of her transformation") drift toward generalized interiority rather than character-specific idiom. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening at the drum tap and opening slightly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's scholarly profession, with strong sensory texture ("the air smelling of wet moss and distant thunder," "salt and something metallic, like old coins left in the rain"). POV discipline is clean with no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable. Some phrases approach overwriting ("the last light of dusk bled into shadow") and the diction occasionally tips into abstract elevation ("the unshakable sense of being observed") where more concrete perception would sharpen urgency, but the perceptual signature—measuring, analytical, attuned to atmospheric detail—remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters sensory detail through Lirien's poet lens ("texture of time…as one might a lover's skin"). Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent, though at peak beats some phrasing feels polished rather than urgent ("Her heart pounded, but her mind was clear"). The grotto "holding its breath" and the rope "burned cold" show purposeful figurative compression. No head-hopping, and psychic distance remains controlled. The voice is distinct but occasionally slips into prompt echo ("ethically playful…a trait that had saved her") and thematic ventriloquism in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: Liora notices sound, texture, and light filtered through her musician's focus. Diction is controlled and lyric without head-hopping. However, several filter verbs ("she had heard," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy, and the final paragraph tells insight ("she knew") rather than dramatizing it. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains appropriate and voice is distinct, though some phrasing leans toward poetic assertion rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, with a consistent register ("breath of dusk," "ghost of feeling," "ink bleeding through parchment") that feels purposeful rather than overwrought. The POV remains stable in close third on Liora, and her perceptual signature—filtering sensation through detachment and professional assessment—is clear. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext in Darian's "You're late" and Liora's "Grief" as shorthand. Minor slip: "subsume the air" (line ~13) feels like a verb error or register mismatch (possibly "suffuse" or "subsume" misapplied), briefly disrupting the otherwise smooth diction. No head-hopping, and psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable, and Elias's perceptual bias (noticing unseen contributors) shapes his observations. The dialogue between Elias and Mara carries subtext and goal pursuit cleanly. However, diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") that reads more authorial than interior to a cargo broker under moderate pressure. Psychic distance is controlled and the prose reflects the character's stance without major filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, third-limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Liora notices glass edges, hollow echoes, the arbor's "living light"). Dialogue is sparse but functional and carries subtext ("Some say the tag only appears when you're ready"). Prose modulates under pressure when the arbor blazes. Minor register drift: "boldly sympathetic" and "luminescent ache" feel slightly elevated for a marsh-reed sculptor's internal lexicon, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices tactile vibrations, hears whispers in water, feels the pendant's warmth. Diction remains consistent ("breathless instant," "slithered through the canals") and voice-appropriate. The whisper dialogue ("You're late") feels purposeful and eerie. Minor issue: "She believed—no, she *knew*" is a filter clarification that slightly over-explains her certainty rather than trusting the reader to infer it from action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias throughout. Diction is controlled and atmospheric: "the unmeasurable," "fractal patterns of feeling," "the shape of her laughter, the ghost of her hand." Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices texture (bark, smooth glass, chipped stone) and emotional metaphor (sunlight through stained glass). No head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation supports the accumulative pressure: short beats tighten at "The orchard answered," then the final paragraph breathes out. One brief filter cluster ("felt a pull," "understood then") is acceptable given voice coherence and no peak-beat obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "dust motes swirling," the scent of lemon oil, emergency lights casting "long shadows like fingers." His interior voice is specific ("That was the problem with sense memories—they made you ache"). Diction remains consistent under pressure. Mara's brief dialogue ("Hello?") and her tag ("soft but clear") fit naturalism. Purposeful elision (we infer his years of watching) does not obscure present stakes. The only slip: "He'd found it weeks ago" shifts briefly into summary when the tape's initial discovery could anchor more tightly in the present urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is horticulturalist-specific (leaf veins, bark texture, soil temperature). Diction stays within Mara's expertise without unmotivated register drift. The phrase "circuitously sincere, this metamorphosis" reads as narrator overlay rather than Mara's idiom under pressure, a brief voice slip. Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and the closing rhythm ("The rain fell harder, but she didn't move") controls pacing effectively. No dialogue present; focal distance tightens appropriately during the transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, anchored to the painter's perceptual signature: he notices amber resin, rain trails, the warmth of objects, and reads the island through an artist's lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the cave discovery. The woman's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("A key. Or a lock. Depends on what you're trying to open") and her wryly earnest tone contrasts with his exhausted interiority. One slip: "threshing meaning from experience" in her speech feels more like authorial theme delivery than natural dialogue, briefly breaking voice naturalism in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV third with stable psychic distance; diction is character-particular ("bright darkness," "the world had peeled back its skin"). Elias's perceptual signature—noticing magic in mundane fragments—is consistent and selective. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the pilgrim's "Not the way the shadows would twist" carries urgency and subtext. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose modulates appropriately under stress ("his fingers closed on empty air"). No head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains controlled throughout. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he realized," "he gasped") slightly dulls immediacy at peak moments but does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Liora's perceptual signature—archivist filtering sensory detail through salt, parchment, echoes—is consistent. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; Dain's exchange ("Did you find it?" / "Third one's in the old watchtower") advances plot efficiently. However, both characters speak in similarly clipped, utilitarian cadences with no distinct idiom to separate them; under pressure their voices converge. Free indirect style is clean, and diction stays within Liora's plausible register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—noticing precise angles in pavement cracks, the weight and hum of the punch—feels character-specific and analytically artistic. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the punch examination, pulling back slightly for spatial navigation. The conductor's dialogue carries subtext ("Not because you're the best, but because you're the only one") and her voice is distinct from narration. Diction remains controlled; no unmotivated register shifts. One minor slip: "trembling certainty" appears in the opening but doesn't fully permeate the prose rhythm under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; psychic distance narrows appropriately under emotional pressure ("breath hitched," "hands trembling"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias filters sensory input through skepticism softening to wonder. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon, though phrases like "sculpting space for reflection" and "vessel for kindness" tilt slightly elevated for a moment of visceral discovery. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose carries a distinct, slightly lyric texture that modulates cleanly with the intensifying whale songs and tile glow. Rhythm control under pressure is strong, with sentence length varying purposefully to reflect urgency and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature (dimensional awareness, prismatic light) is character-specific. Dialogue between Veyra and Kael is functional and goal-driven but lacks subtext or distinct idiom; both speak in equally articulate, declarative sentences ("You shouldn't have taken that," "What do you want?"). The prose carries a heightened register ("achingly profound," "hushed thunder") that occasionally drifts into generic fantasy diction without voice-motivated texture. Free indirect style is clean, and the final paragraph modulates toward acceptance without losing focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices the ink pot's chipped rim, the woman's "trapped" eyes, and codes objects as con tools. Dialogue carries subtext ("You're trespassing" / "I need what he had") and advances the negotiation. Voice modulates under pressure: the opening's leisurely catalog ("a scent that clung to Elias like a second skin") tightens to clipped exchanges at closure. Minor slip: "the dead watched him from their steel tables" is a stock phrase that doesn't feel Elias-particular. The woman's voice ("This isn't how it works") is distinct from Elias's dryer register, but her single scene limits full voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature (gilded paper "like captured sunlight," histories "twisting like branches"). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, voice modulates little under the minimal pressure—the reflective register and metaphoric density remain uniform from opening to closure. The piece teaches a lyric, meditative pattern early and holds it, so the steady texture is legible rather than a flaw, but the lack of rhythmic shift or compression at the peak moment (the final writing) limits the sense of stakes charging the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited voice is stable and textured with lyric specificity ("leaf caught in a storm," "ghosts," "cathedral"). POV modesty holds: Elias infers but does not claim certainty beyond his vantage. The woman's brief dialogue ("Names are just labels we outgrow") carries subtext and her speech rhythm feels distinct from the narrator's internal register. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during high-pressure beats (crouching in muck, touching the scratched letters). No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a consistent perceptual signature: Elias notices peeling murals, chipped paint, the scent of damp stone. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the vision sequences. No head-hopping. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific. The phrase "the sky outgrew their curiosity" and "the myth had reimagined him" show syntactic flair, though the latter edges toward elevated register at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and voice is consistent, filtering the carnival through Lan's dual perspective. Perceptual signature is present: "She could slip from the raucous chaos... to the quiet precision of the raft's hidden archives." The graffiti decoding and tactical orchestration reflect her orderly-intuitive lens. However, some diction drifts into elevated register ("perpetual revelry," "bacchanal") that feels slightly external to a sixteen-year-old's immediate thought. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping, and narrative certainty matches what Lan can know.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: lyric diction ("blue light bleeding over the lunar horizon like a slow-dying ember") and reflective cadence suit Elias's contemplative stance. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor filter-verb clustering ("watching his breath fog," "watching the readout flicker") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats, but voice remains coherent and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's tactile and auditory perception. Psychic distance is controlled; knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Mara's lines advancing the beat without distraction. Diction is consistent and apt ("compass," "second heartbeat"), though a few phrases edge toward the generic ("weight of the moment," "thick with something like awe"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Mira's perceptual signature—atlas-editor precision, dry wit, the way she "corrected borders with the same precision others used to stir tea"—is distinctive and consistent. Distance modulates purposefully from close interior ("The words had settled into her chest like a stone") to wider atmospheric framing. The keeper's dialogue is spare and naturalistic, contrasting with Mira's more considered syntax. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she knew better," "Mira knew") is acceptable for voice, not intrusive. No head-hopping or tense drift. The prose rhythm supports pressure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited distance remains stable; the narrator tracks the tuner's perception and craft without head-hopping. Diction is controlled and ornate ("cloak the color of old bruises," "wild hush," "shimmer that traced the paths") with consistent elevation fitting a fable register, though some constructions ("he believed," "he knew") lean toward filter verbs without voice-specific justification. Perceptual signature is consistent—craft-focused, attuned to vibration and rhythm—though the tuner's internal texture remains somewhat generic. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression (seven-day montage, ellipsis of meals/sleep) serves the Accumulative lens and remains legible. Minor register consistency slips (e.g., "infinitely patient" as narrator assertion rather than dramatized trait) do not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Lira's urgency and isolation. Perceptual signature is character-specific: technical details (rebreather, life support hum, oxygen gauge) anchor her salvage-diver lens. Psychic distance tightens effectively in the final chamber. The prose carries a distinct texture—"salt-laced dark," "honeyed poison," "motes of light"—that modulates with pressure. Free indirect style is clean in the diver's telepathic speech; the italicized lines read as the temple "filling in the gaps" without head-hopping. Minor slips: "loneliness gnawed at her ribs like a starving thing" leans slightly ornamental, and the final paragraph's "The abyss would remember her" edges toward elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (he notices the lattice hum, the door sway, the shape's suggestion of limbs). Diction is purposeful and atmospheric ("copperlight repose," "hush coil around his throat") but occasionally veers into elevated metaphor ("silence so thick it could smother a scream") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt the hush coil") are acceptable within voice. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains controlled. The final lines shift toward summary ("he would keep running") rather than staying in scene, slightly diluting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is selective (she notices soil texture, warmth of the bead, the bride's bone-colored gown). Diction stays consistent and lyric without register drift. The bride's voicelessness ("only the echo of a voice...if her throat had been filled with thorns") is filtered through Liora's perception rather than omniscient assertion. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (vision sequence) without head-hopping. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is distinct (poetic wharf weaver filtering the world through textile and water metaphors). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("hauntingly optimistic," "splinter in her chest"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts ("via overlapping sleepwalking paths" reads authorial rather than character-bound). The voice modulates with emotional intensity but some figurative language feels ornamental rather than urgent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct archeological-lyric register ("wound in the earth," "library of the dead"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices roots, frescoes, and ritual objects through an antiquarian lens. Occasional elevations ("her robes woven from sunlight and shadow") fit the enchantment tone. Psychic distance compresses slightly at the woman's appearance but remains controlled. No dialogue on the page except the woman's two lines, which carry subtext (validation of the journey). Minor filter-verb reliance ("I felt the weight") in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Elias's interiority. The voice carries a distinct texture with measured, slightly formal diction ("cathedral of forgotten dreams," "pseudonym creator") that suits a character who traffics in names and codes. The mother's single line of dialogue ("You always were too clever for your own good") feels natural and goal-driven, though we don't get enough exchange to test full subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor diction slips: "nothing if not carefully inventive" reads slightly labored, and "chest tighten" lacks the article for smoothness.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("gnawing certainty," "echoed silence"), fitting an observatory embroiderer's interior world. However, perceptual signature is generic—Liora notices patterns but her way of seeing doesn't feel character-particular beyond her craft. The brief dialogue ("The stars do not lie") serves the plot but carries minimal subtext. Psychic distance stays steady; no filter-verb stacks or register drift, but also no rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the apparition encounter. Perceptual signature is consistent—Liora notices warmth, salt, condensation patterns—and diction stays within her lexicon (no filter-verb stacks or register drift). The apparition's dialogue ("You came," "You still don't," "That's the moment") is spare and carries subtext without over-explanation. Narrative stance modulates with emotional intensity: calm description → spirits' song swells → quiet closure, maintaining coherence and rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent (translator's eye for patterns, smudged notes as palimpsest) and vocabulary fits her professional register. Diction modulates appropriately: clinical precision ("radius," "mortar strike") gives way to lyric compression at the ending ("lotus-hearted ache"). The prose avoids filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" is narrator-voiced rather than Lena's self-perception, creating a brief distance flicker. Otherwise, voice control under pressure is strong, and the final image sustains the established rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liora's perceptual signature (noticing light, texture, emotional lodging of images). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "her breath curling like smoke," "splinter," "liquid gold." The old woman's dialogue ("You didn't just display it…") feels slightly expository—articulating theme—but remains plausible as elder-artist reflection. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively between lyric observation and concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual filters ("his colleagues called it a flaw, this habit of turning every restoration into a game of 'what if'"). Diction is elevated and ornate ("bewitched the stone, turning it pliable as wet clay") but remains consistent and voice-motivated for an art restorer's perspective. The piece teaches a lyric compression pattern early. Minor issue: "Elias would have sworn to that" is a filter insertion that momentarily distances the reader from the moment's immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited on Elias maintains stable distance and perceptual signature (entomologist's noticing: "orchids that bloomed in spirals, vines trained to curl into runes"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit well, especially Quill's charm and evasion with the inspector. However, voice occasionally drifts into elevated register not quite matched to Elias's interiority ("the picture of ease," "charged with meaning"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "Why me?" / "Because you're the only one…" reads slightly expository for the relationship dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Perceptual signature is strong: he reads ocean projections "like a second language," notices "reef-shadow joy," tastes brine and crushed coral. Diction elevates appropriately for a poet's consciousness ("gargantuan shell loomed...cathedral of salt and silence"). However, register occasionally slips into ornamental excess—"shyly unstoppable," "ensconce," "photosynthesize pain"—that feels more like prompt-element insertion than organic thought under the 73-day insomnia strain. Filter verbs ("thought of," "wondering if") are present but not excessive. The closing shift to cosmic perspective ("where they would drift across centuries") widens psychic distance purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Liora's perceptual filter (precision, patience, sensitivity to light and sound) colors the narration consistently. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("prismatic whispers," "petrified into something cold and beautiful") but remains within the voice of someone shaped by thirty-seven years among relics. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is controlled; the piece stays anchored in Liora's sensory and reflective world without head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual filtering through Elara's scholarly lens (words "curling like smoke," "linguistic harmonies"). Diction is elevated but consistent with her register. The ancient voice's direct-quote interruptions are clean and purposeful. Minor slips: "her heart pounding with cautious exuberance" in the final paragraph tells the tone element rather than embodying it, and "the moment before paths diverge" reads slightly abstract for peak pressure. Free indirect style is controlled, and psychic distance modulates appropriately from tense focus to reflective close.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent (calloused fingers, love of the amphitheater's breath). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("encrypted compassion," "slyly heartfelt") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The prose modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to the charged letter-reading beat. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she had always loved") appear but do not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Elias's musicologist-turned-trainer lens. Perceptual signature: tracing spines "like a blind man reading braille," dust motes as "tiny worlds." Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Lena's voice distinct ("most people use graphs"). Minor register slip: "All sharp angles, but her eyes were soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again" feels slightly essayistic for the focalizer's stress level. Psychic distance modulates purposefully around revelation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Elias's perceptual signature—grain-focused, memory-laden—remains consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("featherly determined," "fractured hush swallowing his footsteps") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, particularly under emotional pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during reflection. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm supports atmospheric tone, though the voice lacks strong idiosyncrasy; it reads competent and mood-appropriate but not indelibly distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ghostly glow," "dying star," "tide") but occasionally slips into stock wonder-genre phrasing ("something akin to peace"). Liora's single line of dialogue ("We have to go") is functional but does not carry subtext or reveal stance. Narrative distance holds, and focalization is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction ("sea-foam recollectionist," "cheerful gloom") is voice-specific and stable. The prose maintains a meditative cadence that modulates appropriately when pressure rises (shorter clauses in the tunnel). Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated. One registration wobble: "transliterated" and "recollectionist" feel ornamental rather than idiomatic to the focalizer's lived lexicon, slightly distancing the reader from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (Lira notices patterns, embers, laughter). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally reaches for elevated register ("liminal space," "orchestrated serendipity") that feels slightly above the POV's lived texture during peak physicality. The phrase "serenade the dullness" and "ordering randomness" read more authorial than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal but natural; the violinist's silent acceptance and grin convey subtext effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Liora's dancer's perceptual signature (toes curling on stone, watching gaps between stars). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven: "Where?" and "Here" advance the choice without exposition. Voice modulates well under pressure—sentences compress when the tattooing begins. Two slips: the man's constellation-inked skin "shifted when he moved, as if the night sky had been pressed into his flesh" is vivid but the repeated "as if" construction (used three times in quick succession) flattens rhythm. Filter verbs ("watching," "seemed") are present but not intrusive. The narrative distance stays controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV control is clean; Elias's perceptual signature (reading grain, customer voices, now water patterns) is specific and consistent. The dialogue with the old woman feels purposeful and goal-driven, with her cold fingers and warm breath embodying the scene. Psychic distance is stable, and diction ("skeletal cathedral," "spectral shards") fits the contemplative register. Filter verbs ("thought he saw," "felt the pull") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift mars the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third around Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (professional observation layered with personal grief). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure: "liquid mercury," "hollow eyes," "seam where a voice had been stitched shut" all feel voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("Tell me what you lost"). One minor slip: "the hard edges of his own grief soften, just a little" edges toward summary rather than showing the shift through perception or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("lucidly watchful," "stubborn precision," "whispered in the same breath") is lyric and consistent, establishing a contemplative register. Filter verbs ("she wondered," "she decided," "she understood") are frequent but voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains controlled. No dialogue. The final epiphany ("In that moment, she understood") borders on over-articulation but fits the philosophical voice established throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable single-perspective with strong perceptual signature: Elias notices ivy's grip, faint vibrations, and feverish stone in character-specific ways. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the woman's lines carry subtext and pursue revelation. Free indirect style is clean and diction fits the cartographer's vocabulary. One minor register slip: "climate shifts had drowned cities" reads as omniscient summary rather than Elias's present-tense knowledge. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close observation to broader reflection without head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct texture—architectural metaphors, careful spatial detail—that feels voice-motivated and legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the mirage...flickered at the edges of perception," "the dusky harmony of the hour." POV remains stable in close third, filtering setting and memory through Liora's artistic sensibility. The dialogue between Liora and the watchman carries subtext ("I come to listen to the bells" / "I come to hear what comes before them") and feels natural. Minor pattern: "borrowed" and "echoed" recur across beats without evolving meaning, and some figurative language ("breath held too long," "coded messages") leans toward stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV is stable; Liora's perceptual signature (negotiator's lens, weary specificity) is consistent. "Operatively gentle" and the clipboard's tactile presence anchor voice in purposeful detail. Dialogue is sparse but natural, pursuing goals obliquely (Kessar tests her commitment, Liora deflects with pragmatism). Psychic distance modulates intentionally at peak beats (her grip tightens, breath taken before final line). No head-hopping or filter clutter; the monks' chant provides atmospheric closure without POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and often striking ("the way it still hummed with the ghost of a song no living ear had ever heard"). Distance modulates purposefully, drawing close for the sentimental drawer and pulling back for the engineered drought. However, register occasionally drifts upward ("manufactured sort, a slow, deliberate unraveling") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, and some lines ("as if the bird inside had only just stopped breathing") lean ornamental rather than voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent elevated register that matches a poetic, temple-courtesan frame. Psychic distance holds close throughout. However, diction frequently drifts into generic lyricism—"the moment stretched between sigh and smile," "alarming serenity"—that reads more like atmospheric furniture than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("feeling the echoes," "letting their echoes fill") slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-consistent. The perceptual signature is mood-driven rather than idiosyncratically selective.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and elevated, fitting an urbane calligrapher's register. Perceptual signature is present (ink-stained fingers, precision vs. ivy metaphor). Psychic distance is controlled. However, reflection dominates (~50% of text) and some phrasing trends abstract ("half-lit epiphanies," "meteor hush of distant waves"). No dialogue to test voice distinction. Prose rhythm supports atmosphere but does not vary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Liora's perceptual signature (tracing moth veins, noticing light on stones) is distinct and consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric, with purposeful compression ("the way a shadow lingered after the object casting it was gone"). Some figurative density ("mist curled tighter, the moss drank the light") borders on decorative in a high-pressure beat, but voice remains coherent and the prose reflects the contemplative stance. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled and textured, with purposeful diction ("as if the sky itself were listening") and a perceptual signature filtered through Elias's craft ("metal, like memory, had to be coaxed, not forced"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity at the ending. However, phrasing like "the quiet breath of the aurora" and "a river of sound" occasionally drifts into elevated register that tensions against the focalizer's grounded, artisan perspective, and a few filter verbs ("He had learned," "He had spent months") dull immediacy in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("edges of things," "threads of fate") establishes voice but tilts toward elevated register inconsistent with the visceral bunker setting. The woman's dialogue carries mythic formality that matches tone but lacks subtext or evasion. Filter verbs ("he had learned," "he understood") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance widens at closure when narration summarizes Elias's realization rather than showing his response.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and maintains appropriate distance for the astronomer's scholarly register. Diction is elevated—"empirically ironic," "dusky harmony," "encrypted devotion"—which fits the ancient-mystic frame but borders on over-wrought in peak beats ("liquid silver," "starlight veil"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the astronomer's lines pursue understanding and the figure's responses apply pressure, though both voices share a formal, nearly interchangeable register. Filter verbs ("understood," "followed its gaze") are present but not excessive. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's shift to omniscient observation ("they found only") slightly weakens focalization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV through Elara is stable and controlled. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority ("the storm inside her") alternates with perceptual anchoring ("the sanctuary shifted again"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; "You don't remember me" and "Should I?" carry subtext. Elara's perceptual signature is selective: she notices the pin's jagged teeth as "like the trust she had spent years carefully dismantling," a character-specific filter. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the weight") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature favors poetic compression ("shimmer of twilight frost," "glass mountain"), consistent with a reflective maker of mirrors. Diction elevates slightly (e.g., "metronome," "shards of memories") but reads voice-motivated rather than register drift. No dialogue. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (short declarative beats, imagistic density) are taught early and sustained. One filter-verb cluster ("he felt," "he understood," "he realized") in the final third slightly dulls immediacy but does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Liora; perceptual signature filters setting through her mender's eye (chipped mortar, hairline fracture, faded crimson silk). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—the girl's "endearingly feisty" voice is distinct in rhythm and directness ("My grandmother said you could fix anything with a crack"). Diction remains within Liora's lexicon; purposeful compression in the orchard-vow passage ("turned deciduous, shedding their meaning") elevates without obscuring. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the peach-bite closure, pulling back slightly to frame reflection without losing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a lyric, contemplative register ("whisper of something forgotten," "veneer over something far stranger"). Perceptual signature is curator-specific: she notices artifacts, cataloging details, the orchard's "disquieting hum." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs," "brightened disquiet") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The bath-scene inquiry is purposefully reflective and anchored to sensory cues (warmth, water, starlight), fitting the Accumulative lens, but the phrase "inquire—not with her hands, but with her mind" over-explains the shift rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Elara's perceptual signature (botanical lens, coded observations, reading the unspoken) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext ("You're the one who led me into this maze"). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Diction remains within POV lexicon. Some lyricism ("off-key note in an unheard symphony") elevates without obscuring. Distance control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Elias's perceptual filter (emerald swatch, "unkindled solace," memory layering) is distinct and consistent. Diction—"blissfully aberrant," "narrative threads," "unkindled solace"—maintains elevated literary register appropriate to the Gothic-fantastical mode. Dialogue (two brief exchanges with Liora) carries subtext but lacks naturalism; "To recapture me?" and "Some solace isn't meant to be kindled" read as thematic vehicles rather than spoken urgency. Psychic distance remains close without head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between descriptive sweeps and shorter beats at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a formal, measured voice ("warmly methodical care," "pulsed with quiet certainty") that suits an archivist. Psychic distance is consistent, and perceptual filters reflect her professional lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("translate confusion into clarity") and the voice doesn't modulate under the peak discovery—stress should compress syntax but rhythm stays steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Ryn's perceptions. Perceptual signature is professional (tracing ripple-marks, charting frequencies) and specificity in diction ("bloom of hush," "conjured a thin thread of light") anchors voice. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the bloom encounter, pulling slightly back for the escape. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Prose reflects urgency under pressure ("She had to move quickly"; "She had to leave") without losing texture. The "whisper" of binding words and the stone's "stolen silence" feel voice-consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric yet grounded, with a careful balance of compression and clarity. Diction is consistent with the custodian's reflective isolation: "shard of hush," "beacon-tower custodian," "dust of a dead civilization." No head-hopping; single POV holds cleanly. Perceptual signature is character-specific: he reads star paths, tastes old rain, sees cities in dreams. Purposeful compression in phrases like "as if the world had tilted and they'd slid to new places in the dark" supports the accumulative texture without obscuring causality. Psychic distance is stable; no filter-verb stacks or register drift into diagnostic language.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent and textured: archival diction ("summer-quill," "quantify the unquantifiable"), controlled distance, and perceptual selectivity (ink that "smelled of sun-warmed meadows"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are legible. However, several phrases veer into elevated abstraction that clashes with urgent perception: "the weight of all the things she had yet to live," "a song she was only just beginning to write." Under peak pressure (the third monument's whisper-chorus), the diction remains ornate rather than sharpening with stress.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Liora's craft ("fire that danced, that laughed, that told stories without words"). Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional register drift appears ("filter her awareness through the silence, letting it settle into her skin like dew" is elevated for a wandering designer). Purposeful compression in the opening paragraph ("chanted under her breath, a rhythm older than the fortress itself") is legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; interiority remains character-bound with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices "the way a hermit crab hesitated before choosing a new shell" and approaches mysteries "through tangential paths, circling them like a crab sidling toward a shadow." Diction remains character-particular and purposeful throughout. Psychic distance modulates intentionally—close during the dream-memory, pulling back slightly at the realization. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythmic control is strong; the prose breathes with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Liora's sensory vocabulary: "listening to the flavors of different silences," silence that "tasted like ozone," the doll "intangibly tangible." Her perceptual signature (parsing echoes, thud, breath-hitching vents) is consistent and particularized. The boy's voice is distinct in cadence and ease, contrasting with Liora's hesitant interiority. Diction stays true to her bunker-trained awareness without register drift. The figurative density ("walls pressed in like the ribs of some great slumbering beast") is high but voice-motivated and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elias; focalization is clean with no head-hopping, and his perceptual signature (listening for gaps, monitoring quiet) is distinct. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"dissolve into the hush like sugar in water," "fluidly logical as breathing"—creating textural coherence. The dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven; Elias's lines pursue insight while the woman's responses carry subtext. However, several phrases approach stock lyricism ("threading through the hush like a needle through fabric," "rise from the page like smoke") and the woman's voice in her single extended reply lacks differentiation from the narrative register.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is clean; no head-hopping. The prose carries a slightly elevated register appropriate to a lore keeper but occasionally drifts into stock fantasy phrasing: "liquid stained glass," "inner light," "first light of dawn." Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—scholarly attention to texts, murals, and layered meaning—is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates under pressure ("sallied forward" feels arch in context), and some filter verbs ("felt the weight") dull immediacy. The voice is competent but not distinctive enough to charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; the keeper's perceptual signature (ashen walls, forgotten fires, silver starlight) is consistent and voice-particular. Distance modulates purposefully at the child's arrival. One dialogue exchange ("They said you could teach suffocating to breathe") carries plot but feels more thematic than natural speech. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she had expected") cluster in the backstory paragraphs but do not obscure immediacy at closure. Psychic distance tightens cleanly in the final beat. No head-hopping, and the prose texture supports pressure without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: "virtuously mischievous," the bolt's hum, Mara's riddles processed as maps. Focalization remains stable, and psychic distance tightens effectively during the porthole sequence. The text messages' jagged pixels and the void's "colors that shouldn't exist" feel voice-matched. Minor filter-verb stacks in the opening ("come," "found," "had always been") dull immediacy slightly, but the rhythm modulates well under pressure and diction stays in register.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perceptual signature ("the kind of quiet that hummed with the weight of centuries"). The specter's dialogue is italicized and distinct, avoiding head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("eloquently silent," "sliced through his fatigue," "damning revelation") clashes with high-pressure beats, and the great-uncle's exposition ("They didn't just take our name, they took our voice") reads as on-the-nose theme delivery rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focus on Aldric's perceptions. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("leaves skittering over graves," "shivering bliss"). The woman's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is selective (sword trembling, breath hitching). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Some filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose sustains a distinct texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; distance is consistent and sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (short clauses during discovery, longer reflection in transit). Perceptual signature is clear: Elias reads dust and wear as narrative. The landlady's dialogue ("He kept to himself...") feels natural and goal-driven. One minor slip: "the way lives could be reduced to fragments and still hold so much meaning" edges toward essayistic register but remains tethered to Elias's archival perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and Lira's perceptual signature—selective attention to reflections, ruins, screens—reads character-specific. Diction is controlled with purposeful compression ("liquid fire," "ghost of voices"), though phrases like "the tyranny of indifference" and "hold the line" feel slightly elevated beyond her lived idiom under crisis pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains tight. The rat cameo and Lira's bitter laugh add texture, but the final paragraph's declarative certainty ("And so was she") slightly flattens voice modulation at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering setting and action through Elias's musician's sensibility (reeds, notes as whispers, "polished surface catching…light like a mirror"). Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated: "vested hush," "spectral shards," "bioluminescent moss" cohere as a single perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the playing sequence ("The saxophone's reed trembled under his fingers") and pulling back for the final departure. Rhythm varies naturally without template cadence, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (seed-sorter precision, "edges," "movements") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fleeting note in nature's grand composition," "world where the leaves were not dead but dormant") that reads authorial rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's "whispered that she had become part of the folklore now" is distant summary rather than close internal experience. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "understood") are frequent but voice-motivated enough to remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; focalization anchors consistently to Elias's perceptions. Diction matches his tinkerer's lexicon ("brass gears," "satchel," "hinges groaning"), and the narrative voice modulates effectively from workshop calm to cavern intensity. The robed figure's dialogue ("You've come at last," "their voice like the ticking of a clock") introduces a second speaker, but the exchange is brief and does not test voice distinction across sustained pressure. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the waterfall crossing. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV remains stable; Liora's perceptual signature (alchemical tools, precision over grief) is distinct. Elias's dialogue ("You came") feels natural and sparse, carrying subtext. The prose modulates under pressure—short clauses when she finds the coin, longer cadence in reflection—but several lines ("the world itself had paused to listen," "the foundry's shadows seemed to sigh") slip into elevated register that slightly exceeds Liora's established practical voice. No head-hopping; free indirect control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly to the collector's perspective with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a lyric, elegiac register ("coat patched with memories," "sky bled a hidden sunrise") that fits his ancient, burdened role. Diction remains elevated but consistent; no unmotivated register shifts. Dialogue is spare and purposeful: "You're not supposed to be here" / "I know" conveys recognition and weariness economically. Free indirect style blends his perception with narration smoothly. The woman's voice ("wind through dry reeds") is distinct in timbre though brief. No head-hopping or POV leakage; perceptual signature favors sound and atmosphere over visual catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Elias filters the forest through trauma and mathematical precision. Diction occasionally elevates ("proprioceptively enhanced," "ultraviolet penance") beyond plausible interiority for a torture survivor, creating minor register drift in peak beats. The stranger's dialogue ("their voice like dry leaves") is atmospheric but generic. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance narrows appropriately during the vial-drinking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "between-worlds translator," "eternal instant," "some things are elusively tangible." Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout; no head-hopping. The alchemist's dialogue ("You're not the first to seek it") and the artist's ("Some say...others say") carry subtext and advance plot. Free indirect style is clean when Liora's father's voice intrudes ("Some things are elusively tangible"). No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (dust spirals, cobweb tremors, sediment layers) is distinct and selective. Diction stays within her observant, slightly wry register ("ghosts didn't care about union hours"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climax (short sensory bursts: cold-warm-burning, sawdust smell, laughter). No dialogue appears, so voice is tested solely through narration, which handles compression (decades of hands, years of ceiling-watching) without filter-verb stacking or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries elevated, lyric diction ("no larger than a thimble," "coiled around his wrist") that suits the fantastical register but occasionally drifts into stock phrasing ("breath curling in the air like smoke"). Perceptual filtering is weak—sensory details (frost, glass chimes) are presented as neutral catalog rather than colored by Elias's professional or emotional priorities. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the prose has rhythmic control, but the narrator's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV (Elias) with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (burnished sorrow, reverence for beauty, ritual caution). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("baroque spires twisting into the dark," "air hummed with the weight of time made visible"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit (Liora's "sentiment won't rebuild" vs. Elias's "it might remind us why we should"). Minor slip: "burnished sorrow in his chest aching like an old wound" leans into label-plus-stock-metaphor rather than fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("thin as a reed," "patches of twilight," "tinkersong") carries a consistent lyric-fantasy register. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew without knowing") appear but are voice-motivated, fitting the meditative tone. The stranger's dialogue ("Midnight stole the light") and Elias's interiority share a similar elevated idiom, reducing voice distinction. Psychic distance narrows during the memory jolt, then widens at closure. No purposeful elision or experimental compression; the prose is conventional and legible. The final image ("melody a tinkersong of wonder") feels slightly forced, recycling the prompt term without rhythmic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "stone remembering water," "bruised twilight," "machines stopped." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("his skin prickle") to the lyric remove of "something vast and dormant stirring at last." The grandfather's vocalization—"groan of hinged awakenings"—risks elevated register but is anchored by the narrator's consistent texture. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what Elias can plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a distinct texture ("spirited in the way of those who carve," "always turning, always learning"). POV distance is stable third-limited on Elias. Mara's dialogue ("You've come to reimagine us") and the exposition about timewoven alliances feel slightly elevated and explanatory rather than subtext-driven. The prose modulates with scene pressure (the storm opening is denser, the cavern calmer), but under peak moments—shattered slide, bridge completion—the narration remains observational rather than embodying Elias's urgency or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Liora's focus on patterns, unseen layers) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "as if alive") appear in peak beats but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue to assess. Prose rhythm modulates appropriately across transit and reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV through Elara is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the quiet weight of history," "graveyard of driftwood") that feels authorial rather than Elara's immediate perception under stress. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven (Lila's exposition, Rourke's warning), though Lila's "She wasn't the first. The lagoon's retrocognitively trapped" drops a coined term without POV-appropriate context. Psychic distance tightens during the retrocognitive vision and chase, maintaining momentum. Voice is competent but not strongly character-particular—Elara's perceptual signature (what an archivist notices) could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "the alchemy of the mind," "a civilization distilled into its purest, most potent form—potential." Diction is elevated but consistent with Elias's scholarly lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the bottle experiments, wider for backstory on Hollow's End. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "He didn't know what would come next" in the final beat shifts into uncertain future-facing summary, slightly diluting the immediate closure image. The reflective blocks (Wishwell history, town's ruin) anchor in present stimuli (the bottle, the cove) and maintain voice texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Voice is distinct: "venerable oath scribe," "Book of Unspoken Vows," diction elevated but coherent. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices bark texture, needle tremor, juice weight) but does not shift under pressure. The prose remains even-toned throughout; no modulation from observational to urgent. Elision is minimal and purposeful (we don't see the Archives' full instructions), but the lack of compression or intensity at the realization beat flattens the voice's dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora's perceptual signature is clear: she notices textures ("grain," "friction"), sensory anchors (scent of loam, taste of earth), and the interplay of stillness and force ("furiously tranquil," "storm in stillness"). POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Some diction edges toward elevated abstraction ("vortex inheritance," "unmaking," "beat in two directions at once") that slightly exceeds her established voice, but the register mostly fits her contemplative, heirloom-keeper lens. Psychic distance is controlled and modulates with the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is character-specific ("the way the air hummed, the way the birds fell silent"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with rhythm modulating under pressure (short beats at the crack, longer reflection afterward). No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Minor slips: "credibly curious" is a slightly external label, and the line "Not in the way of scholars…but in the way of someone who…" edges toward explaining rather than showing. Psychic distance is intentional and clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with Elias's perceptual signature evident in his spiritual framing (stars as "offerings," the station "remembering," dust that might hide divinity). Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent, matching the "primal elegance" tone. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") appear but serve the contemplative mode without dulling immediacy. The prose modulates appropriately from the long, meditative opening to the sharper alarm sequence and back to reflective closure. No head-hopping, no dialogue to test, and the internal voice remains character-specific (a man who "sought something softer" than equations).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's tranquil, perceptive stance. Diction is controlled: "tranquilly perceptive," "hollow eyes," "mute eloquence" fits the muted tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—he reads gestures, lips, contextual clues—and the prose rhythm modulates subtly (longer contemplative sentences early, shorter sentences at the box opening). No dialogue; the woman's gesture and flower communicate through action. No head-hopping, filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated ("He understood," "He recognized"). The final image ("lighter") recalibrates the interior texture without rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and Elias's perceptual signature (timekeeper's attention to gears, dust, frayed edges). Diction is controlled, favoring concrete images like "cracked ice" glaze and "embers in the dark." The piece includes minimal dialogue—one dream line—which carries subtext effectively. However, several beats lean on filter verbs ("saw," "understood," "needed") that dull immediacy, and the phrase "he had finally understood" in the closing paragraph tells rather than shows through image. No head-hopping or tense drift, and the free indirect style is mostly clean, but the voice does not modulate sharply under the dream's emotional pressure, missing an opportunity for rhythmic intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third limited, with Mira's perceptual signature clear ("the silence was a living thing," "shattered stained glass"). Diction is poetic and controlled, matching her vocation. However, figurative density is high throughout, and some constructions drift into elevated literary register that risks overtaking the character's urgency ("the burnished hush of the lagoon wrapped around her like a second skin" in a moment of creative breakthrough feels more authorial than felt). No dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elias's perceptual signature (the pulse of earth, the wire's tension, the animals' trust) is consistent and selective. The prose has a meditative, precise texture ("his movements precise, almost meditative"; "his brazen calm unshaken") that matches his character. No head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains controlled. The phrase "brazen calm" reads slightly ornamental but does not disrupt voice. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (close during wire work, slightly wider for the orchard's "whispering secrets").

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady through Elias's lens; distance is controlled, and perceptual signature (academic skepticism, lab memory) remains consistent. Liora's dialogue—"bronze quiet"—fits voice and world. Minor slip: "signal from the void" and "translations" introduce backstory without anchoring it to present stimuli, risking a brief filter-verb stack ("had been," "had scoffed," "had laughed"). Diction stays within register; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in third-close with controlled distance; Elias's perceptual signature is consistent (interpreting jetty creaks, wind voices, bird calls as language). Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated: "papery husks brittle with age," "soil had turned to dust," "sky's emptiness, a vastness so narrow it felt like a wound." Psychic distance modulates appropriately, pulling close for embodied perception and allowing brief omniscient texture ("the wind carried their voices") that reads as his interpretive lens rather than head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elias's perceptual signature (bloodhound instincts, maps of failure) is distinct. Diction is controlled with consistent register ("phonograph needle skipping grooves," "perfume of the world before the fires"). One minor slip: "tinted revelations" as a phrase feels slightly authorial rather than character-particular. Distance modulates well under pressure, and the voice carries a noir-inflected weariness that supports tone. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, strong internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully (close during interior reflection, wider for setting description). Diction is controlled and poetic ("frozen breath against the void," "lazy ribbons") without clashing with the reflective tone. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling") are voice-motivated. The perceptual signature—time as tapestry, stars as alive—is character-specific. Psychic distance occasionally drifts into expository summary ("his motivation had always been simple") that flattens immediacy, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Lirien's perceptual signature shows in tactical observations ("she had miscalculated") and the wry amendment of her mentor's advice ("but do it while running"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in the trade negotiation. The guardian's voice ("its voice the sound of cracking ice") reads distinct. Diction remains consistent to the fantasy register without significant slips.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with a lyric-philosophical register that matches Liora's reflective occupation and the piece's tonal aims. Psychic distance contracts appropriately when she kneels at the chessboard and extends during the historiographic reflection. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in the historian's "You're collecting ghosts" and Liora's "Aren't we all?" Free indirect thought blends cleanly with narration. Perceptual signature is consistent—metaphors of breath, echoes, absence—though under peak pressure the diction remains elevated rather than fragmenting. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric register ("mercury-glass seer," "teeth ache," "fingers like brittle twigs"), though elevated diction occasionally overreaches ("slithered into his skin," "raw material of memory"). Internal thought is clean, with controlled free indirect style. The bookstore owner's single line of dialogue ("You're seeding something") feels oracular and voice-distinct. Under peak stress (descent), compression is acceptable, but the final paragraph's thematic articulation ("home wasn't a place... but a shape") reads as authorial summary rather than Elias's embodied perception, pulling distance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with controlled psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature (fidgeting, chess-tutor precision repurposed to thread-decoding, metaphor-rich observation) is distinct and voice-motivated. The prose modulates effectively: dense, figurative description in calm beats ("distant thunder rumbled, not a storm's fury but the lull of some celestial engine") compresses to direct action in the mirror sequence. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("he saw," "he reached out") appear but remain voice-consistent. One small slip: "the woven hush of the memory was thicker than the village's" is slightly over-written for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira with controlled distance. Diction is elevated and consistent ("perpetual haze," "hollow ache," "chorus of ghosts") but leans into purple prose at peak beats—"forging truth" and "alive" as the climactic feeling are generic rather than character-particular. Dialogue pursues goals (Echo's prodding, Lira's resistance) but lacks subtext; lines like "Friends don't judge either, but you're about to" and "You're not refracting truth. You're forging it" are on-the-nose thematic declarations. Perceptual signature is present (Lira notices the bone towers' ivory curves, the spire's etchings) but does not modulate under pressure—her internal voice remains uniformly literary throughout. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") are acceptable but cluster in reflective beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable and clean. The prose has distinct texture ("iron bones creaking," "spectral fingers," "quilts of half-remembered dreams") that reflects Elias's alchemical lens. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, several filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("wasn't sure," "had come here to conjure," "had to make sense") and the perceptual signature—while consistent—leans toward elevated diction ("pockmarked with centuries of neglect") that occasionally drifts from immediate crisis perception. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; Elias's perceptual signature (painter's eye for color, texture, algae as "slow heartbeats") remains consistent. Free indirect style is clean, diction fits an aging artist ("salt in his beard and regret in his bones"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the lunge, wider during reflection). No dialogue appears. The phrase "as if someone had been here just moments before him" introduces minor ambiguity about who primed the palette, but it does not break POV bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elias's sensory attention and internal conviction. Diction is elevated and poetic ("dawn bled into the sky," "heat wave's dying breath") but consistent within the established lyric register. Maren's brief dialogue carries subtext (scoffing skepticism shifting to awed silence) but lacks distinct idiom; both characters share the narrator's cadence. The prose modulates with the storm's arrival and the vial drop, tightening rhythm at the peak beat. Filter verbs ("felt it," "knew") appear frequently but fit the reflective voice. Distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV held cleanly with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-contemplative register: "the way the moon pulled at the tides even when the tides were gone." Perceptual signature is evident (Elias notices symbols, traces routes, hears distant waves) and remains character-bound. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a navigator-mystic figure. Minor slip: the phrase "He exhaled, his breath fogging in the cold air" uses a small filter-gesture combo that slightly softens immediacy in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and embodied throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices loam, roots, and silence through a forager's lens. Diction stays grounded and specific ("gnarled roots," "slick paths," "mildew and old secrets"). The brief italic telepathy from the eye ("You're afraid") is a deliberate device, not head-hopping, and the return to her shaken interiority maintains distance control. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (dream, burial). No dialogue on the page to evaluate, but internal voice remains distinct and purposeful across pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, anchored to Elias's perceptual signature: "salt-crusted glass," "the sea's endless patience." The borrowed-memory passage introduces minor distance wobble—Elias acquires detailed alpine images (cowbells, absinthe café) without clear transmission mechanism—but the piece signals this as lyric inheritance rather than realistic flashback. Diction remains mostly voice-consistent; "the gaps between what was said and what was left unsaid" is slightly thesis-like but serves closure. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (map-dealer's eye for detail, nostalgia for hidden paths). Diction fits the focalizer's lexicon and modulates appropriately under pressure (breath caught, jolt of realization). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. The psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, melancholic texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy; the prose stays concrete and image-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cage of silk and shadow," "tapestry of twinkling lights," "cathedral of light"), creating a lyric texture. Psychic distance remains close enough to track her pulse and breath. Dialogue is minimal; the mirror woman's lines carry mythic register that fits the scene's tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—many phrases ("wind tugging at her robes like a restless child," "lanterns flickering like dying embers") could belong to any fantasy narrator. Voice modulates little under pressure; the queen's interior rhythm stays uniform from balcony to mirror encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is lyric and image-rich, with a consistent perceptual signature: "molten copper," "dying stars," "polished by time." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but purposeful, carrying subtext ("I needed to know if you were still you"). However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity") that feels writerly rather than character-particular under pressure. The final beat's syntax and rhythm support the charged poise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "*Chronologically confused, eh?*" in Harkin's mouth versus Elias's internal "*I was here. I mattered.*" The perceptual signature (iron-and-pine taste, the hollow in his chest) stays character-particular. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reflection to present fear. The prose rhythm tightens toward the ending without filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Elias's perceptual signature—touch and sound replacing scent—shapes every beat (brass grooves as braille, voice wavering). Dialogue is spare but goal-driven: Clara's "humanize it" and Elias's "Tell me about the last birth" pursue stakes directly. Minor deduction: "trembling at the edges" and "wind through reeds" lean slightly generic for this otherwise precise voice. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the etching beat. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited; focalization stays with Liora throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric register—"saturated hush," "black snow," "warm pulse of something older"—that modulates with emotional beats. Perceptual signature reflects her scholarly lens (forbidden texts, rune mechanics) and grief filter. The prose has rhythmic control and purposeful diction. Minor issue: occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") that could be tightened, and the final paragraph edges toward summary ("scars no longer felt like failures") rather than showing the shift through action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices metaphors, tuning, frequencies). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Clara's line "You let them finish their song" carries thematic weight and subtext. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the ritual and breathing in the final paragraph. Diction remains within Elias's professional and emotional lexicon (exorcism as "tuning a radio," grief as "a river"). Minor slip: the curator's line "Did it work?" feels slightly utilitarian, though it serves to frame Elias's thematic reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present ("dust motes swirled…each particle a syllable of time unspoken") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-organic ("wanderingly exact," "hiccuping…fabric stuttering"). No dialogue. Distance control is consistent. Purposeful compression in the void sequence ("she reached out and began to weave") is legible under an Accumulative lens, but the elision of weaving mechanics feels convenient rather than taught.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-limited POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: Elias notices "razor edges glinting," "the weight of time," hydraulic hiss "like a kettle." Voice texture is consistent—elevated diction ("eminently peculiar," "monstrous thing of water and gears") fits a clock shepherd's idiom. No head-hopping. The countdown interludes ("Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight. Fifty-seven.") function as ritual markers and modulate psychic distance without breaking focalization. Purposeful compression ("Outside, the wind carried...") anchors early. Filter verbs ("He had seen it before") are infrequent and voice-motivated. The prose coheres under pressure, though a few phrases ("something thicker, like the air itself was folding") lean toward stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative voice carries a distinct texture ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions," "mica-pane lanterns") that matches Elara's academic-investigative focus. Perceptual signature is character-specific (filtering details through probability and her father's notebooks). The librarian's dialogue ("Your father used to ask for those too") carries subtext and advances plot. Some filter verbs and expository interiority ("the weight of the revelation pressing against her ribs") are functional but dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "scent so familiar...she no longer noticed it," "melodically haunted." Diction ("metronome for grief," "loop of dead air") is character-particular. The woman's and boy's dialogue fragments carry subtext. Distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider summary of the twelve-year tenure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice holds under pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's archival sensibility ("walnut-ink," "gently thorough," "unraveling of stories"). Perceptual signature is distinct: he notices the locket's edges, the scent of lavender, the rhythm of the sea. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated. One slip: "the covenant regenerated in ways no one expected" and "when context changed" momentarily widen to a community perspective without clear transition, briefly loosening focalization. Internal thought formatting is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—filtering the station through his jocular shield, the weight of rumor-tracking, and the longing he projects onto the moon rock—is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the logistician's dry, gnomic lines ("This isn't a trade. It's a catalysis.") contrast with Elias's forced laugh and raw plea. Filter verbs ("he had come," "he didn't believe," "he cared") are present but not excessive, and the prose modulates appropriately from Elias's nervous energy to the final quiet realization without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Liora's sensory world; perceptual signature is selective (haptic, vibrational, auditory over visual). Diction is elevated and lyric ("coiled around her," "quiet blaze"), fitting the mythic register but occasionally drifting toward stock phrasing ("years, though the stars told her it had only been a night"). No head-hopping. The closing line's rhythm and image ("home in the silence between the notes") elevate the ending. Psychic distance is consistent; no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric-fantasy register with controlled diction ("bruise-colored smear," "watercolors," "ozone and fresh bread"). Distance remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Elias's dialogue is brief and functional, lacking distinct idiom from Liora's interiority. Minor filter-verb reliance ("thought of," "knew") is voice-appropriate. Perceptual signature is selective (the pen's nib, the anomaly's pulse) and character-specific, supporting the celestial-interpreter role.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during gesture, wider during harbor description). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices light-dance and silence-hum, not tourist catalog. Elias's sparse dialogue ("You're mapping silence again") carries distinct idiom and subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Minor filter-verb stack in early paragraphs ("She had always been," "He had been") dulls immediacy slightly but doesn't obscure voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the confrontation. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("You're late" / "Or you were slower" carries subtext). However, "analytically intuitive mind" and "volcanic tenderness" are register intrusions—the former clinical, the latter operatic—that break the established middle register. Diction is mostly consistent, though "embers settling" as a laugh description strains. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific; Elara's noticing (jagged lines, thread unraveling) could belong to any careful observer.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: Elias filters through sound (drumming, frequencies, the universe's breath) and light (starlight, shimmer, glow). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("auric," "entangling tighter") that sits at the edge of his plausible lexicon but remains consistent enough to read as voice rather than intrusion. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the escape. One brief dialogue exchange with Liora in memory carries subtext and feels natural. Under peak stress, syntax compresses without losing internal texture, and the final merger moment maintains the established lyric cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's perceptual signature is consistent: he reads wear on maps, listens to wind pitch changes, counts paces. Diction stays grounded in his maintenance-worker filter. The woman's voice ("Shouts are for the desperate") is distinct and laconic. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. However, the final exchange feels slightly too polished for the urgency of the storm—both characters speak in aphorisms under stress. Minor: "sharp as a blade" is stock.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is tightly controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: Maris's attention to textures (damp wood, smooth stone), her silent gestures, and her visual choreography (angling mirror, tilting shutters) create a coherent voice. The girl's dialogue feels natural and age-specific ("Mama says you're a witch," the tangled hair, the sodden doll), and the narration avoids filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Psychic distance is stable, and the prose reflects Maris's patient, observational stance through selective sensory detail and purposeful compression. The final paragraph's rhythm—metronome canal, the mirror angled skyward—charges the ending without over-explaining, and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices echoes, trembling books, shifting light). Diction stays within his contemplative register without head-hopping. However, some lines drift toward elevated abstraction ("hush where past meets prophecy," "forests of second thoughts") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; interiority is clean but occasionally substitutes metaphor for embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lirien throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric: "the low groan of moored ships," "the scrimshaw grew warm against her skin," "a sigh" when doors open. The mother-figure's dialogue ("Violence became impossible here") carries subtext but the final exchange—"You've always been free, daughter. You only had to stop fighting what you are"—slips into therapeutic register that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lirien notices texture, weight, vibration, and song.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—POV filters all detail through grief-saturated lens ("dark as the earth he had shoveled over his wife's coffin"). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure ("wound reopening" in the dream beat). The dramatic narration of tea-making is purposeful and voice-consistent. Minor register drift: "cultivation" and "private rebellion" read slightly elevated for a man whittling in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register that remains consistent throughout. Diction is purposeful and voice-specific ("palimpsest," "lantern-moth hush"), and perceptual signature (sensory immersion, aesthetic framing) stays coherent. However, the narrative distance occasionally drifts into essayistic declaration ("This was why she had come") and the syntax shows repetitive stems ("She had come," "She had spent," "She closed," "She began," "She knew"). No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The voice is distinctive but not flawless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (touch and memory over hue). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—Liora's "innocently cunning" grin, Mara's "You're communicating with someone"—and each speaker's idiom is distinct (Liora's riddling economy vs. Mara's directness). Diction remains within the artisan register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: tactile, sound-focused, attuned to vibration and light. Diction ("prism-song bell ringer," "texture of connection," "golden shadows") is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext (Dr. Veyra's "You're hearing it too, aren't you?" operates as confirmation rather than exposition). Psychic distance is controlled. The prose modulates naturally between reflection and present sensation without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—his attention filters through craft metaphors ("curtains of intention," "coax beauty from sorrow," "set a pearl into a setting that made it weep") and mourning imagery. The single line of dialogue from the child ("For you") and Liora's spectral voice ("You have to let them wither … only then can they bloom again") both serve purpose, though Liora's line carries thematic weight that risks didacticism. Diction stays within Elias's artisan register, and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the telescope revelation. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm modulates from the opening's languor to the hunt's urgency to the ending's measured calm.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable distance and perceptual signature throughout; Lira's habit of murmuring to herself and confiding in silence roots interiority in consistent voice. Diction is controlled, balancing lyric register ("sedimentary record," "cartomancer") with concrete action. The measuring-tape conceit and card descriptions carry distinct texture. No dialogue appears beyond the texted exchange, which is economical and purposeful. Free-indirect style is clean, and the final beat's rhythm slows appropriately to crystallize the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; Elara's perceptual signature (historian's eye, saffron-veil detail) is consistent. The brief dialogue with Kael reads natural and advances plot. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia," "across the end of innocence") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, and internal voice at the ending ("The archive was purifying her instead") edges toward thesis statement rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent perceptual signature: Elias notices dusk transitions, firefly flickers, shadow pooling. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("bruised from blue to violet," "coiled around his ankle, cold as the river's memory"). No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he realized") appear but fit the reflective voice. Diction remains coherent under pressure, though elevated phrasing ("metamorphose," "sliver of proof") occasionally drifts from immediate perception into narrative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Elias's perception throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the trimming action, stepping back slightly for the workshop description. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "shimmering stillness," "cocoon of quiet," "suspended in time." The brief dialogue to the chameleon feels natural and goal-driven (self-reassurance disguised as address). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices fragility, craft tools, and the workshop's sanctuary quality. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("thought," "felt") are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices plant rustling, traces scars, reads surfaces like text. Diction remains consistent ("the gasp of roots shifting, the groan of branches") and the plant-telepathy dialogue is italicized and voice-distinct. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as he enters the tunnel and chamber. No head-hopping. The prose voice is controlled and the final image lands with rhythmic purpose. Minor slip: "accidentally telepathic with plants" reads slightly meta-explanatory rather than fully dramatized early, but the trait is consistently filtered through his perception thereafter.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature: she notices "hollows between breaths" and "gaps where emotions pooled," filtering the world through her crystal-gazer lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("Not with heat, but with *pressure*"), with purposeful compression in lines like "a hushed thunder in the cramped space." The italicized emphasis (*remembered*, *pressure*, *see*, *shape*) reads as character-particular urgency rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from sensory observation to visionary immersion. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She could *see* it now") are sparse and justified by the psychometry premise. One minor slip: "her voice low, a hushed thunder" externalizes voice in a solo scene where no listener exists, creating a slight POV leak.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate throughout ("aurora-lit," "moonstruck dreamer," "coiled tight like a spring") with consistent lyricism that matches the concept. Under pressure, however, the register does not modulate: the narrator's syntax at climax ("surged, breaking free in a rush of words that spilled from her lips like a river") mirrors the calm opening, flattening urgency. Perceptual signature is generic cosmic-sensitive rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a quiet, myth-tinged texture fitting the post-apocalyptic setting. Perceptual signature is generic: "dimly lit chamber," "vast," "infinity" lack the character-specific bias a freight guard would bring. The disembodied voice's lines feel more like prompt echoes ("through wave functions") than organic dialogue, and Elias's interior remains explanatory rather than driven by distinct idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("the hum of insight," "the wild frontier of his mind"). Perceptual signature is present—copper leaves, rusty soil, frequency in bones—but the philosopher's internal voice lacks distinct idiom or stress-driven compression. The guardian's dialogue ("You've unraveled the first thread") reads slightly expository but remains legible. No head-hopping or tense drift. The prose maintains distance and does not modulate sharply under pressure, which fits the contemplative mode but limits distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is steady (Mira's focus on the punch, violet glow, shoreline sounds). Dialogue carries subtext ("You're not running from something" / "Then you're running *toward* it"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the cove. Free indirect style is clean. Elias and Mira carry distinct idiom in speech. Minor: "her courage locked away in the monotony of routines" slips toward telling, but overall voice is controlled and purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices discoloration, empty bolt holes, off-key humming. The signing exchanges with Madame Veyra are clean and advance goals. Diction suits the gothic-investigative frame—"seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope"—though a few phrases ("curated stillness," "unpardonable silence") edge toward elevated register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the confrontation. Elias's silence (inability to speak) motivates the use of sign language and filters perception through listening rather than vocal response, maintaining voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct register—"a diminutive titan," "the gravity of forgotten gods," "each mote a silent witness"—that modulates with pressure. Diction remains elevated and controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. The prose carries a singular texture in rhythm and word choice. Minor: at peak moments ("she pressed the scroll to her chest, feeling the rune's pulse") the narration tilts toward generic embodiment rather than Liora's specific perceptual signature, and the final smile ("sharp enough to cut") recycles an earlier image without fresh charge, nudging the score below 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual filter (finger-tapping, quickening pulse, breath hitching) is consistent and character-specific. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction remains within her register ("pulse quickening," "coiling unease") and rhythmic modulation supports pressure rises. The AI dialogue is functional but brief; no voice convergence issues. Meets the perceptual-signature and distance-control standards for high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—"light pooled in corners like spilled mercury," "ozone and wildflowers"—and vocabulary stays consistent with Lira's introspective, mythopoetic stance. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening under pressure ("breath hitched"). Free indirect style is clean. The final lines compress diction slightly ("the fire wasn't gone—it just needed someone to reignite it") in a way that feels interior yet declarative, fitting the moment of crystallization. Distinct rhythmic control and no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's perceptual signature—tracing cracks, hearing plant-whispers, filtering exposition through her defiance—remains distinct and purposeful. Psychic distance stays close; no head-hopping. Lina's brief dialogue ("Grandmother, what have you done?") carries goal and subtext. Diction ("gnarled fingers," "coiled around her thoughts like steam") fits the focalizer's embodied attention. Minor rhythm monotony in the backstory paragraphs (repeated "She had" openings) does not obscure voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; Lena's perceptual signature filters through trauma (drone pitch, veil catching light). Diction remains controlled—"knife twist," "funeral pyre"—and embodied interiority (frozen body, shallow breath) replaces filter stacks. Mira's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One small slip: "quietly talented in the way of those who've spent decades…" momentarily shifts into narrator commentary rather than Lena's lens, but recovers quickly and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature—Elias notices charcoal strokes, card edges "chewed by time," the weight of silence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the redesign sequence, pulling back slightly at the wall-closing moment). Rhetorical questions are voice-consistent and filter through his artistic lens. One slip: "He wasn't afraid of disappearing—not yet" reads as convenient authorial foreshadowing rather than organic character thought. The prose rhythm tightens appropriately under pressure (short fragments during the coffin moment, longer syntax when he wakes).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person close remains stable, with Elias's perceptual signature—broken-glass eyes, wind grooves traced by pale fingers—consistent. The phrase "consciously wild" jars as authorial label rather than enacted trait. Dialog from the woman is brief and functional. At the climax, diction holds ("his albino eyes burning with serene anger"), but the serene-anger register never modulates with the stakes; it's asserted at start and end without rhythmic intensification under pressure. Minor voice consistency without standout control.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates purposefully (close in the Mirror beat, wider in the walk to the chamber). Perceptual signature is professional: "vials of voices, petrified emotions." Diction remains consistent—"ozone and old secrets," "the library sighed"—without register drift. No dialogue to assess. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (the Mirror, the letter's weight) and tilts present stance at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature (noticing leaf curl, scent of rain) is distinct and consistent. Voice has texture ("the desert had a way of leaving its mark," "thorns sharp, blooms unyielding") but lapses into elevated register at peaks ("engraved quiet," "wove the only continuity") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Dialogue (two brief exchanges) is functional and carries subtext (the rose as silent argument). No head-hopping. Distance is consistent; filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinctive with controlled poetic compression: "a feral lullaby, a song that soothed and terrified in equal measure." POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature is character-specific (Kael notices sound and vibration over visual detail). The prose modulates effectively from cool observation to mystical intensity. Minor weaknesses: "the fingers of the dead" and "zigzagging across the sky as if fleeing some unseen predator" edge toward stock metaphor, and filter verbs occasionally dampen immediacy ("He had heard the old stories"). No dialogue present to evaluate. Overall, voice is purposeful and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV control is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Elara reads "orbits of regret in the way streetlamps flickered"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("iron gall sharp in the cold air"). The dialogue is minimal (radio exchanges) but carries subtext and goal pursuit. Free indirect style is clean. Some filter verbs ("She had learned," "she knew") are acceptable for the contemplative tone, but "solemn playfulness" in the father's pedagogy is asserted without rhythmic demonstration. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance remains consistent, and diction ("cavernous space," "jury-rigged," "meteor hush") fits a reflective, slightly elevated register appropriate to a man cataloging his own guilt. Psychic distance tightens during the tattooing ("The first mark burned") and widens for backstory without head-hopping. Two small issues: "The laboratory's firmware was haunted, not by ghosts, but by the voices" reads slightly authorial-explanatory rather than Elias's thought, and the final beat's passive phrasing ("The mosquito's wings caught the light") softens immediacy. No dialogue on the page to assess. Sentence rhythm modulates cleanly with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Liora's perceptual signature: she reads shoulders and eyelids, interprets mist moods, and registers the grotto's "living thing" quality. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Dialogue (Maren's two short interjections) is naturalistic and advances plot by challenging Liora's approach. Voice is distinct—slightly elevated, lyric—but consistent. Under peak stress (hearing the grotto breathe, pressing the flake), diction remains coherent without register drift. The prose occasionally leans on filter verbs ("felt it," "watched as") where immediacy could sharpen, but the effect is minor and does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Liora's perceptual signature ("retrocognitively trapped," renaming as spell-casting). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with vivid images ("sky split like broken glass," "tesserae…like fallen stars"). However, several lines drift into elevated register that tensions the embodied present: "aberrant mercy—that was what the old texts called it" and "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" read as thematic summary rather than lived thought under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the register drift in peak beats prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering the garden through Elias's synesthetic perception with distinct texture ("color, every touch left a lingering flavor"). Dialogue is sparse but natural, with Liora's voice ("wind through dry leaves") and her lines carrying subtext (skepticism masking desire). The prose maintains a consistent lyric register without head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the coin-spin beat, tightening to sensory immediacy. Minor issue: Liora's interiority is sometimes asserted rather than shown ("her voice lacked conviction").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third around Mara; perceptual signature is strong (fractals, light, embodied sensation). The prose modulates well under pressure (short bursts when she gasps, longer when reflecting). Eli's single line of dialogue ("You're turning yourself into a canvas") and Mara's reply carry subtext about agency and self-experimentation. Minor distance slip: "the willowglass hope in her chest light as a feather" borrows a cliché simile that doesn't match the precise, technical voice elsewhere. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct (lyric, speculative register with poetic compression: "crumbling into the sea like forgotten teeth"). Psychic distance is controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (sensory emphasis, translator's precision). The entity's dialogue ("You don't have to speak… You only have to carry") is spare and effective, advancing the plot without over-explaining. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the high-pressure beats, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric texture ("groaning under the weight of forgotten things," "wisdom that didn't demand to be heard"). Perceptual signature is controlled: Mira notices tactile detail (brass crown, mother-of-pearl chip) and the warehouse's amber glow. However, some phrases lean ornamental ("secret," "dissolved into the wind") and the phrase "shared wisdom" appears twice in close proximity, risking template repetition. Distance is consistent but the voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register without stress justification.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct texture: elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "silver hush") and lyric syntax ("valley stretched like a wound") suit Elias's reflective, spy-trade lens. Perceptual signature is consistent (codes, scars, engraved surfaces) and filters setting through his survivor priorities. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("felt," "had come") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the knowledge that some things...") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. Compression under peak stress (opening the pillbox, turning the key) maintains texture without obscuring clarity. No dialogue; judgment limited to narration.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices ambient cues, the texture of rope, the way crows fall silent. Diction is controlled—"gnarled as old roots," "spindrift serenity"—and rhythmically varied. A few phrases ("the cousin of ruin," "palimpsest promise") drift slightly elevated for a working ferryman's interior lexicon, but the voice remains coherent. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (craft-trained attention to light, shape, pattern). Diction is controlled and distinct: "skeletal orchard," "veins" of light, "stubborn as weeds." No head-hopping. Psychic distance is close and purposeful; filter verbs ("he suspected," "he understood") are voice-motivated and fit the contemplative register. Rhythm modulates effectively from the opening's measured pacing to the thicker, warmer air at climax. Minor: "Ren was phototropic to kindness, though he would never have put it that way" is author intrusion explaining the metaphor rather than dramatizing it through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Elias; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature (gardening lens, tactile details like dirt beneath nails, the gauge's worn metal) grounds voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Where else would I be?" carries wistful pragmatism). Two slips: "wistfully pragmatic" is a narrator label rather than shown stance, and "quivering hush" appears as overt descriptor rather than filtered perception. The prose modulates well under emotional weight but the lyric register occasionally drifts toward authorial commentary ("the world shifted, just a little") that breaks POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual filter: "atomically reflective," "creatures long extinct—her contemporaries," "heartbeat of the world before." The curator's warning is brief and does not disrupt distance. Diction stays consistent and purposeful, though some phrases ("weight of a thousand lives," "heartbeat of the world") approach elevated register. No head-hopping or unmotivated shifts; the voice coheres under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable; Mira's perceptual signature favors lyric abstraction ("voice the color of wet stone," "whimsy so inevitable it felt like gravity"). Dialogue carries subtext in the keeper's and artist's exchanges, though their idiom converges into oracular phrasing. Free indirect style is clean, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("incantation," "unspooled," "prismatic") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. The final beats maintain narrative stance, and the thrush's song closes with rhythmic purpose. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She wrote," "She folded," "She tucked") in the closing third slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure the ending's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a consistent register (academic-laced, crisis-tinged). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, with Voss's skepticism and Mara's resolve advancing the beat. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the spaces between the stars," "the fabric of the universe") without grounding in Mara's specific perceptual signature. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; the voice is clean but not distinctive under pressure. Mara's internal texture does not compress or sharpen when she activates the signal—the prose remains at the same register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("lattice of iron and glass," "prudently adventurous," "transfix"). Free indirect style is clean ("The key to the spatial mutiny was here, somewhere"). The figure's dialogue carries distinct otherness ("their voice layered with echoes"). Perceptual signature—claustrophobia, the compass's weight "like a promise," recognition of impossible geometries—is character-specific. Minor filter-verb density in the middle ("he almost mistook," "he saw") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during panic, wider during revelation).

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (fogging spectacles, fingers as memory) offers some specificity. Dialogue is functional and carries subtext in the figure's compressed revelations. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("the mist curling around their boots like smoke," "the weapon's curve became part of Liora's story") that feels writerly rather than character-particular. Under peak stress, the voice remains uniform rather than compressing or fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance tightens appropriately under discovery. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices marginalia, reversible lines, the nail's flattened head—details filtered through her scholar's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("spongey dread," "the new sky," "unchartable"). No dialogue appears; internal voice carries specificity without filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean ("The nail had been meant for his coffin, but Elias had used it to repair the boat"). Brief tense consistency slip: "She had come" (past perfect) followed by simple past without clear temporal pivot, but the effect is minor and does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV is stable, with Lena's perceptual signature (musician's ear, "dynamically observant" eye for traces) consistently rendered. Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with moments like "pixelated amnesty" and "luminous with disbelief" showing purposeful compression. The hitchhiker's dialogue ("They flutter...like wings, but heavier") carries subtext and distinction. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; distance remains intimate throughout. Psychic distance and tense are stable, and the prose rhythm modulates naturally with the scene's reflective tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and aptly filtered through Elias's perceptual signature: he notices foreign bills' crinkle, territorial markers, the fox's gaze. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent; the syntax modulates naturally under reflective pressure. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (close on the bills, wider on memory). No dialogue appears. The prose carries a distinct, unhurried texture that matches the dusky, contemplative tone without slipping into generic registry.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, elevated, and lyric without head-hopping; POV remains stable in Elias's interiority. Perceptual signature is present (cosmic imagery, chronicler's diction) and modulates under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The elevated register ("vaulted ceiling," "ancient dance," "silent chorus") fits the tone but occasionally edges toward generic lyricism. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor are taught early and sustained, supporting the accumulative lens without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: Veyra notices cold, roots, branches as living things—consistent with druidic focus. Voice modulates under stress (short sentences during pain: "Pain flared, sharp and bright"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "The Circle had given it to her as a test" is pure exposition. Dialogue at the end ("Next time, I won't ask for help") carries subtext (threat, finality) and advances plot. Minor weakness: filter verbs in reflective passages ("She had watched," "She had known") slightly dull immediacy when a closer present rendering would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("anxious elation," "swirling tapestry of dreams half-remembered"). Perceptual signature is dreamlike but uniform rather than character-specific—similar metaphoric density throughout doesn't modulate with pressure. The single line of dialogue feels generic ("You've come" / "I had to") and doesn't carry subtext or advance plot through indirection. No head-hopping, but the voice leans decorative over urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent access to Liora's interiority. Perceptual signature is character-specific (flame metaphor for idealism, stitching/patching lens for emotional wounds). Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the stranger's dry-leaves voice distinct from Liora's unspoken desperation. Minor filter-verb stacks in the opening ("her fingers brushing," "she had come," "she meant to") slightly dull immediacy, and "dusky resolve" in paragraph six reads as authorial labeling rather than lived perception. Psychic distance remains appropriate, tightening during the bargain scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with Jake's perceptual signature (appraiser's eye for detail, sound engineer's ear) coloring description. The prose modulates rhythmically, tightening in the pit scene ("sharp and bitter," "throat tightened"). Dialogue is sparse but naturalistic; Lena's "confidently uncertain" feels slightly on-the-nose yet fits the tonal register. Filter verbs ("swore he heard," "could've been") are voice-motivated and match Jake's uncertainty. No head-hopping or tense drift; psychic distance contracts appropriately under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "her kindly methodical mind" and "the touching distance of it" veer toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds natural interiority under pressure. Perceptual signature—Elara's focus on patterns, analogies, cuneiform details—is character-specific and sustained. Free indirect style is clean when present ("She had done all she could"). Vocabulary (cuneiform, conduit, fissure) fits a scholar's lexicon. Minor slip: "haunted ambitions" as narratorial phrase lacks clear anchoring in Elara's concrete perception; it hovers between metaphor and summary.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, meditative, with vivid specificity ("salt-laced exhales," "brass toes"). POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (noticing moon phases, smelling brine and ghost-fish) is character-particular. No dialogue on the page; internal voice is consistent. Purposeful compression in the reflective mode is legible and serves the accumulative design. The narrative certainty matches what Elias can know, and the final image maintains the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric and controlled—"prismatic whispers," "reliquary of what could have been"—but the register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that reads slightly above the POV's grounded urgency ("reluctant priestess," "stitching the broken pieces back together"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's "certainty that even abandoned hopes could find their way home" borders on thematic summary rather than dramatized perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during confession, wider at exit) but the prose leans decorative in non-peak beats without tightening rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Lena's perceptual signature clear: she notices texture (porcelain cool, paper edges soft from handling), filters the world through her guilt, and her interior voice carries a literary cadence consistent with a published author. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction choices like "ledger of lost souls" and "cauterize the guilt" fit the character's writerly self-awareness. The accordion's "wheeze" and the ivy's "old fingers remembering a tune" show purposeful figurative language. One friction: the phrase "daringly methodical" appears twice in identical form, once mid-story and once at the close, which reads slightly templated rather than rhythmically varied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance and narrative stance remain stable in third-person limited, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture through word choice ("cyclically reversed," "propagation delays," "liminal hour"). The voice modulates purposefully with pressure—shorter sentences during the book-opening beat, longer during reflection—and perceptual signature is consistent (scholarly attention to symbols, patterns, inscriptions). However, the protagonist's perceptual filter remains generically curious rather than character-particular; a scholar of forgotten languages should notice linguistic detail with more specificity, and the watch's backward-forward motion is described identically in two beats without evolving insight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is distinct—"velvet observatory," "frozen spider silk," "coffee stains … shape of what was to come"—and vocabulary fits her scholar-mystic lens. The father's dialogue ("You always did have a flair for the dramatic") carries subtext. However, "propagate the unraveling" and "fracture" in the plants' telepathy edge toward prompt-echo rather than Elara's idiom, and the final line's tidy summary ("The dream had weighed more") flattens the voice slightly. Low-7 for consistent control with minor register drift at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("silver thread," "fractured dreams," "radiant hush") that fits the meditative voice and grotto setting. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective, filtering the scene through Liora's professional lens ("patterns in the static of existence"). Minor slips: "quiet defiance of holding on" and "heart aching with the beauty" lean toward therapy-speak in peak beats, applying a small deduction. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filter verbs ("she decided," "she understood") are voice-consistent. Perceptual signature is present (moss tending, tree climbing, tactile attention to the hairpin). Psychic distance shifts purposefully during the pool encounter, tightening to sensory immediacy. Diction is controlled and lyric without becoming opaque ("umbral," "vineyard hush"). However, the final paragraph drifts toward expository summary ("She carried something new now—something like peace") that flattens the narrative stance at closure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; Elias's perceptual signature (wind tugging "like an impatient creditor," mirror shard "pressing…like a secret") is consistent and specific. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Veyra's "I didn't kill her" and Elias's "Tell me what you're afraid of" carry subtext and advance the plot. The cloak of doubt's personified whispers risk allegory but stay grounded in Elias's embodied experience. One register slip: "conscience for hire" and "moral auditor" read slightly arch in the opening without full integration into Elias's working-class texture (frayed coat, creditor simile).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited focalization remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close ("afraid of failing, afraid of succeeding") and reflective summary. Perceptual signature is present in scientific framing ("cellular memory," "rings of the pond") and lyric cadence. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sycamore hush," "weave truth carefully") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted, and the grandmother's whispered voice at the end risks convenient narrative closure rather than earned POV texture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent contemplative register. Diction is purposefully elevated ("jagged towers of bone," "the language of the wind and the wings of birds") and matches the meditative voice throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices echoes, patterns, dust—though the lexicon occasionally veers abstract ("invisible roots," "living equation"). No head-hopping, clean focalization, rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters detail through Elias's exhaustion and self-doubt ("threadbare robes," "his magic too weak to warm him"). The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register appropriate to a fantasy mage's perspective, and the mentor's dialogue ("Unstrap your expectations") feels stylized but consistent with the folktale-adjacent tone. Minor issue: the mentor and Elias speak in similar cadences ("You're late" / "I didn't know I was expected"), reducing voice distinction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mist-walking dissolution, tightening at the courtyard encounter and opening again at the flower's blooming.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited stays cleanly with Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at the ladder descent, wider for the sky tableau). Perceptual signature is present: a lamplighter notices light qualities, warped wood, the key's "undeniable" weight. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("You're late." / "For what?"), though the woman's exposition ("You've been lighting the lamps for years, but you've never asked why they still matter") tilts toward thesis statement rather than subtext. Voice remains consistent under pressure, but diction at peak beats ("his pulse quickened," "the words struck him like a bell") leans on stock embodiment. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he noticed") appear frequently but fit the meditative register. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; his perceptual signature (cosmic metaphors, enthusiast's idiom) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon—philosophical but grounded in sensory anchors (cold metal, fogged glass, clatter). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during coin-handling beats, pulling back slightly for cosmological framing. No dialogue present. The piece leans heavily on reflection, but each block anchors to present stimuli (coins in hand, static speakers, stars flickering) and primes his final stance. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "quietly enthusiastic" in the penultimate section reads slightly tell-y rather than fully embodied, though surrounding beats support it.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices cracks, edges, echoes, and inked details with a lyric, elegiac rhythm. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("dust-choked," "skeletal fingers," "hollow bones") with purpose-driven metaphors. Some filter verbs ("He had listened," "He had seen") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-coherent. No dialogue on the page. Under peak pressure (naming the monsters) syntax compresses appropriately ("*Leviathan*...and the first beast bowed") without losing internal texture. Minor drift: "frayed like the frayed edges of his patience" is a visible scaffold echo.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and metaphor-dense throughout with a distinct perceptual signature (light "pooled like spilled ink," silence as unraveling threads). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The prose occasionally leans into elevated register ("brittle devotion," "cosmic imbalance") that edges toward thematic echo but stays within a fabulist idiom. No dialogue, so voice distinction tests do not apply. One brief slip: "earnestly naive enough to believe" reads like authorial assessment rather than Elias's self-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elegiac texture: "the bones of a forgotten song," "the ghost of fermented berries." Psychic distance is controlled; Elias's warden expertise colors perception (levee vigilance, reservoir drawdown mechanics). Register remains coherent, though "precisely humane" appears once as a prompt echo without fully inhabiting Elias's idiom. No dialogue is present. Elision of Mira's fate and the father's relationship is purposeful, anchored in discovery rather than withheld for suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (alchemist's lens on equations, vials, formations) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the pulse of something greater than reason," "melody that needed no translation") that reads slightly ornamental rather than voice-specific under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the crystal moment. No dialogue to assess. The prose reflects Liora's mind adequately but lacks a rhythmic or syntactic signature that heightens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable psychic distance, and distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices veins as Braille, clouds as slow-motion storm, lights as dying stars—pattern-seeking lens remains consistent. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in "Trust had been the first casualty" fits voice. Filter verbs ("wondered," "had to move") are sparse and voice-motivated. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiom (midnight pattern seeker, attentively inventive) without register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short fragments at the snap: "It held"). The "soundless echo" tone recurs but feels more decorative than integrated into rhythm or perception under stress. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Veyra's economy ("Then fight") and Kael's interior questions carry distinct rhythms. The free indirect thought ("*Why am I here?*") integrates cleanly. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during combat, narrowing to immediate sensation. One minor slip: "History is rewriting itself" in Veyra's speech reads slightly elevated for the moment's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Elias. Distance is stable; perceptual signature (conductor's ear, imagining the household) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("macerated into silence," "mournfully eager") that feels slightly imposed over lived-in voice. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not applicable. Free indirect access to Elias's breath hitching and trembling hands works cleanly. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the closure beat. Minor filter-verb presence ("he had once led," "he imagined") doesn't obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent lyric-mythic register. Diction ("skeletal trees clawing," "pages turning whispered") is purposeful and voice-specific. The guardian's dialogue ("voice like paper tearing") and Mara's spare responses maintain tonal coherence. Minor slip: some elevated phrasing ("boundaries of light," "interiorizing exteriors") risks register drift, but the internal texture holds under pressure and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress ("He didn't flinch"). Voice carries a controlled, slightly elevated register that matches an alchemist's obsessive focus. Two slips: "stoically sensitive" is told rather than shown in action, and "the phrase slithered into his mind like a serpent" shifts into poetic commentary rather than staying in Elias's idiom. Perceptual signature is consistent (he notices metal, fire, jagged edges).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, third-person close, remains stable. Diction is distinct and controlled: "serenely electric," "shard of hush," "the universe remembering itself" create a specific perceptual signature. The voice stays consistent through turns, modulating from concrete action (adjusting dials) to lyric abstraction ("the silence between the signals") without jarring register shifts. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose under peak stress ("the tower trembled, its rusted bolts screaming") compresses effectively while maintaining internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("threads in a loom," "tide, pulling in all directions"), though some phrases lean toward generic lyricism ("the light that slipped through the cracks"). Veyra's single line of dialogue reads natural and goal-driven. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("resiliently positive, a permanent transient") shifts into authorial voice rather than staying within Elias's embodied experience. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (fever dreams blurring with reality, focus on impossible geometries) is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays literary without register drift. However, interior voice leans on stock phrasings: "strange calm," "the walls themselves were breathing." Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("he realized," "he felt") without embodied specificity. Psychic distance holds but doesn't modulate purposefully under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lirien throughout; no head-hopping. Focalization is controlled, though perceptual signature remains generic in stress moments—"her heart swelling with somber marvel" tells emotional state rather than filtering perception through her navigation-trained lens. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Tael's voice does not distinguish from Lirien's narratorial diction. Psychic distance holds steady, and there are no filter-verb stacks or tense breaks. The prose lacks a strong rhythmic or lexical signature specific to this character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lena throughout, and perceptual detail is filtered through her professional lens (tracking pulses, coaxing meaning from static). Dialogue between Lena and Elias carries subtext and advances the stakes cleanly. The prose has a distinct, almost noir-tinged texture with controlled rhythm: "The atrium twisted around her, the walls bleeding into the past." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the focus. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("the kind of curiosity that had gotten her into this mess") but remains legible within the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV with tight focalization through Elias; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (fear, technical observation, mystical awe). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching the atmospheric stakes ("syrupy," "gold absorbed into the floor like blood into sand"). No head-hopping. The narrative withholds the full mechanics of the phase transition until Elias discovers them, which reads as purposeful elision that charges the discovery. Minor texture note: some figurative constructions ("stars swallowed by dawn") are striking but edge toward stock lyricism in the final beat, slightly diluting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focused on Elias's perceptual signature: the way he counts heartbeats, handles the shard, measures his failures. Distance is well-controlled, with brief psychic closeness during interiority ("though of what, he wasn't sure") and appropriate withdrawal during the ghost encounter. The ghost's dialogue carries distinct texture through ink-pattern mechanics and static-voice quality. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from the opening's lyric density to the spare final exchange. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance is consistent and apt. Diction is controlled ("copper-veined storyteller," "texture given voice") and character-specific, though occasionally elevated ("quietly articulate," "mirrored the patterns of the birds") in ways that drift slightly from mid-crisis urgency. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("believed," "realized") are acceptable and voice-motivated. The perceptual signature (listening for rhythm, tracing ridges) is selective and distinct. No head-hopping or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, with Elias's perceptual signature—"shadows were chasing him back," the arrowhead "too sharp…as if made yesterday"—establishing voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Maren's "You feel it, don't you?" and Elias's demand "Tell me about the phone" carry subtext and goal pursuit. The closing interiority ("He smiled, bitter and bright") maintains internal coherence under pressure. Minor register drift: "gravitationally playful" and "harmony untamed" read slightly elevated for the POV's established diction, though they remain within bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; distance is consistent and close. Diction is controlled and lyric without becoming precious ("the air hum like a half-remembered lullaby," "towers of rusted metal, streets paved with broken glass"). Dialogue is minimal and natural ("You're real" / "So are you"). Perceptual signature is present—Liora notices rhythm, vibration, and sound above all else—and the prose rhythm accelerates during the flight sequence. One minor slip: "resonantly soft" appears twice as a descriptor for her music, the second time feeling decorative rather than voice-motivated, and the narration occasionally drifts into elevated phrasing ("the gap between knowing and understanding had always been her prison") that reads slightly above the immediacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Jace. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("liminal space," "mechanical shadows," "silent protest against the erasure of names") with a consistent melancholic register, though some phrases ("the illusion of permanence," "the world was rigged but playing anyway") drift toward abstract idiom. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's terseness contrasts with Jace's reflective silence, though her voice could be more distinct. Internal voice modulates under pressure (final lines tighten), and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Jace notices weight, decay, absences) but could be more character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-limited POV is stable; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the song and carousel activation. Diction is mostly character-consistent, though occasional elevated phrases ("misting hush," "triumphant") read slightly imposed over Elias's carpenter voice. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature (wood grain, sawdust, carved eyes) is distinct and grounds the focalization. Filter verbs ("felt the urge," "closed his eyes") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; his perceptual signature (wire-rimmed glasses, "dust motes," "analog memories") is distinct and consistent. The woman's two brief lines of dialogue at the end feel earned and purposeful. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (close interiority → outward description → close again at closure). One slip: "Elias realized then that she had been searching too" tells the realization rather than showing it through gesture or implication, slightly flattening the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured ("sea breathed in rhythms older than memory," "salt spray," "hush of improbable beginnings"), with diction that reflects Elias's contemplative stance. POV distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The brief dialogue at the end feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (the woman's "You found me" versus his correction). Perceptual signature is present (he notices light, color, the palette's hum) and remains character-specific. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the photography attempts. Reaches upper-7s on control and distinctness; no slips obscure clarity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"the air thickened," "shadows deepening"—without character-specific filtering. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("hush of cosmic possibility," "coiled like smoke") that reads writerly rather than locksmith-focalized. The single line of dialogue ("Tell it") is purposeful and lean. Voice remains consistent but lacks a distinctive syntactic or lexical texture that would anchor the focalizer's particular way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Elias; distance is stable and psychic closeness increases under pressure ("his vision swimming," "jolt"). Diction is controlled: "chronically curious," "black hole, swallowing every detail," "resonant chord" fit an older researcher's lexicon without register drift. Perceptual signature is evident—Elias notices patterns (constellations, fairy ring circumference) in ways that reflect his folklorist habits. Purposeful compression in the memory-surge paragraph ("not in images, but in sensations") maintains clarity. The single line of dialogue from Liora ("You took too long") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through implication. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess mars the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: the library as "cracked leather and old rain," her attention to fractured reflections, the scent of ink. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven; Mira's "Why do you walk like that?" and Elara's deflection reveal subtext cleanly. Diction remains consistent with the focalizer's introspective, slightly archaic register. Minor slip: "the hush of an empty playground swing drifting in the breeze seeped through the cracks" strains syntax slightly, and "combative tenderness" as a direct label in interiority risks telling what earlier embodiment had already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Maren with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in her attention to bark texture, sap, and the song learned from trees, though her way of noticing feels more archetypal-wise-woman than idiosyncratically specific. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("silver thread woven through the hush," "cathedral of gold and crimson"), but under peak pressure (the ground trembles, echoes appear) the prose maintains the same elevated tone without compression or shift. Filter verbs appear sparingly and are voice-motivated. No dialogue is present. The narrative certainty about the travelers and their upside-down-tree origin reads as mythic rather than uncertain, which fits the fabulist mode but softens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance throughout with Elias's restorer's eye shaping perception (cracked spectacles mended with wax and wire, tapestry needle details, knot-tying memory). Diction remains consistent and texture-specific ("interlaced hush," "grounded," threads that "drink the light"). The Fisher King's dialogue ("his voice like gravel under tide") carries distinct physicality though brief. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tightens during the knot sequence, opens slightly for the dream-secret reveal. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's observational lens: "methodically curious," "the way ink bled at the folds," "interpret silence with empathy." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent. However, some lines tilt toward elevated register ("dissolution into blank parchment," "swallowed by the mist") that edges past a framer's idiom under stress, and psychic distance occasionally widens without clear purpose. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable. Voice carries a melancholic, lightly lyrical texture ("silt like ash from a forgotten fire," "edges dissolving like ink in water") that fits Elias's scholarly remove. Perceptual signature is selective: he parses equations, recognizes Howland Island without checking. Diction is controlled and purposeful. Minor convergence: the ghost's voice ("crackle of an old radio") and Elias's narration both lean toward poetic register in the encounter, briefly blurring distance. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, anchored in Elias's perceptions (the mist's hum, the graffiti's glow, the ghost's shimmer). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the graffiti discovery, pulling back slightly for the storm's arrival. Diction is consistent and textured ("the silence here was different: it hummed"), and the prose reflects Elias's balladeer sensibility without overreach. The ghost's single line of dialogue ("Thank you") is brief and tonally fitting. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear—Elias notices sound, texture, and pattern—and the rhythm accelerates subtly as the ghost solidifies, then breathes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout; Lira's perceptual filter (noticing the cook's shaking hands, the captain's false laughter) establishes her warmly inquisitive nature. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—the captain's lines carry subtext and avoid exposition. However, several phrases drift into elevated register inconsistent with a servant's interior voice: "shrine to flight," "jagged patterns," "sacred," "indifferent to the weight of these revelations." The prose occasionally explains rather than trusts dramatization ("This diary, though, felt different. It wasn't just another puzzle; it was a promise.").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during telescope adjustments, farther during reflection. Diction is elevated and lyric ("sky bled into twilight," "quietly explosive") but stays consistent; no register breaks. Perceptual signature is strong: Elias notices clouds by emotional taxonomy. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("he decided," "he understood") appear but fit the reflective register. The final paragraph's certainty ("He understood then what he had to do") tells rather than shows the realization, flattening a peak beat. Purposeful compression in the opening (cloud categories as emotional archive) is effective and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent focalization through Liora's perceptual signature: "the tilt of their shoulders, the rhythm of their steps," negative space as portrait subject. Diction matches her artistic lens ("fleeting shadow of a smile," "fractally precise"). However, several lines drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "the hush before a storm, the pause before a breath" reads more writerly than felt. Free indirect style is mostly clean; no head-hopping. Elision of her journey to the library is efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout. Elias's perceptual signature—tracing fingers over charts, noting scratches, copying patterns—is consistent and specific. Diction remains character-appropriate; no register lurches. Orlan's dialogue ("You've been diligently curious, boy") carries distinct idiom and status dynamics. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose texture supports the antiquarian setting without slipping into pastiche. Minor: some filter verbs ("saw it," "realized then") are acceptable but slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright," "metallic whispers"). Diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("the rhythm of repair," "bridge between what had been and what could be") that flattens immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular—Elias notices in generalized poetic terms rather than locksmith-specific idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue to judge. The prose serves atmosphere well but lacks the specificity that would anchor voice in Elias's unique lens under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person omniscient POV is stable, tracking Liora's perspective and occasionally widening to the villagers. Psychic distance is controlled, with no mid-paragraph head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; phrases like "a riot of color" and "a cloud of iridescent wings" read as generic lyricism rather than character-particular filtering. Diction remains clean but does not modulate under pressure to reflect urgency or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is present (decades of study, trembling not from cold). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at closure (eyes closed, breath slow). Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("vouchsafed," "bruised awe") in a way that reads more literary than character-specific, but remains legible. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to judge. The prose as character test is met softly: syntax reflects a contemplative, worn mind. Under peak stress (the hum, the glass shivering), compression works without obscuring interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV stays tight to Mira's perception; psychic distance modulates effectively (close during the man's arrival, slightly withdrawn in the final image). Voice carries distinct texture: "Her breath a cloud in the cold air," "rough as bark," "heavy and unyielding" ground the narration in Mira's embodied experience. The man's single line of dialogue ("Help me") and Mira's response ("Follow the nuts") are spare, goal-driven, and carry subtext—she refuses rescue, offers only a clue. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices practical details (shears, blueprint measurements, bird patrols) filtered through her curse-bound role.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (chemist noticing molecular parallels in foam) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled, with purposeful elevation ("symphony of fluid motion") that fits reflective mode. Free indirect style is clean. However, register drifts slightly elevated in the final third ("letting the grief loosen its grip"), and some interiority over-explains what images already convey ("She had come here to atone" unpacks too tidily in paragraph one).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited holds clean focalization on Elias. Diction is lyric and consistent ("prismatic dust," "dandelion fluff"), but elevated register crowds the prose in every beat without pattern-teaching, trending toward overwriting (−0.3). Dialogue carries subtext ("You don't know either, do you?") but the woman's lines are interchangeable with Elias's interior idiom. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is poetic but uniform across pressure states.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization through Maren is stable; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—tasting rain's memory, analyzing tidal patterns, sandpapering metaphor—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue ("You can't stay here" / "It's the only place that remembers her") is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Distance control is clean. However, "sturdy brittle" (used twice, once as narrative descriptor and once as dialogue tag echo) reads as authorial rather than Maren's interior idiom, and the phrase "subsume" in dialogue feels register-elevated for the scene's intimacy. Free indirect style is used effectively ("She'd learned long ago..."), and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor voice convergence: both Maren and the narrator use metaphoric diction at similar density, slightly flattening distinction between thought and narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (adjusting scores, arranging choral pieces) is character-specific. The prose texture is clean and purposeful. However, dialogue at the tower gathering ("we don't just tell time—we make it") reads writerly rather than spoken, and the multilingual switching is asserted, not demonstrated through distinct idiom. The line "switching between languages as naturally as breathing" tells the facility rather than showing varied syntax or lexicon on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is poetic and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie") and purposeful compression in the mirror-vision beat. However, several phrases feel writerly rather than character-bound: "entangled memories clung to the mirror like static," "synaptic plasticity, though not in the way neuroscientists understood it," and "chaotically precise" read as narrative glosses rather than Lena's lived idiom. The final paragraph's self-definition ("She wasn't an archeologist anymore, not really. She was something else—") pulls the reader out of immediacy into meta-commentary. No head-hopping, and the focalization remains stable, but the register occasionally elevates beyond what the scene's pressure would warrant.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—archival and fragment-focused—but diction drifts into elevated register ("clandestinely luminous," "prism-minded," "latent blaze") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose modulates with scene intensity (shorter clauses when symbols shift). Elision is purposeful: the hour's mechanics are sketched, not explained. No dialogue to evaluate. Voice is lyrical and competent but lacks sharp idiom that distinguishes Elara's mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: "silence so deep it felt like a living thing," "the ghost of [sound]." Focalization remains stable in Elias's perceptual signature (symphonically attuned, tactile). Diction occasionally elevates ("symphonically minded mind," "hedgehog uncurls" as time marker) in a way that feels slightly ornamental rather than necessity-driven, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate; internal rhythm modulates appropriately with action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is controlled and consistent, with elevated diction ("bled into," "skittering across stone") that fits the contemplative register. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully between observation and reflection. Dialogue, though sparse, carries subtext ("Not many recognize that") and advances the partnership without exposition. Lysara's speech and Elias's perceptual signature (correlating stars, tracing the stone) are distinct enough to avoid convergence, and the prose rhythm modulates with the ritual hum sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elias's perceptual bias toward sound and texture. His interior voice—"listening not with his ears, but with his hands"—is specific and consistent. Liora's dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("You always did have a knack for hearing what others couldn't"). Psychic distance is controlled; the narrative does not leak into Liora's interiority. Diction is apt throughout, blending technical (oscillator, coil) with lyric (lattice of stars, hush as shade). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the voice modulates cleanly with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable throughout; Mira's perceptual signature (olfactory sensitivity, "nose twitching," scent as story) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue between Mira and Nara is natural and goal-driven ("You're playing with fire" / "I'm playing with life"), carrying subtext and advancing the confrontation cleanly. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("the turning of the tide's thought," "wildflower hush") that remains voice-motivated and legible. Minor register elevation ("olfactorily sensitive," "undercurrent of wisdom") fits the herbalist's intellectual framing without jarring. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks detract from clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focalized through Lira's professional lens—her familiarity with the arches, her recognition of accelerant growth, her tactile attention to harness leather and glove cracks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the kneeling revelation, pulling back slightly for the final image. Diction is consistent and vivid ("violet haze," "whirling silence," "dandelion seeds") without register drift. The prose has a distinct lyric texture that matches the tone, and filter verbs are minimal. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The perceptual signature is clear and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is controlled and atmospheric, with consistent third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices wind patterns, vibrations, and structural anomalies through an engineer's lens. Diction remains character-appropriate (cranes, diesel, manifest, thermal scanner). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the chase. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The piece narrowly misses higher bands because some lines ("Not literally, of course, but something was using them") break immersion with over-explanation, and the final paragraph's exposition ("those who couldn't keep up were left behind") dilutes the image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Eira; her perceptual signature (sound as color) is consistent and character-specific. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("the ice cavern hummed with a quiet so deep it felt like a living thing"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she thought") are present but voice-motivated; psychic distance is steady. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("synesthetically blessed," "oscillating repose" as applied tone) but remains largely within an artisan-narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric-descriptive texture through "sliver of captured sun," "twisted light and shifting shadows," "woven from shadow and light." Perceptual signature is present in the attention to sound (silence, hum, note) and tactile warmth. However, the vocabulary occasionally drifts into elevated register ("avalanchingly," "weave of reality") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The figure's dialogue is functional but lacks distinct idiom; "It is not meant to seal... it is meant to weave" reads as thematic clarification rather than voiced speech.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: ink "that smelled of old parchment and copper," equations "like a predator's grin," fragment hum "like a choir tuning itself in a language without vowels." The borrowed-personality device creates purposeful register shifts (poet's smoke-drift metaphor, mathematician's dry precision), but those shifts are framed as external voices rather than Elias's own psychic distance modulation, which holds voice coherence. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with the woman); her lines feel functional but lack distinct idiom. The prose texture is lyric and compressed, but some figurative density risks decorative drift: "stars being unremembered," "joy's velocity," "topaz walls pulsed with light" cluster without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: the courier notices auroras painting rocks "in hues no painter could replicate" and wind carrying "voices from places she'd never been." Dialogue with the stranger feels purposeful and advances revelation. However, elevated diction ("iridescent veins," "sympathetically," "marrow of her bones") occasionally drifts from the courier's established voice, and the stranger's lines ("A threshold. Your mentor crossed it. Now it's your turn.") lean expository. Psychic distance control is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Close third-person focalization is stable and clean; perceptual signature is consistent (mystic lens, tactile engagement, attention to vibrations). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout, maintaining an elevated register appropriate to Elias's character. The mother's dialogue ("See how light bends?") feels natural and carries thematic weight without exposition. Psychic distance modulates smoothly from close interiority to memory without head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the man's wife is not explained, leaving productive ambiguity. No filter-verb stacks or voice leakage under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer. Distance is consistent, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("the hush of time's unraveling tapestry") that feels external to a character who has lived in isolation for thirty years. Perceptual signature is present but uniform—her way of noticing is poetic across all beats, with little modulation under stress. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. Purposeful compression ("She followed the puzzle's edges") serves momentum but flattens causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout, filtered through Elias's craft-oriented perception. Diction is controlled with occasional lyric elevation ("azure defiance," "drink in light") that fits the tone without breaking register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider scene framing. Minor slip: the phrase "bartered awakening" in exposition feels like a meta-concept rather than Elias's natural vocabulary. No dialogue present; voice remains singular and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is distinct—sensory mapping idiom, breath syncing with shard hum, scanner jargon—and diction stays consistent under pressure. Dialogue between the two Kaels is sparse but functional ("You're late" / "Or early"), carrying subtext about their shared knowledge. The prose modulates with intensity (short beats during the gate activation), and the internal texture holds without filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the peak moment, though the withheld final thought ("Kael made his decision") borders on coyness rather than controlled elision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct maritime texture: "rhythm of ropes," "weathered dock," "salt and tide." Perceptual signature is strong—Elias notices soot, cold, the hum of ghost light. The prose modulates from terse action to reflective rhythm without register clash. The final turn to summary ("he understood then") slightly weakens distance control, but the voice remains coherent and the elision (who rearranged the stones) feels purposeful rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (laughing herald, light-as-loom metaphor). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent. Minor slips: "not quite memories, not quite dreams" and "caught the edges of what might be" edge toward stock phrasing, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("architect," "promise") slightly exceeds the established texture without obvious voice motivation, though the effect remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; the dye master's perceptual signature (sharp eyes, tracing patterns, watching sun trails) is consistent. Dialogue between dye master and traveler carries subtext and advances knowledge ("You're trying to illuminate something"). The prose maintains a lyric register with controlled diction ("caution... that was also an invitation," "iridescent and quietly explosive"). Slight register drift into abstract philosophizing ("quiet restlessness," "quietly explosive") feels voice-motivated rather than jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited. Diction ("like brittle twigs," "roots unfurling," "spider's legs") is purposeful and sensory. Perceptual signature shows Elias noticing structural details (chalk, crevices, gear brightness) appropriate to his role. Psychic distance tightens during the moonlight healing and balcony scene. Some phrasing tilts ornamental ("the slow accumulation of sorrow…silence between heartbeats") but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (greenhouse as "living thing," fruit "like liquid gold"). The keeper's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("wind through dry leaves") and avoids modern register. However, several filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("felt," "seemed") and the closing paragraph's meta-commentary ("The work was not done—it never would be") shifts into an omniscient summary voice that undercuts Elara's focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's perceptual signature: "keenly empathetic," "quiet devotion," "enlarged tranquility." Diction is controlled and purposeful—"gardener nurturing rare blooms," "origami"—though "enlarged tranquility" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly over-elevated for the moment's urgency. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from contemplation to decision. No dialogue is present, so voice distinction doesn't apply. The prose texture is distinct but occasionally tips toward poetic ornamentation ("the clock's chime resonating through the library like a sigh") that risks slowing the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: he catalogs slippages and gaps. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with register matching an observant, reflective character. The woman's dialogue is economical and goal-driven, though her voice lacks strong idiom to distinguish from Elias's internal register. Filter verbs ("he thought," "she said") are minimal and conventional. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the planting beat. No artifice or template phrasing in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct, cool formality that matches Elias's meticulous nature. Psychic distance is controlled, and the "quartz hush" and other diction choices establish a consistent atmospheric voice. A few phrases ("gently meticulous," "spectral glow") edge toward stock lyricism, but the overall texture is coherent and the narrative certainty matches what Elias can plausibly know.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (smuggler's daughter filters the market through danger and betrayal). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Gentlemen, I believe you've both been misled"); the men's speech carries subtext (knife-wielder's "This ain't your business, girl" conveys dismissal and threat). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the climax. Minor slip: "Remember who you are" in italics feels slightly over-signaled, and the victim's line "You're Elias's girl" is convenient recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; her perceptual signature (skeptic who dismisses the unexamined, taste-sensing, UV glow) is character-specific. Dialogue between Elara and the storm-man carries subtext (his certainty vs. her wariness) and advances plot. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she wondered," "she thought") and one expository block about the compass's inheritance slightly dull immediacy, but voice remains controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("slithered through the cracks," "laughter poured out like honey"). Interiority is concrete and embodied. However, filter verbs ("he knew then," "he knew that door") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy slightly. Diction remains within the artist's plausible register, and the perceptual signature (charcoal-stained hands, violet shadows) is consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent distance. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the oasis's final gift," "the weight of the moment") that reads slightly generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so character voice distinction cannot be tested. The prose maintains clarity but lacks a strong perceptual signature—Liora's noticing feels authorial rather than selective and biased.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance is consistent, perceptual signature clear ("he only knew that the colors were fading"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("The bluff hummed"). Psychic distance shifts intentionally during reflective moments. However, some phrasing trends toward elevated lyricism that feels authored rather than character-particular ("the hues of wonder preserved in frozen water"), and the lack of dialogue removes one test of voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Eli; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—static as sensory metaphor, ghost memories, circuits humming—and diction stays within his android-yet-nostalgic lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close when he screams, wide when the dome groans. The prose rhythm accelerates during the burn sequence. Elision of backstory (the voice, the hand, the ozone scent) is purposeful and anchored to present static surges. No dialogue present; not applicable. Minor repetition: "static" appears frequently but remains voice-motivated and thematic rather than template churn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Elara is stable throughout, with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is evident: "she *listened*, not just with her ears, but with the part of her that had learned to hear the unspoken." Dialogue from Mrs. Hargrove and Mr. Chen carries natural idiom and regional texture. However, Elara's internal voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("the slow unraveling of that community") that reads writerly rather than character-specific. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices vibrations, weight, temperature (lab coat "still warm"), and patterns. Diction is controlled and lyric ("a language of chance," "the ocean's patience"). Free indirect interior avoids filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when describing Kael's dance. Minor slip: "she realized" appears twice in consecutive paragraphs (dice as cipher, journal coordinates), a faint template echo. No dialogue present to evaluate. Overall voice is coherent and purposeful under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and voice-particular. Diction (gleaming silence, pockets of gravity, ozone and conch shell) is selective and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature: Marlowe notices ritual (lanterns, coffee grounds), grief artifacts (wildflowers, journal), and physical pull (gravity, whale's song). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates from reflective (opening ritual) to urgent (chamber scene). Free indirect style is clean. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, though a few lines lean slightly ornamental ("scattered stars") without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds, but perceptual signature is generic—"the world held its breath" and "smoothed hush" could belong to any focalizer. Diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "cartographer of the unseen") that reads authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable but lacks the rhythmic modulation or concrete sensory filter that would anchor voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—tracing embroidered constellations, noting Mira's "interrogation" style—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, especially Mira's gentle persistence and the recognition scene. The phrase "patiently nimble" applied to Mira's voice is a minor register bump but serves thematic purpose. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening at the seal reveal and softening at the reflective close.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with distinct perceptual signature (the velvet garden absorbing sound, breath and wave-lap, shimmer solidifying "like frost on glass"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though phrases like "charmed skeptic" and "tragically radiant" feel slightly imposed rather than organic to Elias's voice. Dialogue—Liora's "I'm not trapped...I'm *archived*" and "Then let's go"—is concise and advances plot, though brief. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the narrative distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout. Diction is mostly controlled, though "poisoned honey," "cracking ice," and "shifting hues of violet and silver" approach stock lyricism. Vey's dialogue ("Truth is what I say it is") and Lian's replies carry distinct goals (evasion vs. assertion) with subtext. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice. The prose texture is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond Lian's exhausted, debt-worn interior (e.g., "calibrated, a necessary betrayal" reads more essayistic than immediate perception under pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in third-limited; perceptual signature is present ("richly perceptive senses," "vibration," "impressions"). Veyan's dialogue ("reed-blown melancholy") carries distinct idiom. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she saw," "she understood") cluster during key beats, dulling immediacy slightly. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose maintains its established register through the end without head-hopping or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-gothic texture ("borrowed starlight," "thieves," "truth woven carefully into her bones") that fits the shrine-and-ice milieu. However, several phrases trend toward purple: "weaves truth carefully, never rushing" interrupts narrative with meta-commentary, and "salvager of echoes" reads as self-conscious branding. The dialogue in the final exchange is economical and carries subtext, but the narration occasionally tells interiority ("Mara realized") rather than embodying perception. Perceptual signature is present but not distinct enough to enter high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ren; perceptual signature (noticing moon-paths, net symmetry) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is natural and carries subtext—"You're late" when he hadn't expected her, Mei's "I thought you'd never ask"—and the two voices are distinct enough (Ren reflective, Mei direct). The prose rhythm modulates well, tightening at Mei's arrival. Minor slip: "scintillatingly somber" in paragraph three feels like authorial flourish rather than Ren's diction, a brief register mismatch in an otherwise controlled voice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("sickly moonlight," "confetti"). The stranger's dialogue carries some subtext ("I came to see if you'd *understand*") but pivots too cleanly to exposition. Elias's perceptual signature—sharply observant—is asserted in the prompt but doesn't consistently filter sensory selection; the orchard description reads generic rather than filtered through his investigative lens. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he realized") appear but don't dull immediacy significantly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds, perceptual signature ("his heart a storm of envy and longing") is consistent, and the diction ("stormlit," "lyrically prophetic") attempts elevation. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats: "watched," "heard," "saw," "felt" appear frequently without clear voice motivation, dulling immediacy (−0.3). Kael's one line of dialogue ("Behold! The dawn is coming!") and Elias's spoken turn lack subtext or character-specific rhythm; both sound generically declamatory. The piece avoids head-hopping and tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; perceptual signature (salt, echoes, light through hollowness) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Elias and the girl feels natural and goal-driven, with Elias's evasion ("I'm translating") carrying subtext. Diction matches his poetic, melancholy register without drift. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, and the final exchange lands with warmth. No slips that touch closure; strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated-literary texture ("azure-coat," "skeletal docks," "sonic absolution") that fits the speculative world-building but occasionally drifts into over-poetic register during high-pressure beats ("his breath no longer a ghost in the cold"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the scavenger's lines carry goal-driven subtext. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are sparse. One friction: the scavenger's speech ("You're the keeper") and Elias's reply feel slightly expository, serving clarity over naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is evident in "the way light bent and shadows stretched when the earth tilted just so." The two lines of dialogue are brief but goal-driven and carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the kneeling beat, wider during expository reflection. Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon (horizon mapper, vigilant), though "unyoke" and "moon paths" risk slight register elevation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Psychic distance is controlled, and the investigator's attention to "engravings—tiny, deliberate marks" fits his role. However, register drifts into elevated metaphor under stress: "its light cutting through the gloom like a scalpel," "the tunnel seemed to breathe, its walls pulsing with unseen energy." Dialogue is minimal and functional; Voss's lines carry villainy but no subtext. The perceptual signature (watchful precision) holds but doesn't modulate under peak fear.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during guilt, slightly elevated during backstory). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though some phrases ("vibrant hush," "like broken promises") tip toward self-conscious lyricism. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Kael's lines carry subtext and advance plot. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy. Brief convergence of narrative register during the storm exit reads intentional and does not fracture voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual texture ("the lie tasted like copper," "his teeth ache"). Elias's voice carries through diction choices and the narrative modulates with pressure (shorter sentences as urgency rises). However, "steadily curious" and "throughout the evolution of his life" read as unearned elevated diction outside the focalizer's plausible register mid-crisis. Veyra's dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or goal beyond warning.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Lena's perceptual signature (scanning profiles, "chasing something that refused to be found") establishes investigative idiom. Elias's video monologue delivers key exposition cleanly, though "Nexis is erasing people… rewriting history" reads slightly on-the-nose for a whispered confession. Psychic distance holds, but narrative certainty wobbles: Lena "knew better" and "suspected" claims confidence the text hasn't yet dramatized. Diction stays consistent except for one slip: "brightly attentive" feels externally imposed rather than voice-organic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias throughout. Diction wobbles between elevated register ("shadow-laced," "weighted silence before reply," "anomaly of his own courage") and simpler action beats, but the voice remains legible. Narrative certainty exceeds Elias's knowledge in places (the child's reflection "wasn't for herself" is asserted without dramatization). The phrase "weighted breath before reply" recurs as a frame device but its meaning and connection to the action remain opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "gripped reality loosely," "time itself had folded into a pocket of patience." Elias's way of noticing (thin skin, slowed thought, the parasol's warmth) is selective and consistent. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: "You're one of them, aren't you?" lands without explanation. The woman's sparse lines feel natural. Diction remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is intentional and serves the muted emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Liora; distance is stable and interior access concrete (traced edge, fogged breath, tremor in hands). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext: Elias's "I had to" and "I finally understood" advance reconciliation; Liora's "Why now?" tests his resolve. Perceptual signature is present—winemaker's vocabulary, attention to earth and vine—but the prose occasionally shifts into elevated register ("nurturing intersubjective understanding," "gently persuasive") that sits outside her established idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Elias's voice could be more distinct from the narrator's reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "murmuring pavilion," "kinetic parapet pulsed," sensory anchors filtered through the line walker's awareness. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("dusk-gray as the dunes," "thread of golden light, thin as a spider's silk"). The prophet's dialogue bypasses lips and "settled into the line walker's bones"—purposeful deviation that supports the piece's metaphysical texture. However, interior voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("peripheral awareness," "unspoken knowledge") that reads more like concept-labeling than embodied thought under pressure. Dialogue mechanics are clean when present; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. Strong execution with minor register slips in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct contemplative texture ("subtle puzzle archivist," "perceptively calm") with controlled psychic access to Elias's interiority. Diction remains largely consistent, though occasional phrases ("transmute their pain into a masterpiece," "the tapestry") drift toward elevated register without clear character motivation. The narrative voice modulates little under the minimal pressure, and some lines ("As vines climb, so too did the stories…") read as authorial metaphor rather than Elias's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The prose reads as committee consensus—lyrical and polished but without the idiosyncratic grain that would anchor it to Elias's specific way of noticing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV, third-limited, stable distance. Voice has texture: "reticent scholar," "sonically reflective," "suspended hush," perceptual filter anchored in reverence. Psychic distance tightens purposefully when he presses the crystal to his temple and the world "blurred, then sharpened." No head-hopping. Diction mostly fits the scholarly register, though "sonically reflective" (unusual phrasing for non-technical narration) and "demanding to be heard" (slight cliché) introduce minor roughness. Elision is minimal and purposeful. Consistent tense and clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the prophet notices sound (static silence, mechanical hum, creaking rope) and memory-texture (fog "thick as memory," sand through fingers). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("precognitively forgetful," "marrow of his bones"), though occasional phrases ("chest tightened," "breath hitched") recur as bodily clichés. The woman's dialogue is brief and serves purpose, but her voice lacks distinct idiom beyond oracle-speak ("You always forget," "Now you can listen"). No head-hopping; focalization stays clean. Internal voice modulates appropriately with the prophetic, lyric register, though filter verbs ("he had come," "he had spent") are frequent without harming immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature—tools, sky, camera mechanics—reads as character-appropriate. Diction is elevated but consistent ("luminous ache," "ephemeral"). However, the prose sometimes drifts into abstract register ("the weight of a revelation," "proof that escape velocity was not just a concept") that reads more like narration for the reader than Elias's interior lexicon under stress. The final paragraph's rhythm ("the sound of the stars, the sound of a leaf falling, the sound of time itself spinning free") is purposeful and lyric, though it risks preciousness. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV through Elias remains stable and anchored in his perceptual signature (the vinyl shard, guitar strap, embodied memory). Lena's dialogue ("Hymn the mundane") carries distinct idiom and goal-driven subtext, contrasting with Elias's measured responses. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external action (entering the room) to interior memory (mother's song) to embodied emotion (tight throat). The prose rhythm shifts appropriately with pressure: short exchanges during the song request, slower cadence during the vigil. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the final image holds narrative stance without explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and matches a scholarly observer: "latent energy," "warping space," "ozone and old metal." The guardian's voice—"wind through a cracked window"—carries some distinctness, though brief. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear in peak beats without undermining immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent (rune-scholar lens) but not deeply character-particular. No major voice leakage or mechanical template cadence, though the prose lacks a strong rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person close stays consistently with Lena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "shrewdly innocent question: *What if?*" and "bone-setting rituals of the old world" anchor her worldview. Minor register drift: "the kind that lived in the spaces between breaths" and "letting the nostalgia of it wash over her" edge toward elevated diction that doesn't quite fit a woman kneeling in dirt. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and goal-driven. The child's "Because they didn't know how to keep me... But you do" advances the final turn cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice carries a distinct lyric texture (grotto "exhaled," sea glass "reflectively vibrant"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the pearl touch. Narrative stance remains consistent; perceptual signature is poetic and attentive to texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. The phrase "like a sleeping dragon" and "drowned things clawing" are vivid but approach stock metaphor territory; the prose stays character-particular otherwise, keeping the score in the solid 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during the notebook reveal, breathes in the moss-garden frame). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices patterns (icicle lace, branching lines, Mira's shoulder tension) in observational detail. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext ("Not to judge...To understand"). Brief diction slip: "honeyed" and "hush" feel slightly elevated against the otherwise grounded lexicon, though the final "honeyed hush" ties to prior honey offerings. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and maintained: literary, precise, slightly archaic ("cloying," "solemnize," "lucidly watchful"), filtered through a novelist's habit of seeing the world as text ("like sentences half-formed," "the whisper of closing pages"). Psychic distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (perceiving mist as narrative, characters as drafts) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the boy's plea and the protagonist's rebuke both advance pressure. One brief filter stack ("he realized") is voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the singing beat, slightly wider in the opening catalog). Perceptual signature is strong: "scent of crushed mint and something older, something like the echo of a lullaby" is specific and lyric. Diction remains consistent—no register drift. The single line of dialogue ("Alright, what do you need?") feels natural and goal-driven. Compression in the climax ("She laughed, giddy and breathless") is voice-motivated and supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is controlled (slow breath, frost, pale sky, the way light bends). Diction remains voice-consistent: "breath curling in slow, deliberate plumes," "quiet thrum of existence." No head-hopping. Elision is minimal and purposeful (decades compressed into "he had found it in a ruin"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with the ritual's pace—long, deliberate sentences in arrangement beats, shorter final line for release. Filter verbs ("seemed to sigh") appear once and read voice-motivated rather than stacked. No dialogue present; single-character piece.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-close; no head-hopping. Voice is poetic and consistent ("peripherally focused," "the lull of a wounded season"), with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices light fractures, gear teeth). Diction remains elevated throughout, matching the meditative tone. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks. The piece does not contain dialogue. Under pressure (the reflection's appearance) the prose maintains rhythm without syntactic monotony, and the final image ("sound of time rewinding") sustains the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyric register ("fractal weaver," "boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush") that remains internally consistent. Diction is purposeful and compression is taught early, establishing a poetic, meditative stance. However, perceptual signature is thin—Liora's way of noticing doesn't shift under pressure—and key moments lean on filter verbs ("she watched," "she knew") that dull immediacy. The narrative distance feels uniform rather than modulated by emotional intensity, and the final paragraphs explain rather than trust the image to land.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices texture (rough grain, warped floorboards), domestic rituals (kettle whistle, tea unfurling), and the quality of absence. Diction stays controlled and purposeful ("fractured light," "drowning dancers," "crystallize time"). No head-hopping. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she imagined," "the image dissolved") in the kettle-pouring beat is voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the carving sequence, and the final paragraph's compression ("for the first time in years") reflects earned closure rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a perceptual signature rooted in collection and fragmentation. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"regret clung to her like the damp mist," "a sound like time slipping through fingers"—and the ghost's dialogue carries subtext ("you took too long"). However, the ghost's lines edge toward thematic ventriloquism at closure ("time doesn't care what you think") and the final paragraph's "she heard the world without flinching" shifts into summary assertion rather than dramatized perception under the POV's established filter.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's professional idiom ("load-bearing points," "calculating") anchors voice. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and the woman's weary tone distinguishes her. The repeated phrase "redirected flows" and "maze of intentions" feel slightly imposed rather than spontaneous thought. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from observation to reflection without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV control is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (clockmaker's eye, sensory detail) remains consistent. Diction fits his interiority without register drift. The girl's dialogue ("Please, can you fix it?") is minimal but natural. Minor slip: "the way the rain made the stones hum" late in the piece introduces a sensory detail Elias hasn't visited in years, yet he recalls it with immediate certainty. The narratorial confidence stays within bounds, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person close maintains stable distance and the prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("errant legend seeker," "architecture of lies"). Psychic distance remains consistent, though filter verbs ("he had learned," "he had trained") occasionally dull immediacy. The mirror figure's dialogue—*"You've been looking in the wrong places"*—advances plot but feels abstractly authorial rather than voice-specific. POV stays controlled with no head-hopping; perceptual signature leans toward the philosophical ("serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear") in ways that feel more thematic than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance-controlled. Diction fits Elias's contemplative register ("philosophical seed collector," "cipher," "alchemy"). Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices knots, patterns, the weight of centuries. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm modulates with fog and snow, creating atmospheric texture. Minor filter-verb stacks ("he could hear," "he thought he saw") slightly dull immediacy in the final paragraphs but do not break focalization or voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Lena notices weavers' needles "like fireflies," the queen's trembling hands). Diction modulates with pressure: the opening's lyric density ("autumn's breath curled through the branches like a sigh too tired to finish") compresses slightly in the climactic beat ("she closed her eyes"). One slip: "projecting presence into the spaces where absence had taken root" shifts into expository register that abstracts Lena's work rather than showing it through her lens. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; psychic distance tightens during the hatching. Diction is consistently elevated ("coiled around him," "inevitable grace of a flower unfurling") and matches the quaking-reverie tone. However, certain phrases ("the flaw in his genesis," "conceptual repricing" implied by "remembered into it") feel more authorial than character-filtered. Kaelen's perceptual signature—focused on pressed flowers, lute strings, iridescent colors—is consistent and purposeful, grounding the lyric register in concrete objects.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; diction mixes firefighter particulars ("boots," "calloused hands") with elevated, poeticized phrasing ("kelp-drift peace," "gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion"). The dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in the exchange with the girl, carrying mild subtext. However, register drifts into abstract lyricism in high-reflection beats ("grafted her past onto her present," "scars could sing"), weakening voice specificity under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent (fire-and-ruin filter) but lacks urgency modulation. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice carries literary texture ("luminous skeptic," "defiant hush," "sidereal patience") but risks ornamental density in peak beats—"fingers sifting through the detritus" and "woven from moonlight" prioritize lyricism over pressure. Elara's perceptual signature (reading stories from cracked tiles) is consistent. The grandmother's dialogue feels slightly expository ("memories don't stay trapped forever"). Distance and tense remain stable. Figurative density in the opening and apparition scene slightly dulls momentum without teaching a clear lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance throughout. Psychic access to Elias is consistent; Kael's interiority remains opaque, observed only through comms and ship movement. Perceptual signature is present but leans poetic-universal rather than character-particular—"swirl of violet and gold," "cosmic bloom"—fits the sci-fi register but lacks idiosyncratic bias. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and goal-driven; Kael's lines pursue confrontation, Elias's pursue explanation. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats, tightening during the activation sequence. Brief register elevation ("approximating infinity") fits the calculating-machine lexicon without jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with Elias's perceptual signature evident in reverent attention to texture (wet granite, frayed ribbon, brittle paper). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, matching the character's meditative occupation. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Minor friction: the narrator occasionally drifts into elevated register ("quiet alchemy," "thundering calm") that, while poetic, edges toward a unified lyric voice rather than strict character-bound observation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct: "ethically diligent," "quarter-turns of a winder's key," "gnomon" all reflect Elias's precise, ritualistic idiom. Psychic distance tightens during the transfer ritual. One register slip: "as if eager to outrun the past" anthropomorphizes the bob in a lyric register slightly above Elias's established voice. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("fragile pause between swings") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered under peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is consistent—mechanical, temporal, calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with clean focalization on Elias. Voice carries a distinct textural register ("velveteen gloom," "lapped at the shore like a cat at a saucer of milk") that sustains tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("blithe care of a gardener who saw beauty in the quiet persistence of roots") that feel more authorial than character-grounded. Perceptual signature is consistent but generic—Elias notices names, objects, threads—without idiosyncratic bias that reveals his particular way of seeing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register appropriate to the concept. However, psychic distance remains uniform—Elara's perceptual signature does not sharpen under pressure, and her internal texture stays abstract even as stakes rise. Phrases like "fertile ground beyond" and "landscape of choices" read as thematic placeholders rather than character-specific diction. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she noticed") appear but do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with distinct perceptual filters ("scent that clung to things long after their purpose had faded"). Diction is consistent and lyric-textured, though some phrases lean toward elevated register ("liquid gold," "mirage") that slightly tensions the humble copyist's idiom. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The focalization is clean, and the voice has a distinct cadence, but under peak pressure (the dust glowing) the prose remains descriptive rather than compressing or intensifying rhythm to match urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices warmth, breath curling, the portrait's shifting lines). Diction stays within a somber, lyric register without unmotivated drift. The mask-vision sequence uses clean free indirect style ("He understood now") that integrates realization into the present action. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the mask-wearing beat, then opens again for the final walk-away. One brief filter-verb cluster ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to shift") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with strong perceptual signature: Elias's focus on "ink-stained fingers," "rationally rebellious," the way he reads sediment as story. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("They called it progress. Elias called it cowardice"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The narrative distance modulates appropriately with his intensity. Psychic distance remains consistent and purposeful, and the prose carries a distinct intellectual texture that fits the character's philosopher bent without slipping into academic register inappropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent (Miss Voss notices "dissonant undertones," "the noise...in the silences"). The prose modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to the fragile zither beats to the quieter ending. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Sing with me"); the alto's "warm and slightly off-key" voice and Maren's scoff carry subtext. Filter verbs appear occasionally ("she saw the way Maren's hand found Liora's") but do not flatten immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift, and the psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual filter (chef's care, memory-tasting gift) colors some description (e.g., "infusing it with her own memories" parallels culinary craft). However, the prose drifts into elevated register at peaks: "synaptic plasticity, the brain's own way of bending and healing" and "the quiet strength of synaptic plasticity" read as expository intrusion rather than Mara's idiom mid-crisis. Narrative certainty exceeds what Mara can plausibly know ("the seed in her palm was warm, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat" before planting suggests mystical omniscience not grounded in her sensory frame). Rhythm and diction remain consistent outside these lapses, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly to Elias; no head-hopping. His perceptual signature—noticing the box's warmth, the "truth clawing up his throat"—is character-specific and consistent. Maren's dialogue ("You're holding it wrong") is goal-driven and terse, distinct from Elias's more reflective cadence. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: short clauses as they enter the tower, longer breath at the resolution. One minor slip: "the way the city's children had stopped believing in magic" is an unearned generalization Elias couldn't know as a toll keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable, distance intimate, perceptual signature distinct (Elias notices "the weight of unspoken things," "the shape of a sound"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "crouched," "the bay had decided, quietly, to stop pretending," "the ghost of a breath held too long." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close when the house stops, pulling back as he walks away). Syntax and rhythm support pressure: short clauses when the house pauses ("Not all at once, but in increments"), longer sentences in reflection. No dialogue to judge. Minor register wobble: "inadvertently profound" in the narrator's voice feels slightly elevated for the otherwise grounded texture, though it ties to a prompt element.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable; the diver's perceptual signature (deliberate movements, years of piecing fragments) is consistent and the statue's telepathic voice is italicized and distinct in rhythm. The prose modulates under pressure—short clauses when she recoils, longer reflection in calmer beats. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. The single weak moment: "incisively kind, cutting through her assumptions with surgical precision" edges toward meta-commentary about the story's own technique rather than dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Voice has distinct texture ("hope like a bruise," "regret, if regret had a smell") and perceptual filtering through Elias's mathematical lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("construct of perpetual motion," "ghost of what could have been") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. The philosophical interiority dominates without grounding in physical sensation or irrational impulse. No dialogue to evaluate. Prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric cadence, concrete images (sour yellow haze, liquid black ink), and a perceptual signature tied to moonlight and memory. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—building warmth in the final paragraphs—without register drift. Minor slip: "as if the brush itself was judging her" leans slightly toward filter-heavy introspection, but it does not obscure the focalizer's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and textured ("voice like aged parchment," "rosewater dread") with a distinct perceptual signature that notices historical traces and sensory decay. POV remains single and stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue, when present, is spare and goal-driven ("Shape it right, and maybe the bees will come back"). The flour-dust-on-fingers dream moment feels slightly convenient but is brief. Under peak stress (baking scene), diction remains coherent and the internal texture holds. Minor filter-verb reliance ("watched," "felt") in a few lines but not enough to dull immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable, filtering detail through Elias's clockmaker's eye: "a series of nested gears, each smaller than the last," "the same latent radiance hum beneath." Diction is controlled and voice-particular—"counter-clockwise persuasion," "the tide's slow exhale," "voices—drowned, desperate, hungry"—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at key beats: close when Elias traces the stone, pulled back when the world reverses. One minor slip: "Neatly inventive, Elias thought" reads as an attributive tag for a phrase that feels narrator-inflected rather than character idiom. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent gothic-lyric register ("warped by decades of neglect, yet somehow luminous"). The advisor's aphoristic voice is distinct. Diction remains elevated throughout ("unbosomed," "repulsive allure," "lingering luminance"), occasionally slipping into ornamental register ("threadbare murmur," "coiled around him") that distances rather than sharpens pressure. No dialogue between characters on the page. Perceptual signature leans toward atmospheric catalog; under peak stress (mirror lunge), syntax tightens slightly but retains the same lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature is consistent: Leeward perceives through tidal and musical metaphors ("fractal paths," "harmonics," "sea's audience"). Diction stays grounded in his idiom. A few lines drift toward elevated register under peak stress ("euphony," "restless heart of the world"), but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates purposefully with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature (cartographer's lens, pattern-reading) coloring observations. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, with selective compression ("sunwashed dread," "suffocating dark") that heightens pressure. The reed whistle's symbolic weight is handled without filter-verb stacks. One friction: "She had spent her life studying them through the lens of pattern languages" reads slightly expository for peak urgency, and the phrase "bound by some unseen rhythm" drifts toward abstraction when embodied detail would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature (foggy lenses, historian's bias) is consistent. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Liora's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit. The phrase "archivist of last resort" and diction like "noble lies" fit the historian lens. Distance modulates purposefully (close during the letter reveal, wider during backstory). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV, third limited; distance is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices texture, weight, absence. Diction fits the contemplative register, though "hushed blaze" and "archeologist of abandoned dreams" edge toward elevated phrasing that slightly distances. Free indirect style is clean. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (chest tightens at the final note). No dialogue to evaluate. Under peak stress, compression is minimal; the voice remains textured without overwriting. Minor filter-verb clustering ("he could feel," "he understood") in reflective beats, but not enough to stack penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's perceptions throughout. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("reclaimed stillness," "tranquilly perceptive") that fits an archivist's mindset. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices book spines, ink quality, ledger dates—details that reflect his professional lens. The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" appears as narrative claim rather than demonstrated perception under pressure, and some constructions lean formal ("the chaos of the sunken city above stilled into something almost sacred").

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is lyric and elevated, with a consistent perceptual signature (soot, solder, fractured rainbows, liquid silver). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought metaphor ("the sky a raw wound of violet and gold," "folding grief into origami cranes until her hands cramped") that abstracts rather than embodies. The piece maintains third-person limited throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable but the prose leans toward decorative lyricism over goal-driven clarity, especially in the final paragraph where stakes dissolve into atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's POV is stable and her perceptual signature—grief-soaked, wary, attuned to sound and heat—is consistent throughout. Diction like "dying beast," "ghost of a drone's hum," and "hunger in its hum" creates a distinct voice under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Show me") feels purposeful and minimal. Filter verbs ("she knew") appear frequently but do not obscure interiority. No head-hopping or distance breaks mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (sharp eyes, rough voice, years pulling fragments) is present but not deeply textured under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext ("Not decode. Reveal.") and pursues goals cleanly. However, elevated diction—"perpetually surprised by everything, as if the universe had just whispered a secret"—clashes with Elias's rough interiority in several beats, and filter verbs ("watched," "felt") dull immediacy where embodied perception would sharpen it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited remains stable with clean focalization through Elias's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "guilt was a sieve through which every breath passed" feels specific to his self-awareness. The uncle's dialogue carries naturalism and subtext ("Looking for something, genealogist?"), though his subsequent confession turns expository. Rhythm modulates well under pressure, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-limited holds steady; Elias's perceptual signature (salt/mist/father's house anchor) is consistent. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("They always do"). Diction fits the voice without drift. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess. The piece enters the 7-band on clean control but lacks the rhythmic tightening under peak pressure or elision-payoff structure that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Elias's perception. Perceptual signature is character-specific: eyes that "mapped stars instead of shorelines," the compass's "brass edges worn smooth by years of use and regret." Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close in the opening reflection, widening during paddling, tightening again at the island). However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("the backlash of regrets," "gravitating toward a small island") in a way that feels slightly imposed rather than fully naturalized to Elias's interior lexicon under stress. Diction mostly holds, and the rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats, but minor voice smoothness prevents higher reach.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "the cold calculus of a life spent serving the highest bidder," "the way he used to parse coded messages." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the mirror-memory beat. Dialogue between Elias and Mara carries subtext and advances plot ("You've got that look—the one that says you've done things you can't undo"), and their speech registers as distinct without filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "He wasn't looking for answers. He was looking for a reason to keep going" reads as template parallelism rather than voice-specific rhythm, but the lapse is brief and doesn't contaminate peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited through Liora's focalization; no head-hopping occurs. Voice carries distinct texture ("its scent thick with the memory of cinnamon and clove," "the language of beasts") and maintains a lyric, fairy-tale register. The dialogue between Liora and the ember-voice man ("You're not real" / "Not yet") advances plot and carries subtext (his acknowledgment of incompleteness). Minor friction: "paradoxically steady" and "a bond beyond death" drift toward elevated diction that edges out of embodied perception under peak stress. Perceptual signature is consistent (spices, scent, animal communication), and psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistently lyric and elevated, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "her heart a compass spinning toward some unseen north where lost time pooled like mercury"). POV remains stable third-person limited, and the diction matches the cartomancer's ritualistic, poetic focus. However, the prose occasionally drifts into over-wrought metaphor clusters that feel writerly rather than character-filtered ("the quiet, choking beauty of what endures"), and the psychic distance remains fixed at a middle remove throughout, never tightening under pressure or widening for strategic effect. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, but the voice does not modulate with emotional intensity—every sentence carries the same stately, metaphor-laden cadence, which flattens the urgency even as the piece claims profound emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric: "floating reliquary of human regret," "the residue of grief that had crystallized over centuries." Narrative distance contracts during photograph encounters (direct address, quoted accusations) then widens for summary closure beats. The perceptual signature—stitching wounds with memory, tracing shimmer—is consistent. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("suture," "articulate") but remains within a quasi-mythic narrator's lexicon. The opening "happy this morning" gravity detail feels slightly whimsical against the otherwise solemn tone but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("whispering hush," "celestial bodies") but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("texture of transformation," "paradox of the destitute philanthropist") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal; the woman's lines feel oracular and expository. Perceptual signature is present in the lightning bug focus but does not modulate under peak stress—Elias's internal voice remains steady rather than compressing or fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in limited third throughout. Mira's perceptual signature—"years memorizing every tumbler"—colors her attention to locks and vaults. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "winking hush," "coiling in her chest," "gears snapping together." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the parchment discovery. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Minor strain: "her thoughts snapping together like gears" edges toward mechanical metaphor, but the voice remains distinct and the prose modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with carefully controlled diction ("half-remembered dream," "living shadows," "embers in a dying fire") and a perceptual signature rooted in pattern-reading and sensory acuity. Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately as pressure rises, compressing toward the climax. Filter verbs ("felt," "noticed," "became clear") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, and no elision obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction frequently elevates into lyric register ("rarefied his anger," "storm-kissed wonder," "lullaby") that feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated by a censored poet under stress. The prose carries a distinct textural signature but risks authorial ventriloquism; phrases like "furiously tranquil" and "vigil in pause" read as crafted rather than perceived. Free indirect style is clean when present.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (the mechanical arm's whirring as reminder, his cartographer framing) is present but lightly sketched. Dialogue pursues goals but lacks subtext or distinct idiom—both characters speak in similarly elevated, declarative registers ("Chaos is where truth hides" / "questions become destinations"). No head-hopping, but voice feels consensus rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lumen's perceptual signature (poet's eye on margins, ink, verse). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between reflection and present action. Dialogue is spare, natural, and advances plot ("You knew I'd come?" / "Would you have believed me?"). The prose carries distinct texture ("teeth yellowed by prison coffee," "moon hung fat and white") and free indirect style is clean. Minor filter-verb stacking in early paragraphs ("had found," "had seen," "had been") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure voice or harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches what Elias can know. Perceptual signature is character-specific: he notices rhythm (rain on the roof), light (rearrange furniture to catch it), and music as emotional language. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("salt-tinged mist," "drunken dancers," "spilled ink"), with occasional elevated phrases ("strategic creativity," "loophole") that feel voice-motivated rather than jarring. No dialogue on the page to judge. Free indirect style is clean ("The chaos suited him. It was the only thing that made sense anymore"). One minor slip: "his wife had once teased" and "back when his oddities amused her" cycles synonym territory without adding pressure. Filter verbs ("he'd found," "he'd meant") are functional but stack in the backstory block.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable throughout; Liora's perceptual signature (glyphs, shifting seed, dream imagery) is consistent. The prose carries a faintly elevated register ("rustle in the undergrowth," "wind through dry reeds") that fits the fantastical setting. However, internal voice lacks sentence-level distinction—many lines could belong to any thoughtful protagonist. Nani's dialogue reads generic ("You've been avoiding the dreams"). The dream woman's line "Memory is a garden" feels like thematic shorthand rather than character-specific idiom. No head-hopping, but voice does not crystallize under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during compass and lace moments, slightly wider in transitions). Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent with the reflective, slow-spoken tutor's perceptual signature. The prose rhythm—long, weighted sentences with caesurae—matches Elias's measured nature. Figurative density is high ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret"), and while voice-motivated, it risks obscuring immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue is present. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he understood," "he felt") slightly dulls directness.

While the prose is pleasant, it doesn’t yet have a sharply distinctive idiolect; some phrasings (“her breath caught,” “the truth she had uncovered”) feel familiar. POV control is clean and unobtrusive, supporting clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that feels specific to Liora’s sensibility—sensory, regret-inflected, but not overwrought. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping naturally between external description and interior shading without POV leakage. Dialogue is sparse but apt, carrying subtext and pressure (“You still don’t”) rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates effectively, with longer, image-rich sentences for atmosphere and shorter admissions at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with an educated, trauma-seasoned translator: vocabulary like “palimpsest” and “fractal patterns” feels earned rather than imposed. The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying inside Lena’s sensibility while allowing a soft, reflective lyricism that matches the anesthetic haze. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively, with sensory-rich long sentences giving way to short emphatic lines (“The boy’s notes began to glow, the smudges resolving into a single word: *Home.*”). There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the boy’s silence reinforces his role as mirror rather than diluting the focal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly keyed to an artist obsessed with light and ruins; imagery and diction (“liquid gold,” “soak in the glow”) feel coherently filtered through her sensibility. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the small amount of dialogue fits the established tone. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately around key discoveries (the developed film, the old woman’s remark). The voice is distinctive without lapsing into self-conscious ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and colored by Elias’s profession and temperament (“like a pianist reluctant to strike the first chord” aligns with his methodical playfulness). Diction and syntax are controlled and varied, with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in sound and image; the accumulative rhythm of the “awakenings” is especially effective. There’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience, and the narrative stance maintains a believable access to his perceptions and inferences. A slight risk is the uniformly elevated register, which could be modulated a bit more under crisis to reflect his fraying composure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a subtle, slightly wry texture that fits both Elias’s scientific precision and Quill’s charm. Dialogue is clean and character-distinct—Quill’s glibness vs. Elias’s more formal register and the inspector’s clipped authority. POV distance is mostly stable, with only light omniscient touches (e.g., “known in certain circles”) that don’t disrupt coherence. Rhythm modulates well between description, banter, and moments of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature befitting an insomniac poet (spirals, armistices, reef-shadow joy). Diction and syntax feel intentional; images accrue rather than blur, and the narrative distance stays stable. There’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift, and the rhythm modulates appropriately at key beats (the breeze, the act of writing, the closing image). A few abstract formulations (“the rot of missing her”) lean more towards essayistic than embodied, but they remain within the character’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Liora’s sensibility, with controlled, image-rich diction. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, supporting the contemplative, accumulative mode. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” tone; the narration trusts image and implication. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable but not so ornate that it obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is assured and consistent, with a measured, lyrical register that matches an obsessive linguist in a haunted archive. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, tightening around key beats (“She had not expected the dead to answer.”) and breathing at reflective turns. The sparse dialogue is clean and weighted, and the narrative never slips out of Elara’s focalization into unearned omniscience. Overall, the prose feels controlled rather than showy, with a distinct texture that supports the speculative-literary tone.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and aligned with Mira’s technically minded yet reverent sensibility. Diction and imagery (brass gears whispering, chain like a silver river, adhesive like dried tears) feel cohesive and character-filtered rather than generic-poetic. The narrative distance stays consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or awkward register shifts. Some lines edge toward overt abstraction, but they don’t break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective, wounded intellectual; images like “like a blind man reading braille” feel character-specific rather than generic prettiness. POV remains cleanly inside Elias, with no leakage into Lena’s interiority. Dialogue is economical, tonal, and goal-driven, carrying subtext (her testing belief, his defensiveness) without exposition-dumps. Rhythm modulates well between description, interiority, and exchange, maintaining clarity under the lyric surface.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensory and conceptual obsessions (grain, light, weather codes). Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with a distinct texture that suits a reflective, haunted mind. The diction is elevated but feels internally plausible for this character, and there is no POV leakage or confusing distance shift. The voice sustains both atmosphere and interiority without resorting to explanation-heavy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical without losing clarity, and maintains a consistent, slightly haunted wonder throughout. Diction is mostly in character and does not slip into jarring registers; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, Elias’s perceptual signature could be more idiosyncratic—“landscape astrologer” hints at a very specific worldview that the prose only partially exploits. The brief dialogue is functional and natural enough, if not especially textured with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, speculative mood, with consistent access to Liora’s perceptions and no POV slippage. Phrasing like “cheerful gloom” and “sea-foam recollectionist” gives the prose a distinct texture without collapsing into mannerism. There is occasional reliance on familiar turns (“the air itself seemed to hold its breath”) but they don’t significantly undercut the voice’s individuality. Rhythm and diction largely modulate well with the rising unease in the tunnel and the softened acceptance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a controlled lyricism that suits Lira’s analytical yet romantic worldview. Phrasing like “lightly attentive” and “orchestrated serendipity” gives the narration a distinct texture without becoming mannered, and internal access feels plausibly tethered to her perceptions. There’s no POV leakage or register clash, and rhythm modulates reasonably well between stillness and motion. It stops slightly short of truly distinctive, unforgettable voice, but is very publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Liora notices tides, stars, and silence. Elevated diction and imagery (“gaps between the stars,” “poets of the flesh”) fit the mythic-fantastic register and do not clash with dialogue, which remains natural and goal-driven. POV control is clean; we never slip into the man’s interiority, and free-indirect moments stay within Liora’s sensibility. Occasionally the lyricism approaches density that could risk overrichness, but it remains legible and purposeful here.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet clear, with a distinct sensory bias toward light and texture that fits a glazier. Diction is elevated but not implausible for the narrative stance, and psychic distance remains stable. Dialogue is minimal but functional and in-character, especially the old woman’s simple, directive lines. Overall, the voice has personality without drawing attention away from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited POV on Elias is steady and confident, with no head-hopping and a clear psychic distance. The lyrical yet grounded voice—mixing technical awareness (fire patterns, wind currents) with poetic perception—reads as a distinct perceptual signature for a firefighter-poet figure. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, revealing history and stakes without exposition dumps. Rhythm and diction modulate well with emotional intensity, particularly around the box and the notebook.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, marrying scientific precision (“altitude gauge,” Fibonacci spirals) with lyric attentiveness to light and tide. Diction and rhythm remain coherent with Elara’s “logical dreamer” mind, and psychic distance is stable. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative confidence feels high. The prose texture is strong enough to be recognizable, even if it doesn’t yet push into truly idiosyncratic extremes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that fits an introspective, quasi-academic explorer character. Sentences vary in rhythm and do purposeful atmospheric work, and POV access remains stable without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse yet natural, with the woman’s lines slightly more formal and oracular in a way that suits her role. Occasional phrases (“sensitively perceptive nature”) feel self-conscious, but they don’t materially undercut the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Liora’s sensibility, with consistent psychic distance. Sentence rhythm and image choices (“breath held too long,” “mirrors of the world”) give the narration a distinct texture without drifting into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the watchman’s plainer speech subtly contrasts with the more poetic narration. There are no POV slips or stance mismatches, and the voice holds cleanly through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person narration on Liora is stable, with only light, plausible omniscient touches (“or so the monks claimed”) that fit her worldview. The prose has a distinct, slightly formal lyricism appropriate to a seasoned negotiator in a sacred setting. Dialogue is clean, economical, and character-distinguishing; Kessar’s blunt skepticism contrasts with Liora’s measured, “operatively gentle” tone. Rhythmic modulation—longer, descriptive openings narrowing to briefer, weightier lines at the end—supports emotional beats well.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a cool, morally ambivalent intellectual. Diction choices like “a slow, deliberate unraveling of the land’s veins” and “a relic from a species that had vanished” feel unified and character-appropriate. POV distance is steady, with clean access to Elias’s conceptual frame rather than sudden omniscient intrusions. Rhythm modulates well between exposition and present action, supporting the piece’s reflective, ritual-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and largely character-appropriate, with recurring attention to breath, body, and ritual that feels like Liora’s sensibility rather than a neutral narrator. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and key phrases such as “the space between sigh and smile” give the piece a distinct texture. There’s no head-hopping or unjustified distance shifts, and the narrative confidence matches what she can plausibly perceive. A few abstractions (“bodily poetic grace,” “alarming serenity”) veer slightly toward writerly rather than lived language, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive texture in metaphors (“meteor hush of distant waves,” “words spilling out like ink from a broken nib”).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, precise, and clearly colored by Liora’s esoteric realism, with a strong perceptual signature (“blushing stillness,” “moss drank the light”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with lyrical sentences that generally avoid vagueness and stay tied to concrete image. Narrative distance is well handled; we are close enough to feel her reverence and quiet ache without slipping into abstract philosophizing. There are a few lush turns that flirt with purple, but they are consistent with the established register and do not break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a lyrical yet controlled cadence that fits a craftsman contemplating his materials and his guilt. Phrases like “shaping hollows” and “a river of sound” feel voice-appropriate rather than generically poetic, and the narrative distance remains stable throughout. There is no dialogue to test, but interiority and description are sufficiently fused that the prose reads as Elias’s way of thinking rather than an external essay. The voice could potentially push further into idiosyncratic perception under stress, but as-is it’s strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a recognizable texture—organic metaphors, slow, contemplative cadence. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the woman’s lines read slightly expository yet fit her archetypal role. POV control is clean with no head-hopping or register whiplash. The main ceiling is that the narrative voice sometimes flattens into generalized “mystic” prose instead of sharpening specifically to Elias’s distinct sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“empirically ironic,” “encrypted devotion,” “dusky harmony”) that matches a learned, ritual-infused world. Third-person close on Nabu-sharru remains stable, and the elevated diction feels appropriate to the quasi-mythic register and his scholarly background. Dialogue is sparse but distinct, with the figure’s speech carrying an otherworldly cadence that contrasts with the astronomer’s grounded clarity. Occasional abstract phrasing brushes against grandiosity but does not undercut point-of-view control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches Elara’s reflective, conflicted mindset.

Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the voice feels distinct without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and suited to the fable-like tone, with controlled syntax and a consistent perceptual bias toward light, glass, and breath. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narration keeps to what the mirror maker can plausibly perceive or infer. Rhythmic variation and well-chosen metaphors prevent the prose from feeling monotonous despite its lyric density. At this standard, the voice is distinctive and confident, though not yet so idiosyncratic or risk-taking as to feel utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that fits Liora’s sensibility (e.g., “vows…turned deciduous”). Dialogue sounds natural for both characters and carries subtext: the girl’s bluntness and Liora’s hedged wisdom play off each other cleanly. The perceptual signature—attention to cracks, age, and re-use—is coherent throughout and quietly character-revealing. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the prose modulates well between description and spoken lines.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, slightly elevated but in keeping with a contemplative curator in a surreal setting. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the diction (“brightened disquiet,” “ledger of possibilities”) feels like a coherent perceptual signature. POV control is steady with no head-hopping; reflective passages are anchored in concrete sensations (water, tub, shell). The lyric register occasionally comes close to abstracting away from her embodied experience, but not enough to blur stance or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly lyrical texture that suits the fantastical academic setting, and it stays consistent in stance. Diction like “off-key note in an unheard symphony” and “dead languages of plants” gives Elara a particular way of seeing. Dialogue is natural, economically tagged, and advances stakes (especially in the negotiation and at the door). There’s minor omniscient framing early but it doesn’t cause POV drift or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with recurring phrases (“blissfully aberrant,” “unkindled solace”) giving it a recognizable texture. POV is stable and anchored in Elias’s perceptions, and the brief dialogue with Liora feels natural and appropriately oblique. Rhythm and diction modulate with the story’s shift from exploratory to numinous without breaking character plausibility. It’s distinctive and confident, if a touch writerly in places.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and appropriate to an archivist: calm, observant, and attuned to objects and records. Syntax and diction are clean and moderately lyrical without slipping into purple or incoherent metaphor. However, the narrative texture feels more generally literary than sharply individualized to Liora; it lacks a strongly idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would elevate it to top-tier distinctiveness. The single disembodied line of dialogue from the shadows is effective and doesn’t disturb POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a gently lyrical, sensory-driven texture well-suited to the acoustic and luminous setting. Diction and syntax remain stable and controlled; psychic distance is appropriate and doesn’t slip. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated register shift, and the cadence modulates reasonably with tension (slightly tighter around the binding and escape). While the voice is pleasant and fitting, it’s not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring that it feels unmistakable or singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and lyrically inflected without losing clarity. Phrasing like “to remind the stars they were still being watched” and “a shard of hush” gives the piece a distinct texture aligned with Elias’s contemplative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive, slightly archaic-lyric diction that suits the fantastical observatory and Elara’s archival sensibility. Sentence rhythm varies well between lush description and tighter, more focused lines at key realizations and decisions. Occasional aphoristic formulations flirt with abstraction but stay anchored enough in image and character to avoid feeling like authorial intrusion. The perceptual signature—what she notices, how she metaphorizes—remains clearly her own throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with images like “stone petals” and “the night… like a held breath” establishing a distinct sensibility. Diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than florid, and the narrative distance stays steady, inhabiting Liora’s perceptions without head-hopping. Shifts in cadence around key beats (striking the match, the figures appearing, the final kneeling) are handled smoothly. The voice is strong enough for publication, even if it doesn’t quite break into unmistakably singular territory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, supple, and distinctly Liora’s—attuned to small marine behaviors, temporal textures, and sideways thought.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how Liora experiences sound and silence. Elevated diction (“xenial lattice,” “gilded hush”) largely matches the piece’s fablelike, speculative tone and stays coherent. Dialogue is spare but distinct and functional, carrying subtext about belonging and risk without over-explaining. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough for embodied experience while occasionally widening for world-anchoring metaphors in a way that feels intentional rather than leaky.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice through Elias is stable and well-controlled, with lyrical but not opaque diction and a clear perceptual bias toward sound and pressure. Prose rhythms vary nicely, and the occasional heightened line (“a rhythm as fluidly logical as breathing”) fits the contemplative tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural, distinguishing her tentative need from his grounded assurance without feeling expository. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the lyricism feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and clear, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits a lore keeper in a mythic-futurist world. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and perception is consistently filtered through Veyra, with no head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled, somber rhythm that suits the material. Diction is elevated but not mannered, and imagery tends to echo the emotional state. Dialogue is minimal yet natural and purposeful, particularly the child’s line about teaching “suffocating to breathe.” There are no POV slips or register jolts; the only mild limitation is that the voice at times feels more narrator-generic than idiosyncratically hers.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and occasionally striking (“beneath the earth’s damp breath,” “colors that shouldn’t exist”) without drifting into incongruous register. POV boundaries are respected; we never know more than Elias can plausibly infer, and the speculative elements are filtered through his sensibility. The narrative texture is competent and sometimes lyrical, though the voice feels more generally polished than sharply idiosyncratic to Elias. A few more distinctive turns of perception tied to his con-man-burned past could individualize it further.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, slightly archaic lyricism that suits archives and dynastic secrets. Diction (“first yawn of evening,” “eloquently silent,” “standing waves”) is distinctive without becoming incoherent or breaking POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a lush, gothic-lyric texture that suits the material (“a sky that had forgotten dawn,” “the sound of leaves skittering over graves”). Dialogue differentiates the woman’s eerie, insinuating cadence from Aldric’s near-silence, and the narrative distance remains stable. A few lexical choices (“factually mystical”) slightly jar against the otherwise seamless register. Overall, it’s a distinctive and confident voice that carries the story’s atmosphere effectively.

A few abstract formulations (“the slow rot of too many promises”) skim close to generalized commentary but stay within a believable narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with strong rhythmic variation and an eye attuned to light, sound, and texture in a way that feels specific to a musician. Diction stays coherent—elevated but not mannered—and there’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. The narrative stance modulates appropriately between atmospheric distance and closer embodiment during the playing sequence. While the voice is strong, it could sharpen Elias’s idiosyncratic thought-patterns a notch more to feel utterly singular at the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with an idiosyncratic lexicon that fits both Liora’s ordering mind and the mythic setting. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, flowing sentences supporting the meditative tone without drifting into confusion. The narrative stance stays inside Liora’s perceptual field even when it adopts slightly elevated diction. There is no head-hopping or register shock, and the modulation at the ending (calmer, almost devotional) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that fits a contemplative tinkerer. Syntax is varied enough to avoid monotony, and key images (frozen mid-tick gears, mist, clockwork figures) are rendered with control. At times the narration slides into abstract or meta-philosophical diction that feels less like Elias’s embodied perception and more like authorial commentary (“befriend uncertainty in planning,” “concept of time”), which slightly flattens the perceptual signature. Overall, though, the POV and tone are stable and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated lyric register that suits Liora’s analytical, alchemical mind. Diction and rhythm show purposeful variation—lyric description balanced with plainer, clipped beats at moments of discovery or shock. Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct enough (Elias’s simple “You came” / “Forgive”) to contrast with the more ornate narration. At times, the prose skirts the edge of abstraction or self-conscious phrase-making, but it remains legible and grounded in her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a clear lyrical texture (“sky bled a hidden sunrise,” “voice like wind through dry reeds”) that fits the material. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with a slight tonal distinction between the world-weary collector and the remembering ghost. POV control is clean and consistent, with no head-hopping or register jolts. While the voice is pleasing and apt, it’s not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady and distinct, with controlled, slightly clinical diction that suits a character nicknamed “the Calculator” (“each joint a calculated equation”). Imagery and syntax reflect Elias’s analytic yet traumatized mind, blending bodily perception with mathematical and ultraviolet motifs without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but effective and differentiated—the stranger’s “voice like dry leaves” and ritualistic lines contrast with Elias’s contained responses. Occasional explanatory sentences feel a bit expository, but overall distance control and tonal consistency are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly aligned with Liora’s sensibility; metaphors and diction feel like her way of perceiving. Dialogue, while brief, is natural and character-distinct (the alchemist’s roughness, the artist’s amused obliqueness).

The voice is distinctive without slipping into self-conscious ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent texture: concrete, slightly lyrical, and tuned to mechanics and residual hauntings (“faces in the plaster, whispers in the wiring”). Mira’s perceptual signature—dust patterns, hinges, mainspring teeth, ceiling fissures—feels specific to her profession and history. Rhythm and diction are controlled without calling undue attention to themselves, and POV boundaries are clean. It’s distinctive and assured, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the mythic-surreal material. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with a measured lyricism that modulates as pressure rises without drifting in register or stance.

While the voice is more in the shared idiom of contemporary literary SFF than utterly singular, it’s executed at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“gilded relic,” “burnished sorrow”) that feels appropriate to Elias’s sensibility. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping and a stable psychic distance that modulates toward closer interiority at the end. Dialogue is brief but effective, with Liora’s sharper, more utilitarian diction contrasting Elias’s poetic framing. The elevated register occasionally nears the edge of uniformity, but it remains legible and character-anchored rather than generic purple.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a tactile, slightly archaic lyricism that suits a craftsman in a ruined, quasi-magical world. Elias’s perceptions are consistently mechanical and sensory, while the stranger’s dialogue has a distinct, oracular cadence. The narrative diction drifts toward the poetic but generally stays coherent and controlled. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“world of rust and ruin,” “weight of something just beyond his understanding”) that feel more generic than the rest of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elias’s sensibility and the story’s uncanny premise. Diction choices (“smokestacks like broken teeth,” “resonant hush,” “hinged awakenings”) feel unified and controlled, and the psychic distance is consistently close without slipping into omniscient commentary. The narrative stance remains stable and confident, with no head-hopping or register glitches.

    The close third-person voice is confident, with a clear perceptual signature (archival metaphors, attention to documents and physical records) that fits Elara’s profession and obsession. Prose modulates appropriately between atmospheric description and tighter, more direct language as danger escalates, and the omniscience never slips beyond what’s plausibly available. Dialogue is economical and mostly natural, carrying information and emotional charge without exposition-dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is assured and consistent, with elevated but not overwrought diction suited to literary fantasy.

    The third-person close voice is confident, with a distinct texture of imagery and diction that feels suited to a haunted ex-tracker: “maps of the dead,” “a perfume of the world before the fires.” POV distance is stable and controlled; we never leave Elias’s perceptual frame, and exposition about wars and tech is filtered through his experience. Lyric flourishes are generally purposeful rather than self-indulgent, and the motif of sound (wind, echoes, phonograph) coheres at the sentence level. A hair more modulation between dense lyric description and plainer narration at key turns could heighten their punch.

A few phrasings lean toward generic high-fantasy abstraction, but they don’t disrupt POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, especially in the way mechanical and bodily details are noticed. Diction choices (“kintsugi intentions,” “quilt of half-remembered dreams”) feel coherent with a haunted alchemist rather than generically poetic. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance stays stable without unmotivated omniscience. At peak moments, the lyricism edges toward uniform intensity, leaving little modulation between quiet and climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct texture that marries occult technicality (“induction coil,” “induced currents”) to lyrical sensory description in a way that feels specific to Elias.

    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable and mostly well-controlled, with only small slips into explanatory exposition. Prose texture has distinctive touches (“a sound like embers settling,” “volcanic tenderness”) that feel voice-appropriate rather than ornamental.

Narrative distance stays controlled; we never head-hop and the limited bits of dialogue sound natural and age-appropriate. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive reverie and forward motion during the chase. A small limitation is that in peak beats the narration retains a similar measured poise, so we don’t get a sharper tonal compression that might further distinguish high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice feels consistent and distinct: analytic yet haunted, with a lexicon suited to someone who treats stories like geological strata. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between description and interior reflection, and the sparse dialogue (text messages, her murmurs) serves function rather than exposition.

Filter verbs and explanatory sentences are minimal, and psychometric phenomena are rendered through image rather than explanation. The voice could risk a bit more sharpness or idiosyncrasy at peak pressure, but it is already strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical texture that matches Liora’s star-obsessed sensibility. Diction and rhythm show control, and the accumulative pattern of cosmic metaphors feels deliberate rather than haphazard. There’s some risk of homogeneity—many sentences share similar cadence and high-register imagery—but the piece stays legible and emotionally coherent. Absence of dialogue simplifies POV management and keeps the interior focus clean.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady and confident, with some striking images (“a lullaby sung through broken glass,” “occasionally everywhere”) that give it texture. Psychic distance remains consistent and aligned to Elias’s perceptions. The elevated register sometimes tilts toward generalized, quasi-scientific abstraction (“through wave functions”) that feels more prompt-driven than character-specific. Still, POV control is clean and the narrative stance fits the story’s quietly uncanny mode.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lucid, lyrical texture that suits the meditative, speculative mode. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the “perceptual signature” of someone attuned to mechanical and natural subtleties comes through in how details are noticed (sounds, textures, vibrations). POV is stable and modest, without unjustified knowledge or head-hopping. The guardian’s speech matches the elevated narrative register, which keeps things coherent but slightly flattens distinction between voices.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and lightly lyrical, with a calm, measured cadence that suits a twilight crossing. Elias’s and Mira’s dialogue is believable and goal-oriented, with subtext in their exchange about running from versus toward something. The narrative occasionally slips into a more omniscient or aphoristic register, but not so far as to break focalization or tone. Overall, the voice has a distinct gentle gravitas, even if it doesn’t yet feel fully idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with consistent wintry-gothic diction that suits Elias’s sensibility. POV is stable, with no leakage, and the prose modulates smoothly between description and scene. Dialogue is sparse but functional, tending toward aphoristic lines that match Madame Veyra’s role as institutional mouthpiece. Overall, the voice feels confident and coherent, if a touch mannered in places.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive metaphorical texture (“diminutive titan,” “blade through parchment”). The diction feels plausibly elevated for this quasi-mythic fantasy register and for a character steeped in scholarship. Rhythm varies nicely, with long, sinuous sentences giving way to sharper declaratives at key turns (“The time for unmasking had come.”). At times the narration leans more toward an omniscient-lyric register than strictly Liora’s internal idiom, but the stance remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close-third voice is consistent, with a restrained, slightly lyrical texture that fits Elara’s scientific yet haunted perspective (“periodic eternity,” “full of ghosts”). Diction remains coherent and avoids register clashes, and the AI’s clipped line contrasts effectively with the otherwise sensory-rich narration. While not radically distinctive, the perceptual signature—attention to rhythm, data gaps, and environmental cues—feels unified and controlled. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Lira notices light, texture, and sound. Diction is elevated but suits the reflective, speculative tone and avoids register clashes. There are no POV slips or unmotivated shifts in distance, and the narrative modulation from stillness to intensifying hum to roar is smooth. The absence of dialogue is appropriate for the chosen solitude and does not harm dynamism at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with sensory-rich attention that feels specific to Mira’s earthy, age-worn perspective. Psychic distance is well-controlled, sliding between immediate perception (“steam rose in lazy coils”) and compressed history without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Lina’s few lines distinguish her youth and awe from Mira’s seasoned resolve. The only ceiling here is that voice rarely sharpens into a more idiosyncratic or surprising rhythm under peak stress; it stays uniformly polished.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice around Lena is consistent, textured, and modulates well between lyric description and tighter focus under stress (e.g., during the drone pass). Diction and rhythm feel controlled and distinct without tipping into mannerism, and brief dialogue sounds natural and economical. There is a slight hint of external authorial stance in statements like “Mira’s motivation had always been…,” but it doesn’t break coherence or distance. Overall, the perceptual signature—what Lena notices and how—is strong and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and character-inflected, with diction and imagery that reflect Elias’s sensibility as an artist and melancholic thinker. The prose modulates well, from more expansive description early to a tighter, more pressurized rhythm as the walls close in. Rhetorical questions and figurative language are recurrent but feel like part of his mental texture rather than generic lyricism. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty stays within what Elias can plausibly experience and infer.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Elias is consistent, with controlled, slightly lyrical prose that fits his observant, haunted disposition. Diction (“his albino eyes, sharp as broken glass,” “serene anger”) feels unified and purposeful rather than showy for its own sake. Psychic distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. A few phrases verge on familiar genre cadence, but overall the narrative voice has a distinct, confident texture appropriate to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical yet controlled diction that fits both the fantastical archive and Elias’s reflective temperament. The prose maintains a consistent psychic distance, slipping into near-poetic turns without breaking POV plausibility. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and patterned phrases (“the letter was a key, and the library was the lock”) feel intentional rather than generic. A few lines adopt a more essayistic, thesis-like register that momentarily sound like authorial commentary rather than Elias’s lived perception, but these are not frequent enough to seriously damage voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistently colored by Liora’s sensibility, with a lyrical yet readable texture. Diction (“tranquil blazes,” “engraved quiet”) feels unified rather than showy, and the psychic distance stays stable. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, revealing status and history efficiently (“You always were too soft”). The voice rarely over-explains, trusting image and gesture to carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the mythic, slightly eerie register of the material. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, with recurring patterns (“He had…”, “The garden…”) used more as intentional cadence than lazy template. Diction fits the world—lyrical but not academically abstract—and the focalization stays firmly with Kael without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. The voice is distinctive and controlled, if not yet so idiosyncratic that it’s instantly unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)

Diction and syntax feel plausibly Elara’s, slightly elevated without drifting into academic abstraction, and the narrative distance stays steady. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the journalist’s lines adding urgency and Elara’s remarks (“Obituaries are for the living, not the dead”; “Then I won’t”) carrying subtext and resolve.

Diction and syntax remain coherent with Elias’s perspective and the story’s genre-inflected mood; there is no head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythmic control is good, with sentence lengths modulating around key beats like the first tattoo and final silence. A few metaphorical flourishes verge on self-conscious, but they don’t disrupt clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that feels congruent with an observant, artistic mind. Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language tends to be purposeful rather than ornamental. Dialogue is clean, natural, and carries subtext (Maren’s ambivalence about unlearning, Liora’s defensive reliance on “the sand doesn’t lie”). There are a few familiar turns of phrase, but they don’t significantly dilute the distinctiveness of the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“warm coldness,” “quiet furnace of defiance”).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice anchored in Elias is steady, and the diction—lyrical but controlled—fits both character and setting. Liora’s dialogue has a slightly different timbre (dry, wistful, edged with skepticism), giving her presence weight without breaking POV boundaries. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support the rising strangeness of the magic moment. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative stance remains confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a tactile, image-rich perceptual signature (“smelled of ozone and burnt sugar,” “willowglass hope”). Diction fits a thoughtful, slightly lyrical protagonist; the narrative doesn’t suddenly leap into academic register despite a neuroscience concept. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-revealing, especially the “Prove it” refrain. Some metaphoric choices verge on decorative, but they don’t disrupt POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches Eira’s sensory vocation (“echo of dripping water, the way light fractured through calcite like broken glass”). Psychic distance is well-handled: we stay inside her perceptions while allowing slightly elevated language that still feels like her noticing. The entity’s speech is clearly distinguished by its bone-vibrating, non-aural quality, avoiding head-hopping or stance confusion. A few metaphoric formulations are familiar enough to slightly blunt the distinctiveness, but overall the voice is confident and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture of metaphors that feel native to Mira’s perception (thread, buttons, sand, echo).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a clear, slightly elevated, reflective texture that matches a wounded, hyper-aware ex-spy. Diction and imagery are controlled and mostly character-plausible, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately at key beats (opening the pillbox, reading the file). Lyricism feels intentional rather than generic, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few phrasings (“unused courage waited”) lean more toward authorial essay-voice than character-specific perception, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrically inclined, and plausibly aligned with a contemplative older man, balancing concrete detail with metaphor. Phrases like "ambient awareness" and "palimpsest promise" edge toward a more essayistic register, but they don't break coherence, and the overall diction/rhythm feel controlled. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays in a close, reflective mode appropriate to a quiet story. Sentence-level rhythm modulates well between longer, meditative lines and shorter beats at moments of action.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly attuned to texture and light—very much a potter’s, craft-informed gaze. Diction and metaphor are controlled (“phototropic to kindness,” “cracks…catching the light like veins”) and give the prose a recognizable signature without tipping into opacity. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflection anchored to concrete stimuli (clay, light, wind through hives). The voice modulates gently toward a more charged stillness at the end, suiting the conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistently filtered through Lira’s perceptions, and comfortably handles both sensory detail and abstraction. Lexicon and rhythm match the contemplative, speculative tone: phrases like “books that floated like islands in the air” and “atomically reflective” feel stylistically cohesive. There are minor patches of generic phrasing and thesis-like commentary, especially near the end, that flatten the otherwise textured voice. Still, POV distance and stance remain stable, with no head-hopping or jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature centered on patterns, threads, and reflected fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV on Mara is steady and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent access to her perceptions and stakes. Prose has a mild lyricism (“edge of revelation,” “spaces between the stars”) that suits the subject without drifting into purple. Dialogue is mostly natural and functional, and the status dynamic between Mara and Voss is readable, though his voice borders on stock in a few lines. The narrative voice could lean more distinctly into Mara’s idiolect or cognitive habits to feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, lyrical texture that suits the material and stays anchored in Elias’s perceptions. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between dense atmosphere and sharper beats in the encounter. Dialogue is functional and mostly natural for this sort of speculative scene, though the figure’s lines are a bit expository by design. Overall, the perceptual signature (what he notices and how) feels consistent and character-shaped.

There are no POV slips or stance confusions, though the voice leans more polished-lit than deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “pixelated amnesty,” “saved as a low-res file and never properly rendered”). Diction is elevated but feels organic to the piece’s lyric aims and to a character tuned to subtle sensory data. Psychic distance is well-controlled, gliding between close interiority and slightly more panoramic description without confusion. The voice sustains its texture under the mild pressures present, though it’s seldom tested in truly extreme moments.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s perceptual biases (his attention to money textures, relics of failed enterprises, and subtle sounds). Syntax and rhythm are varied and often musical; metaphor use is controlled and generally apt for his reflective mood. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative stance stays firmly in his orbit even when summarizing backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-suited to a reflective, quietly mystical story; diction like “lucid dream chronicler” and “air hum with possibility” builds a recognizable tonal signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between sensory detail and interior realization. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated register feels plausible for a thoughtful, guild-affiliated observer. A few lines generalize mood rather than channeling it through Elias, but not enough to materially blunt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice feels steady and character-consistent, with controlled lyricism that matches Veyra’s severity and history. Diction like “warlike serenity” and “truths that refused to stay hidden” fits a seasoned druid rather than an abstract essayist. The narrative doesn’t withhold facts she clearly knows; it lets them surface under pressure as the plant works. A touch more modulation in rhythm at the peak (more fragmentation or compression under pain) might sharpen the sense of stress even more.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)

POV control is clean, with no head-hopping, and interior access deepens at key beats. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, carrying subtext around power and cost without over-explaining. At times the diction risks purple, but it doesn’t slip out of Liora’s plausible narrative frame enough to damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and nicely textured with music/gear-specific perception that feels distinct to Jake. Sentence rhythm and diction modulate well between reflective exposition and on-page scene, and Lena’s dialogue has a different, lighter touch that marks her as a separate presence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and distinctively tinged with scientific curiosity and lyric perception (“clouds below shifted like a restless sea,” “touching distance”). Diction suits a thoughtful, empirically minded character without lapsing into jargon or academic stiffness, and psychic distance is well controlled. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the shifts between observation, thought, and action feel organic. The voice could claim even more individuality with a few more idiosyncratic turns of thought, but as-is it is more than strong enough for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, otherworldly setting; diction choices like “the sea breathed through the walls” and “cathedral of silver and shadow” establish a distinct texture. The narration balances concrete observation with gentle omniscient touches (e.g., about visitors after tomorrow disappeared) without breaking focalization in a jarring way. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the syntax supports the meditative pace. There is no dialogue to test, but the interior access and descriptive cadence read controlled and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)

Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic lines, especially around turning points like the hidden confession under the crown. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction suits a quietly reflective, competent protagonist. Occasionally the narration sounds slightly more poetically omniscient than character-bound, but not enough to damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Lena-filtered, with strong metaphor choices (ivy as fingers, bathroom walls as a ledger) that feel like her sensibility rather than authorial intrusion. Diction is elevated but controlled, matching a reflective, damaged intellectual artist type. The rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and sharper, declarative turns at key moments (“She wasn’t looking for forgiveness anymore.”). No POV slippage or explanatory overreach undermines the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical without being opaque, and clearly filtered through the dreamer’s sensibility as a “scholar of forgotten languages.” Diction choices like “propagation delays,” “cyclically reversed symbol,” and “unfolded with each step” feel deliberate and tonally unified. The modulation from cautious awe to quiet, earned confidence at the end (“The dreamer was no longer veiled”) reads controlled and intentional. There are no POV slips or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and tuned to Elara’s sensibility as a careful, idea-obsessed researcher. Imagery and diction (e.g., “perforated destiny,” “possibilities blooming like cracks in ice”) feel unified rather than stitched from disparate registers. Dialogue is sparse but efficient: the father’s single line economically conveys history and status dynamics. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions, though now and then the register edges toward authorial abstraction instead of staying fully inside Elara’s perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear preference for image-driven sentences and elevated diction that fit the mythic tone. POV is consistent and modest—there’s no head-hopping, and narrative certainty stays within what Liora can plausibly perceive. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling metronomic, and the line “beautician mortician” nicely encapsulates her dual identity in voice. A few formulations edge toward generic lyricism (“radiant hush,” “fractured dreams”), but overall the voice feels unified and deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility; images like the grotto as a bruise and vineyards as dark water give the piece a recognizable texture.

There’s minimal scaffolding or explanation; the narrative trusts image and cadence to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)

Diction fits a contemplative, seasoned observer and doesn’t drift into jarring registers. The perceptual signature—equating sound with roots, birds with historians, stone with memory—feels distinct and intentional. The voice could stretch a bit more under the story’s peak pressure, but it never slips or flattens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and controlled, with a slightly elevated, mythic register that suits the material. Diction choices like “lingering luminance,” “accommodate impossibilities,” and “when creativity got automated” give the narration a distinctive texture without breaking POV plausibility. Dialogue is sparse but functional and slightly uncanny where appropriate (the keystone’s command, the tattered figure’s lines), advancing theme and plot. The voice is competent and occasionally striking, though it stops short of being unmistakably individual.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the fable-like tone, with nice turns like “their glow seeping through the portholes like liquid gold.” Dialogue is lean and mostly natural, carrying subtext (she knows more than he does, the keys as emblems) without over-explaining. The narrative diction stays consistent and doesn’t drift into jarring registers. It’s a solid, confident voice, though not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)

Rhythm is varied and intentional, mixing long, sinuous sentences with sharper beats around key realizations and the static’s crescendo. There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble; the narrative distance stays intimate but slightly elevated, fitting a character who lives in abstractions. A few abstract formulations risk mild sameness, but overall the voice feels polished and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with an ancient, skeletal reaper—elevated but not implausibly academic for the figure we’re shown. Syntax and rhythm are varied and responsive to pressure; the narration glides between concrete image and interior abstraction without losing clarity. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how Elias notices light, dust, and bones, and the line “the weight of centuries pressing against his ribs like a forgotten hymn” epitomizes this. POV remains stable and well-handled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to light, texture, and sound/silence. Diction and syntax are elevated but feel appropriate to the mythic, end-of-world frame and do not drift into academic or mechanical registers. Psychic distance remains stable, sliding gently inward for interior stakes without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between slower, incantatory description and slightly tighter beats around the bell’s testing and the fish’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, observant, and gently lyrical, with strong control over distance and interior access. Diction and rhythm generally suit a reflective, solitary warden moving through a haunted landscape. Image choices (“bones of a forgotten song,” “mirrored hush of the night”) create a distinct texture without becoming incoherent. Occasionally, the narration leans into generalized thematic phrasing that feels more authorial than strictly character-bound, keeping this just shy of an elite, unmistakably singular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits an introspective alchemist in a numinous place (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “prismatic veil shimmering like liquid gemstones”). The narrative distance is well managed, blending her perceptions and reflections without jarring head-hops or stance shifts. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there is a distinct perceptual bias toward patterns and essences that feels character-specific. A few thematic lines slip into a more generic, essayistic register, but they don’t fundamentally break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and coherent, with a distinct lyric texture that matches Elias’s pattern-oriented mind. Diction like “midnight pattern seeker” and “soundless echo of his progress” feels motivated by his sensibility rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance remains consistent, and interior insights are woven smoothly into physical action. There is mild risk of over-eloquence relative to someone in acute danger, but the slightly elevated register seems intended as a reflective, slowed-time vantage rather than strict real-time panic.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a good balance of lyricism and clarity (“the duplicate’s silent scream trapped in glass”; “the numbness cracked, not vanishing, but shifting”). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and distinct—Veyra’s curt imperatives and aphoristic insights contrast with Kael’s vulnerable declarations. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the fight without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and aligned with a meticulous puzzle-designer’s sensibility. Diction remains controlled and avoids register whiplash, and the cadences modulate well between quiet reflection and tense beats. Limited dialogue is natural and functional, especially the courier’s clipped “They’re coming,” which sharpens the final turn. The voice could push slightly further into Lena’s particular mental idiom to be truly distinctive, but it is already polished and confident.

    The third-person focalization around Elias is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that fits his sensibility as a former conductor. Diction like “air itself had been macerated into silence” and “mournfully eager” feels deliberate and character-consistent, lending the prose a distinct texture without overreaching. Rhythm modulates well—longer, sonorous sentences for atmosphere; shorter ones at key turns (“Now, they listened.” “Now, that was enough.”). There is minimal dialogue, but the narrative voice carries subtext and mood convincingly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and distinct, blending quasi-technical diction (“interpreter,” “frequency”) with lyrical phrasing (“shard of hush,” “the universe remembering itself”) in a coherent register. POV is clean and modulates gracefully between external description and Mira’s conceptual shifts without head-hopping or clumsy exposition. The rhythmic control—sentences lengthening for atmosphere, tightening at the climax—serves the accumulative design. While some phrasings flirt with the ornate, they remain legible and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a cool, slightly analytical lyricism that fits a character who wants magic to be “measurable, predictable.” Syntax and diction are controlled and mostly smooth, with some pleasing rhythmic variation. At times, the register drifts toward abstract/philosophical phrasing that feels more authorial than deeply character-specific, especially around the explicit thematic statements. Still, POV is stable, free of head-hopping, and the modulation from gallery to void remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits the somber, speculative tone. Lirien’s perceptual bias—toward currents, pressure, tools, and trajectories—gives the voice a recognizable texture. Dialogue is clean but a bit on-the-nose, often stating theme rather than letting implication do the work (Tael’s objection and Lirien’s counters are very direct). There are no POV slips or register shocks, and rhythm modulates reasonably with scene intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a restrained, lyrical texture that suits the subject matter. Lena’s perceptual biases—attuning to sound, pulses, and the language of “voices”—are evident and coherent. Dialogue is concise and functional, with Elias’s static-rasp voice distinct enough from Lena’s steadier tone. The voice is polished and apt, though not yet so idiosyncratic as to feel singular at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)

The ghost’s static-voice and ink-writing method feel of a piece with the overall aesthetic and avoid jarring register shifts. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding between external and interior without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, each line of the ghost’s speech shifting meaning or pressure rather than filling space.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a perceptual signature rooted in texture, pattern, and scientific curiosity rather than mysticism. Diction and rhythm are controlled, leaning lyrical without sliding into opacity, and the POV does not leak or head-hop. The prose modulates gently as tension rises (e.g., as the diamond heats and the echoes “answer”), though the emotional register remains relatively calm throughout. Distinctive and publishable, if not yet singularly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with turns of phrase like “gravitationally playful” and “bitterness… was a kind of gravity” giving a distinct perceptual signature.

At times the voice drifts toward generalized abstraction, particularly when stating thematic insights, where a more character-specific idiom could sharpen distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and steady; it balances atmospheric description with clear action. Jace’s narrative idiom (e.g., thinking in terms of bureaucracy, relics, and erasure) feels distinct, and Mira’s dialogue is age-appropriate and brisk, giving her a different texture. POV control is tight with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is managed smoothly. The voice is stylish but never so ornate that it muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical texture and a clear perceptual bias toward craft, sound, and tactile detail. Rhythm and diction are controlled and mostly fitting for a quiet, magical-realist piece. The modulation from mournful hush to triumphant, invisible-crowd roar is smooth and legible. It doesn’t quite reach exceptional because the voice, while polished, feels familiar for this mode and doesn’t yet have a sharply idiosyncratic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical yet readable texture that fits Elias’s contemplative nature. Phrases like “equations rhymed with elegies and theorems bled into sonnets” feel like thoughts this particular narrator would have.

POV remains stable through the locksmith, with no leakage or unmotivated omniscience beyond the story’s chosen fable-like stance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with strong image choices (fractured reflection, shadow geometry) that feel character-appropriate. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, distinguishing Mira’s straightforward curiosity from Elara’s more guarded, metaphor-laden speech. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between sensory description and interior reflection without head-hopping or expositional over-explaining.

Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the diction suits both character and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, lush without collapsing into vagueness, and carries a distinct texture (“interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”) that suits the material. Diction is elevated but feels consistent with the story’s slightly mythic register and with Elias’s reflective mindset.

The voice is strong and particular, if not yet singular enough to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)

Phrasing like “driftingly alert” and “tinkersong of wonder” gives the prose a distinct texture without veering into incoherence. There are occasional familiar turns of phrase (“felt it in his bones”), but they don’t significantly flatten the voice. Dialogue is sparse yet natural, serving as pressure points rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility—he perceives the world in cloud types, ship hulls, and mechanical groans. Syntax varies well, with long, sinuous sentences in reflective passages and tighter phrases as he approaches the decision point. The diction (“skeletal remains,” “vessel of spooled wholeness”) is elevated but coherent with a solitary, sky-obsessed scientist-poet type, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The modulation from quiet observation to charged final poise is smooth and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and gently lyrical, with a clear fantastical sensibility. Diction (“driftwood nostalgia,” “captured sunlight”) fits the tone and world, and the narrative stance doesn’t head-hop or contradict itself. At times the voice leans on familiar speculative-poetic phrasing, blurring into a generic “fantasy vignette” register rather than something unmistakably character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly baroque lyricism that matches Lena’s intense, obsessive attention: phrases like “helix-minded precision” and “quaking reverie” feel of a piece. POV is stable, with no leakage into information she couldn’t plausibly sense; the canyon’s “approval” is clearly subjective perception, not omniscient statement. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and syntactic choices generally track emotional heightening. At times the diction leans a bit toward writerly flourish over character-rooted lexicon, which keeps it just shy of top-tier control.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive diction that marries the intellectual and the sensuous (“prism-minded,” “clandestinely luminous”).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is coherent and controlled, with a consistent sensory and metaphorical palette (silence, breath, tremors, weaving). Syntax varies enough to maintain rhythm, and the occasional elevated phrase (“avalanchingly quiet stillness”) feels stylistically deliberate rather than gratuitous. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the shadow-figure’s voice differentiates cleanly from Elias’s interiority. The voice is strong and polished, though not yet so idiosyncratic or surprising as to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)

Dialogue is clean and functional, with minor differentiation between the two Kaels (the scarred one rougher, more jaded) and no head-hopping or distance slips. Some phrasing leans toward familiar genre cadence, but the voice overall feels controlled and appropriate to the material. The elision of the final decision reads more like a structural choice than a POV failure, though it does limit emotional payoff.

The voice could perhaps admit a bit more roughness or idiosyncratic quirk to push it from strong to unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)

Overall, POV control is clean with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and textured, with a noir-tinged lyricism that feels consistent with Lena’s world and history. POV control is cleanly limited to her perceptions and knowledge, and shifts in psychic distance are smooth. Dialogue sounds natural for hardened smugglers—short, edged, and goal-driven—and Lena’s slightly more reflective register makes sense given her upbringing and current role. A few familiar constructions (“broken promises,” “key to something she couldn’t name”) brush common-phrase territory but don’t flatten the overall distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and convincing, with a perceptual signature that mixes empirical observation (“electrical impulses through the mycelial networks”) and lyric description (aurora as heartbeat). Dialogue is clean and functional, if slightly expository, and the storm-maker’s voice is distinct enough in its calm certainty and mythic phrasing. The narrative stance stays within what Elara can plausibly infer, and psychic distance is well controlled. There’s room for more idiosyncrasy or subtext in the exchanges, but the voice is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through an artist’s sensibility, with attention to light, texture, and form. Diction and rhythm support the uncanny, solemn mood without major register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—moody, sensory, slightly formal—that fits both Liora’s craft and the city’s ruin: “sky the color of old bruises,” “shimmer like captured sunlight.” POV control is clean and stable, with interiority and description filtered consistently through Liora’s sensibility. Rhythm and diction modulate smoothly between atmospheric description and procedural action (reconstructing the map, navigating the archives). There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance feels confident and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and distinctly tuned to Elias’s sensibility: attentive to vibration, color, and small mechanical balances. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between descriptive reverie and simple physical action without wobbling in register. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; even reflective lines are plausibly rooted in his worldview and history. The lyricism is strong, though it mostly maintains a single hushed register rather than flexing more radically under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and convincingly filtered through an android’s sensibility (technical terms alongside sensory metaphors). Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure—more expansive in reflection, tighter around the burning sequence. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence feels high. A few metaphors lean toward writerly flourish rather than character-specific perception, but they don’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable, with a consistent reflective yet concrete narrative voice. Phrasing like “she *listened*, not just with her ears” and the attention to small sounds and textures create a recognizable perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but believable and efficient, fitting each character’s role and age. At times the narration leans into familiar lyrical modes (“the courtyard held its breath”), but the register remains coherent and well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature centered on touch, vibration, and coded thinking. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, supporting the mysterious, submerged tone without sacrificing clarity.

The lyricism stays character-anchored rather than feeling like abstract authorial ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically textured yet grounded in Marlowe’s sensibility, with consistent diction and a controlled, musical rhythm. Perception is filtered through his habits and history (reading grounds, associating salt with both work and the chambers), giving the narration a distinct signature. Psychic distance is well-managed, tightening around key beats without slipping into authorial exposition. The voice holds steady to closure, modulating intensity via syntax and image rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “cartographer of the unseen” and “terrestrially cosmic hum.” POV control is solid; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction fits a contemplative mystic.

Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person focalization through Elara is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature (attention to objects, language, and ritual). Prose rhythm modulates well between lyric description and grounded dialogue, and Mira’s speech patterns are distinct enough to differentiate her. Dialogue carries subtext—Mira’s “borrowing” as pretext, questions as gentle interrogation—without sounding written or expository. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and elision around Veyra’s past feels purposeful rather than coy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical texture (“tragically radiant, like sunlight through stained glass”) that suits the speculative-emotional register. POV boundaries are clean, and the prose modulates appropriately between description and interiority without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough and functions as action (Liora’s explanations and invitation move the plot and crystallize stakes). Occasionally the diction leans slightly abstract or high-register (“translate his isolation into independence”), but it remains within a plausible narrative voice and doesn’t disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and controlled, with lyrical touches (“smooth as poisoned honey,” “pearl twilight”) that feel intentional rather than random. POV remains anchored in Lian’s experience, and while the narration occasionally edges toward a more omniscient tone, it does not break coherence. Dialogue is functional and generally clear in status dynamics, though some lines (“Truth is what I say it is. That’s the privilege of power.”) feel a bit on-the-nose and writerly rather than fully natural. Rhythm is varied and capable of slowing for reflection without losing track of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and acoustically aware, with diction and metaphor consistently oriented around sound and resonance. Veyan’s brief dialogue has its own timbre (“reed-blown melancholy”) while remaining consonant with the overall tone. A couple of phrases (“through progressive disclosure”) feel more meta-technical than organic to the voice, slightly thinning the otherwise strong stylistic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with phrases like “salvager of echoes” and “borrowed starlight” giving it a memorable timbre. POV distance is well controlled; we stay in Mara’s perceptions and lexicon without intrusive authorial explanation. The sparse dialogue (with the red-coated woman) is clean and charged with subtext, advancing theme and closure. A few explanatory sentences in the middle lean more into telling than the surrounding lyricism, but they don’t significantly disrupt voice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not opaque third-person that suits Ren’s contemplative nature and the quiet scene. Diction (“demure audacity,” “scintillatingly somber”) tilts elevated but feels intentional rather than out of character for the narrative stance. Dialogue is clean, natural, and lightly freighted with subtext, especially around their mutual watching and the invitation to stay. The POV remains stable and focused on Ren’s perceptions without stray omniscient leakage that breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and controlled, with some textured phrasing (“the myth was a diamond—flawed”) that suits a methodical investigator. POV boundaries are respected; we never slip out of Elias’s lens, and the narration’s confidence matches what he can plausibly infer. Dialogue is clear and functional but lacks strong individuating rhythm or subtext—the stranger’s lines, in particular, feel generic for the situation. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent rather than distinctly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, matching the cosmic-gothic setting and Elias’s grandiosity. Diction and rhythm feel controlled (“lightning splitting the sky like a blade”), with metaphor deployed thoughtfully rather than by rote.

Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the girl’s simple, direct speech contrasts effectively with Elias’s more reflective narration. POV boundaries are clean; we don’t slip into anyone else’s interiority. A few phrases feel slightly familiar (“heart too full of things that didn’t sell”), but overall the voice has a distinct, coherent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a good perceptual signature around sound and mechanical detail (“brass dials,” “resonator,” “frequency”). Prose modulation under stress works: the rhythm tightens around action, then softens into a more reflective cadence at closure.

There are no POV slips or unexplained knowledge jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistently filtered through Elias, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The prose is controlled and clear, with a mildly elevated thriller-tinged register that fits the material. However, the narrative voice lacks a strongly distinctive texture or idiolect; lines like “his heart pounding” and “cutting through the gloom like a scalpel” feel generic rather than uniquely Elias. Dialogue is sparse and functional, especially Voss’s, which leans into stock-villain exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)

    The third-person voice is confident and textured, with strong rhythmic control and a distinct, slightly wry lyricism (“fools ring bells,” “acid sea below licked at its rusted underbelly”). POV remains stable through Elias, and the narrator’s elevated diction broadly fits the mythic-tinged setting. A few phrases (“steadily curious defiance,” “throughout the evolution of his life”) feel more like prompt grafts than organic voice, briefly thinning the illusion. Dialogue is lean, tonal, and character-distinguishing, effectively advancing pressure and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a calm, slightly noir-tech register that fits Lena’s analytical role.

The narrative distance stays stable and appropriate; we’re clearly inside Lena’s perspective without POV leakage or intrusive authorial commentary. While the voice isn’t strikingly idiosyncratic, it is controlled and never distracts from the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the fable-like fantasy frame, with some strong rhythmic sentences and imagistic choices. POV control is consistent; we remain in Elias’s orbit without unmotivated distance shifts, and the brief dialogue lines feel natural enough. There are occasional register bumps (“calmly intuitive,” “map empathy onto action”) that read more abstract or conceptual than this character’s lived lexicon. Overall the voice is distinctive and controlled, but a touch self-conscious in places.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical but controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elias notices sound and texture. Dialogue is sparse yet natural and goal-driven, especially the woman’s pointed line about where “the sound of endings” truly resides. The rhythmic modulation—from long, flowing descriptive sentences to tighter, direct exchanges—supports emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensory, and lyrically controlled, with a distinct way of noticing (peripheral, vibration-focused, half-masked seeing). The telepathic dialogue is handled cleanly and fits the established tone without jarring shifts in register. Rhythms vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the diction feels unified—elevated but apt for this mythic, contemplative mode. The prophet’s voice is slightly generic but still serviceable given his archetypal role.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person narration is stable and technically controlled, with a consistent contemplative tone and no POV slippage. The voice has a gentle, elegiac texture suited to the material, but it lacks distinctive verbal idiosyncrasy or sharp edges that would make it unmistakably Elias’s perception rather than generalized literary diction. Some phrasing trends toward workshop-typical sentiment (“quiet satisfaction,” “exactly where he was meant to be”) rather than character-specific language. Overall, it’s competent and smooth but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and sensibly elevated for an erudite scholar; diction (“sonically reflective,” “fractured sequences”) feels motivated by his mind. The perceptual signature—attunement to sound, silence, and fine sensory gradations—is consistent throughout and carries much of the piece’s distinctiveness. There’s no dialogue to test, but interior focus and external description balance well. Some sentences lean toward the lyric-general, yet rhythm and clarity remain strong under the mild pressure the story actually generates.

Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status and history in a few lines, especially the woman’s resigned “You always forget, but I remember for you.” The narrative distance stays consistent, with brief reflective summaries anchored in concrete stimuli (fog, tapes, chalk). A few elevated turns of phrase skate close to “literary register” rather than fully idiosyncratic voice, but they remain controlled and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical register that matches the character’s contemplative, technical mind and the story’s cosmic ambitions.

The perceptual signature—attention to texture, weight, and sound—fits a character obsessed with the shapes of burdens. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the prose modulates gently at the end to admit a note of uplift without breaking tone.

There are occasional register bumps where scientific phrasing (“synaptic plasticity”) clashes slightly with the otherwise organic tone, but these don’t break POV control. Overall, the narrative stance is confident and controlled, if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits this lightly speculative world (“a secret begging to be kept,” “like dying stars”). Dialogue sounds natural and distinct—Maren’s clipped directives versus Elias’s more tentative responses—while still carrying subtext about status and expertise. The narrative occasionally risks purple, but most images pull double duty for mood and meaning rather than decorative flourish. POV is stable and free of leakage, and the prose modulates effectively between descriptive stillness and forward-moving action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is distinctive and controlled, with metaphors like “streetlights daydreamed” and the shard as a “shard of hush” creating a recognizable sonic and imagistic signature. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a careful, haunted observer, and the lyricism never fully drifts into self-indulgent opacity. Psychic distance is well managed, comfortably close to Elias without omniscient leakage. The modulation from observational calm to tense stillness around the house’s pause is handled with subtle, confident shifts in cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a clear focalization through the diver and a consistent handling of the statue’s telepathic speech. Diction and rhythm match the eerie, submerged atmosphere without drifting into purple overload, and psychic distance stays coherent. The prose modulates effectively between descriptive stillness and sharper, more declarative lines in moments of realization. The main limitation is that the narrative voice, while polished, feels more generally “literary” than sharply particular to this diver as an observing consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with some memorable turns (“carried hope like a bruise,” “if regret had a smell”) and an even, contemplative cadence suiting the piece’s philosophical bent. Diction matches a thoughtful, mathematically inclined protagonist without sliding into jargon. There’s a mild explanatory tendency in articulating theories and stakes, but it doesn’t break immersion. Overall the voice feels controlled and unified, if not yet singularly distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent imagery around smog, glass, moonlight, and ink that feels particular to this painter. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with long, textured sentences balanced by shorter, declarative ones at emotional pivot points (“The painter didn’t care about the words.” / “She wasn’t tired. Not anymore.”). The perceptual bias—how she notices textures, tools, and light—is strong and coherent, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift. It’s accomplished, though a hair more modulation between lyricism and rawness under emotional stress could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct texture—lyric but grounded, with images like “voice like aged parchment” and “rosewater dread” that feel specific rather than generic. POV remains stable through Liora, and the narrative’s sensory priorities (history, texture, ritual) clearly reflect her mind. Dialogue is spare but natural and subtextual, particularly the baker’s withheld answer and conditional “Shape it right, and maybe the bees will come back.” Occasional heightened diction edges toward the ornate, but the rhythm and register remain controlled and coherent with the character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with striking phrases like “black teeth of the island” and “the color of old bruises” that feel organic to the piece’s sensibility. The narrative distance stays steady—inside Elias’s perceptions without omniscient leakage—while maintaining a slightly stylized diction that suits the fable-like tone. Rhythm varies well between long, atmospheric lines and tighter, event-focused sentences at key turns. The voice is distinctive and controlled enough for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically gothic yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual filter through Elias (“whispering advisor trailed like a draft,” “lingering luminance”). The advisor’s speech has a distinct cadence, and the italicized lines function as both dialogue and thematic counterpoint. Narrative distance is steady, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few maxim-like lines risk reading as authorial rather than purely character-driven, but they don’t materially disrupt the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensuous, and well-matched to the character’s tactile, auditory focus; diction like “bones of the world” and “fractaled paths” feels coherent with his prophetic-musician lens. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely as the performance intensifies, without slipping into opacity. It’s a distinctive, confident narrative voice, even if it doesn’t quite push into formally daring territory.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and quietly lyrical, with good modulation between descriptive and high-pressure moments. Diction (e.g., “sunwashed dread,” “salt-scented air,” “language of silence”) feels cohesive to a contemplative, pattern-attuned cartographer and avoids register clashes. There’s no head-hopping or artificial withholding; information is revealed in step with what Mira can perceive. The voice could risk a slightly more idiosyncratic perceptual bias to distinguish her further from a generalized fantasy narrator, but it’s already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a measured, mildly academic diction that fits a historian protagonist. Dialogue is natural, moves the conflict forward, and the two speakers are distinguishable in stance and rhythm. Occasional analytic phrases (“emotionally rational”) skirt abstraction but mostly feel character-appropriate rather than intrusive. Point of view remains stable and reliable, with clean handling of reflection inside a present-tense scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without being opaque, and clearly aligned with Elias’s sensibility and professional eye. Syntax and rhythm vary nicely, with longer, meditative sentences balanced by shorter emphatic ones (“Now, only the river remembered.”). Metaphors (the river “remembering,” the pavilion’s collapse as a “sigh held too long”) feel of a piece and give the voice a distinct texture. The register occasionally edges toward essayistic (“archeologist of abandoned dreams,” “wrestle against oblivion”), but it still fits the elevated, reflective tone of the piece and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and mostly well controlled, with a measured, contemplative narrative voice that suits Elias’s temperament. Diction like “logical page indexer” and “alternative hypothesis” coheres with his methodical mindset, and the prose modulates slightly as his pulse quickens. There are minor awkward constructions (“moved tranquilly perceptive”) that feel more like stylistic slips than intentional voice. Overall, the voice is distinct and apt, if not especially daring.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that fits Veyra’s craft-oriented, melancholic perspective. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the imagery (“shadow peeled away like dead skin,” “dreams…like liquid silver”) gives the prose a distinct texture. There is no head-hopping; narrative certainty stays within what Veyra can infer or believe. The voice holds under pressure in the final paragraph without sliding into abstraction or meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, lyrical texture that fits Lena’s haunted, obsessive mindset. Diction and rhythm are consistent—leans elevated but not implausibly so for the perspective, and the imagery tends to be coherent (“the sky split open,” “like heat off pavement”). Limited dialogue is sharp and purposeful, particularly the single command “Show me,” which carries subtext and intent. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is steady and tight enough to maintain urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistent, with a strong visual and sonic texture (“choir of voices,” “language written in light”) that matches the speculative observatory frame. Third-person focus stays centered on Elias while still allowing the pilgrim’s presence and idiom to register distinctly through dialogue. Dialogue is economical and character-revealing, particularly the “not decode… Reveal” exchange. Rhythm and diction mostly avoid strain while maintaining a poetic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Elias’s sensibility—metaphoric but not academic, regretful yet unsentimental. Phrasings like “guilt was a sieve through which every breath passed” and “the watch still ticked, just not for him” feel particular rather than generic. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying history and regret beneath the declarative lines. Psychic distance remains steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly lyrical texture that fits Elias’s reflective temperament. Sentence rhythm is varied and generally well-tuned to the quiet, tense atmosphere; there are no POV slips or unmotivated distance shifts. Dialogue is spare but natural, and Seris’s small correction (“Thoughtful,” she corrected) gives her a distinct, if minimal, tonal signature. A few lines verge on polished “wisdom quote” territory, but overall the voice feels unified and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits an ex-academic stargazer mired in introspection. Images like “eyes that had once mapped stars instead of shorelines” and “the tide lapping merrily melancholic” give the narration a distinct texture. Psychic distance stays coherent, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the diction veers into generalized, thesis-like phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a noir-tinged, slightly lyrical texture that suits Elias's jaded worldview. Metaphors like "last embers of a dying star" and "like a blade forged to bend but never break" give the prose a distinct flavor without overwhelming clarity. Dialogue is clean and mostly natural, though sometimes leans into convenient exposition (Mara explaining the "rules"). Overall, POV control is solid and the narrative stance feels unified and appropriate to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture grounded in sensory detail, particularly smell and touch, which feels distinctive to Liora. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with his ember-crackle voice aligning with his liminal state and advancing the emotional stakes. Narrative distance stays steady and appropriate; there's no head-hopping or register jolt. While the voice is strong, it doesn’t yet have the unmistakable idiosyncrasy that would make it singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends cartomantic imagery and familial ritual. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, flowing sentences in reflection and slightly sharper beats at key tactile moments (tracing the crack, aligning the hand). There’s minimal register drift; even elevated diction feels consonant with a character whose work is symbolic interpretation. At times, the narrative stance comes close to essayistic abstraction, but it never fully detaches from her embodied present.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material—there’s a quiet, assured cadence that supports the “ghostly resolve” tone. Diction (“floating reliquary of human regret,” “liquid starlight”) is elevated but coherent with a mythic-sf frame, and the few lines of interior speech sound natural within the stylized register. Psychic distance stays consistent: we are close enough to feel her answers to the accusations without drifting into omniscient commentary. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that undercut the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, slightly lyrical, and generally well-matched to the material; Elias’s perceptions color the world consistently. Dialogue is economical, moves the plot, and distinguishes the woman’s prophetic certainty from his reluctance. Some narrative sentences slip into abstract or generalized phrasing (“world that had forgotten how to shine,” “coincidences felt less like chance and more like fate”) that sound more like authorial theme than character-tinted perception. Overall, though, psychic distance and tense stay clean, with only mild moments of generic register.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature—practical, observant, tinged with wry restraint (“a winking hush of a thing”). Syntax and rhythm vary well, with lyric touches that largely stay in character and support mood. There’s no head-hopping or tense drift, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what’s already dramatized. While the voice is strong and apt, it stops short of the singular idiosyncrasy that would push it into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the material (“half-remembered dream,” “living shadows,” “sacred patterns”). Diction and syntax are consistent and confident, with no POV slips and minimal explanatory scaffolding. A few phrases lean on familiar formulations (“weight in his chest,” “debt unpaid”), but most images feel particular to Elias’s world and vocation. Overall the narrative stance is distinctive and polished enough for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a consistent lyric register that plausibly fits a poet protagonist (“seconds stretching like scars across skin,” “storm-kissed wonder”). POV is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; time and emotional distance are modulated cleanly as the storm intensifies. Diction is elevated but not in a way that feels alien to Elias’s mind, and metaphoric thinking clearly comes from his perspective. A few phrases skirt the edge of overwrought, but they don’t break voice coherence or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third on Elias is steady and coherent, with a mildly elevated, precise diction that suits a “dueling philosopher.” Dialogue generally feels purposeful and carries subtext—Isolde’s “You’re not just a philosopher…You’re a cartographer” encapsulates both rivalry and recognition. Voices are somewhat stylized but distinct enough, with her sharper, more needling tone contrasting his measured rhetoric. There are no POV slips or helpfully over-explanatory intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with nice turns like “the rusted library’s skeletal ribs” and “poets didn’t molt personalities monthly.” Diction sits plausibly within Lumen’s implied intelligence and history; it’s lyrical without slipping into alien register. Dialogue is spare but effective, carrying character and subtext (Elias’s “Then you’re a liar” neatly reframes Lumen). The modulation from reflective past to active present is smooth and never confuses focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-inflected, with metaphors rooted in Elias’s world of tides, ships, film, and music. Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely—calmer, expansive lines for setup; sharper phrasing and shorter sentences as he approaches and executes the encore. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain interiority, trusting images and choices to carry subtext. The voice feels unified and confident without sliding into generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and marked by a distinct sensory-luminous texture that suits the world (“blossoms that pulsed like slow heartbeats,” glyphs shifting with angle). POV boundaries are clean; we never slip outside Liora’s knowledge, and the limited dialogue sounds natural and purposeful. Rhythm varies well between descriptive cadences and briefer, pressure-toned lines. The register edges toward the lyrical-general at a few moments, but never enough to disrupt coherence or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady, measured, and aligned with a slow-spoken, contemplative protagonist; diction and rhythm feel intentionally unhurried without being stodgy. Lyric touches (“tides of remembrance,” “color of unspoken apologies”) are consistent with the world’s soft magic rather than jarringly ornate. Psychic distance is controlled, sliding in and out of interior insight smoothly with no head-hopping. Very occasional abstract statements creep in, but they don’t fracture the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, leaning heavily on expository summarization of the protagonist's mindset. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation that would differentiate Elara's specific scientific gaze from a generic observer, resulting in a competent but unmemorable delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, successfully maintaining a somber, reflective tone. However, it occasionally relies on clichés ("scars on her wrists," "voice rough as gravel") that flatten the specific texture of the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("delicate, silent symphonies"). Descriptions like "eyes like polished obsidian" rely on familiar clichés that flatten the specific texture of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, though it occasionally relies on standard phrasing ("settled in his chest like a stone"). The "gift" of occupying impossible spaces feels like an authorial intrusion to bypass plot logic rather than an organic character voice element.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like dignity, fitting the "community legend" mode. However, the psychic distance is quite high, keeping the reader observing Liora from afar rather than inhabiting her visceral experience of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for a fable. However, it occasionally slips into "as-you-know" exposition ("that’s what the old texts called...") that distances the reader from the immediate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a cohesive, slightly melancholic tone appropriate for the subject. The shift into clinical phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped") disrupts the otherwise lyrical texture of the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, with clear focus. However, it leans on familiar genre phrasing ("skeletal silence," "voice low") that keeps the prose functional but indistinguishable from standard YA dystopian fare.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, filtering all description through the protagonist's synesthetic lens ("bruised purples," "sickly greens"). The control of psychic distance is excellent, moving smoothly from the physical ruins to deep interiority without jarring shifts. The prose maintains a lyrical consistency that suits the subject matter perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, frequently using "helpful narrator" tactics to label emotions ("luminous disbelief") rather than dramatizing them. The tone dictates how the reader should feel rather than earning the emotional response.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans into standard "literary" abstraction. The narration often tells the reader what to feel ("artistry... felt hollow") instead of creating the feeling through voice-driven texture.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on melodramatic phrasing and stock dialogue ("You shouldn't be here," "Neither should you"). The tone feels performative, with emotional beats signaled by clichés rather than authentic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but monotone, overly reliant on a hushed, reverent tone that distances the reader. The pervasive use of a single rhetorical structure ("not X, but Y") flattens the POV into a rhythmic drone.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reflective, fitting the "mundane mysticism" tone. It effectively balances the mechanical nature of the protagonist with the lyrical subject matter, though it occasionally slips into standard sci-fi phrasing ("primary directive," "emergent consciousness").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is stable and functional, filtering the scene effectively through Mira's perspective. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("Mira saw the truth") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like tone that suits the magical realism elements. The POV remains firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his specific experiences as a vine dresser. The tone modulates well between the melancholy of decay and the wonder of the new growth.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally veers into melodrama ("hush so profound... universe holding its breath"). The perspective stays firmly with Elara, managing technical details and internal wonder effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on standard atmospheric tropes ("shattered mirror," "holding its breath"); the perspective offers little distinct interiority beyond functional observation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent melancholic and lyrical tone that suits the oracle persona. The narration effectively filters the world through Elias's burden, though it occasionally dips into melodrama ("auroral sorrow") that distracts from the character's grounded struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending industrial grit with a touch of the surreal. The shift to the "psychic's advice" recollection is distinct and serves the character's internal logic without breaking POV. The narrative distance is well-controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and polished, suiting the meditative tone. There is a slight tendency toward &quot;writerly&quot; detachment that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience, but the perceptual signature remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into a sentimental, "warm bath" tone that lacks distinct texture or edge. Dialogue is functional but unrealistic for the characters, particularly the eight-year-old speaking with adult wisdom ("The name settled... like a promise").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the genre. However, it relies heavily on "as if" and "like" constructions to convey interiority (filtering), which distances the reader and creates a repetitive cadence that softens the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is consistent but leans heavily on expository dialogue to manage plot points in the final third. The distinctiveness of the characters is muted by their shared function as vessels for backstory rather than individuals with clashing idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but falters at forced prompt insertions, particularly the misuse of "rhetorical devices." The tone fits the ritualistic content, though it occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from filtering ("She remembered," "She had come") that distances the reader. The tone effectively matches the "upturned hush" requirement, though it leans toward melodrama ("perfect illusion of infinity").

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is functional but generic, leaning on standard fantasy register without a distinct perceptual grain. It occasionally slips into melodrama ("sound like breaking glass") that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.7)
    The point of view head-hops between Elias and Mira within the short span, diluting intimacy and narrative focus. The voice leans into melodrama ("scream into the void," "pluck the silence"), which creates a distance that prevents deep engagement with the characters' immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a measured, atmospheric tone that suits the protagonist's meticulous nature. The point of view remains stable, filtering the world clearly through Elias's observant, if somewhat detached, perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and moody, maintaining a stable POV throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("unravel a man") that feels slightly detached from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans heavily on familiar metaphors ("peeled back... like an onion," "bent like reeds") that dampen the intended lyricism. The tone struggles to balance the high-fantasy concepts with the required subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it relies occasionally on distant filtering ("She had heard the stories") rather than immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice aims for a lyrical tone but stumbles into melodrama and error ("the way it subsume the air"—a subject-verb agreement failure). The heavy use of filter verbs ("she saw the way," "let herself imagine") creates unnecessary distance from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is functional but tends towards over-explaining internal states ("curiosity pricked," "instincts humming") rather than trusting the action. Dialogue is serviceable but leans on stock phrasing ("Depends on who’s asking") that lacks individual character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. However, the POV distance is quite close without being deeply interior; we get descriptions of Liora's feelings ("luminescent ache") rather than the raw texture of her thoughts during the moment of hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally relies on standard fantasy register ("slithered," "sentinels"). The narrative distance is stable, but interiority sometimes falls into rhetorical cliché ("believed—no, she *knew*").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but leans on familiar similes ("like fireflies," "like sunlight through stained glass"). The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally slips into explanatory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the setting. However, the interiority occasionally slips into generic phrasing ("sent a jolt through him") rather than maintaining a unique perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, but occasionally over-explains significance ("It was too perfect, too deliberate"). The tone balances the mundane and the magical well, though the filter of Mara's perceptions sometimes feels a bit too composed for the strangeness she is witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama. The dialogue feels stagey and functional ("A key. Or a lock."), lacking the naturalism and distinct texture of the descriptive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lyrical voice suits the fable-like mode and shifts effectively from wonder to horror. The narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though internal monologue occasionally slips into expository explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and competent, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, it leans into standard fantasy narration without a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the prose beyond functional storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is stable and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a consistent tone of mystery. However, it leans on dramatic filtering ("he dared to kneel") and summary of traits ("analytically artistic") rather than trusting the dramatization to convey the character's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narration is heavily filtered through the protagonist's realizations ("He realized," "he understood," "he saw now"), which creates unnecessary psychic distance. The voice leans into melodramatic abstraction ("something like time itself") rather than establishing a sharp, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from melodramatic affectation ("echoes fading into the silence of eternity"). The dialogue is functional but standard genre banter ("You don’t know what you’re doing"), lacking distinct idiolect or subtextual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent close third-person distance. The internal monologue blends seamlessly with action. Some phrasing leans slightly into genre-standard "workshop voice" (e.g., "equations he almost recognized"), but the overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered, relying heavily on "He [verb]" constructions and "He had always" exposition that creates distance. The tone drifts into purple prose that prioritizes sounding poetic over clarity of perception. The POV does not feel distinct or lived-in, but rather like a standard "literary narrator" voice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately moody, maintaining a close third-person filter. There is a slight tendency toward &quot;writerly&quot; phrasing that distances the reader from raw experience, but the tone generally supports the surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally leans into overwrought descriptors ("clung... like a forgotten thought"). POV is stable, but the internal monologue often serves to bridge plot gaps rather than explore character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining Lan's nature and the world's meaning instead of letting actions speak. The tone is consistent, but the distance prevents deep immersion in Lan's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, establishing a cohesive mood. However, it tends toward romantic abstraction ("symphony no one would ever hear"), which creates a layer of distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.0)
    The point of view violates its own constraints. While firmly anchored in Elias’s perspective, the narrative describes visuals he cannot perceive ("wings catching the light like stained glass," "ripples bent the glow"). These filter violations disrupt the reader's immersion in his blindness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone throughout. However, the narration occasionally over-explains the protagonist's internal state ("she was chasing the singular convergence") instead of trusting the scene to convey her intent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    The mythic, detached voice is consistent and suits the fable-like quality of the story. Yet, it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("patina of a thousand forgotten chimes") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a somber and slightly lyrical tone throughout. The close third-person POV is stable, though it occasionally drifts into generic "literary" registers ("loneliness gnawed at her ribs") rather than distinct character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending gothic and mythic tones effectively. The control over the protagonist's perspective is steady, though occasionally the voice prioritizes poetic rhythm over immediate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    The gothic voice is generally consistent but is shattered by the phrase "ephemeral cameo appearances," a cinematic/modern register that clashes violently with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, matching the "poetic weaver" persona, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("secrets thickening like syrup"). The POV remains stable, filtering the world through a consistent, if slightly overwritten, lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, slightly mythic tone appropriate for the genre. Interiority is well-managed within the single POV, though the register occasionally drifts into somewhat standard fantasy phrasing without a distinct, idiosyncratic texture to distinguish it further.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and moody, fitting the noir-adjacent tone. However, the POV lapses into melodramatic filtering ("felt its pull," "weight of anticipation") that tells the reader how to feel rather than showing the emotion through action. The mother's arrival is framed through a standard thriller lens ("shadow moved," "tall, familiar") that feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is competent but distant, frequently slipping into omniscient summary during key moments. There is a lack of distinct perceptual texture; the prose reports events rather than immersing the reader in Liora's immediate experience. The shift from Liora's perspective to broad historical judgment at the end weakens the POV intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a magic realism piece. However, it relies on some "workshop lyrical" habits, such as "voice like the rustle of leaves" and "warm as a heartbeat," which softens the distinctiveness of the POV. The tone matches the content but lacks a sharp, unique edge.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly "writerly," prioritizing lyrical flourish over narrative precision. The drug-induced haze is handled well technically but distances the reader from the stakes, wrapping the scene in a cotton-wool filter that dampens urgency. The POV remains stable, though the shift to shared magical telepathy is sudden.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a poetic register, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought imagery ("breath curling like smoke," "world burned itself into them"). The POV remains stable, but the lack of distinct idiom in the final dialogue makes the characters sound generic.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent register that suits the magical realism tone. The integration of technical terms like "parabolic dishes" and "hobo nickel" feels natural within the POV's lexicon, enhancing the story's specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but occasionally slips into omniscient summarization ("known in certain circles") that distances the reader from the POV. The tone wavers between atmospheric tension and slightly pulpy adventure tropes ("bet with the universe").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the "poet" persona. There is a distinct texture to the narration. However, it occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("whisper that could part the ocean") that feels performative, distancing the reader from the raw reality of the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the magical realism tone. However, the reliance on poetic phrasing occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action, prioritizing atmosphere over urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and appropriate for the genre. The narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("syllable a promise to the past").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is competent but leans into sentimental labels ("slyly heartfelt," "dried tears") that tell the reader how to feel. The narrative distance is consistent, but the filtering of emotion is often generic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the close third-person POV well. The tone occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again"), which feels like a forced insertion of a prompt phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, suiting the surreal setting. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing ("fractured hush," "broken promises") that draws attention to the prose itself, but the tone remains stable and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice is functional but marred by filter verbs ("he felt," "Liora's eyes widened") and a standard fantasy register that creates distance. The perspective lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on generic observations rather than character-specific notice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to melodrama and poetic abstraction (&quot;quiet song of light&quot;). Heavy use of explanatory interiority filters the experience, creating distance between the reader and the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, effectively establishing the "liminal" mood. However, the integration of specific prompt phrases (e.g., "lightly attentive") occasionally disrupts the natural cadence of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dialogue leans heavily into stylized, high-concept declarations ("I want the sea written into me") that feel artificial. The narrative voice is distinct but occasionally overly dense with metaphorical ornamentation that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose demonstrates a consistent, if slightly overwrought, voice suitable for a fable, though it leans on standard fantasy phrasing. The POV is stable, but the internal monologue often drifts into explanation rather than embodied perception. The dialogue functions primarily as exposition, lacking distinct character idioms or subtextual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but drifts into melodramatic filtering ("universe itself was holding its breath"). The tone borders on purple prose, which distances the reader from the grounded reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.3)
    A high density of filter verbs ("she thought," "she wondered," "she saw," "she decided") creates unnecessary psychic distance. The voice leans into "writerly" abstraction rather than immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic ("hinges groaning like a waking beast"); the narrative distance feels filtered through genre conventions rather than a distinct, grounded character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lyrical voice is consistent, establishing a distinct mood, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("breath held too long"). The dialogue is the weakest element, reading as functional stagecraft rather than the natural speech of two distinct characters.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, stagey phrasing ("turning theory into flesh," "operatively gentle"). Dialogue feels performative and rhetorical, lacking the jagged, natural rhythm of two weary veterans negotiating a truce.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, maintaining a "fractured grace" tone that suits the subject matter. It creates a cohesive mood, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("ghost of a song," "promise of rain that never came").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily reliant on elevated, "purple" diction that creates distance. The tone remains melodramatic throughout ("fragile eternity," "whispered song") without modulating for the changing pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, relying on summary to convey Liora's intent and history. The descriptor "urbane" clashes slightly with the solitary, rugged setting without enough behavioral evidence to support it. The POV distance remains safe, filtering the experience through interpretation rather than immediate sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but occasionally overwrought ("blushing stillness"), leaning into a "precious" tone that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent in its reverent, high-fantasy tone but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard "mythic" cadences. The prose occasionally drifts into sentimental register ("chorus of the lost," "braids of time") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but tends toward purple prose ("fissure a map of time’s slow unraveling"). The tone is cohesive, though it struggles to integrate the "precisely playful" prompt requirement naturally, resulting in a slight stumble in narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and suitably atmospheric, maintaining a mythic quality that suits the setting. However, the intrusion of modern, academic phrasing ("empirically ironic," "schematic representations") momentarily disrupts the immersive historical tone, creating a slight distance in the otherwise intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on abstract summaries of emotion ("contradiction that gnawed," "storm inside her") instead of embodied experience. The POV remains stable, though the dialogue leans into expository declarations of internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical fable quality that suits the material, though it occasionally distances the reader. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("realized," "understood") to convey internal states that would be stronger if shown through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "mender" archetype well. However, it leans on filter verbs ("Liora knew," "she thought") and explicit interpretation of feelings rather than letting subtext carry the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical tone appropriate for the setting. However, it leans on abstract telling ("whisper of something forgotten") and labels emotions ("unsettled," "awe") rather than evoking them through distinct perceptual signatures.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but relies on overwrought metaphors ("pressing against her ribs like a second heartbeat") that strain credibility. The forced insertion of prompt phrases, particularly the awkward "carefully resourceful heart," disrupts the narrative flow and character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a melancholic, surreal tone. However, the specific phrasing "Through narrative threads" slips out of the established POV into a meta-narrative register that feels like an intrusion of the author's outline.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for a fable-like fantasy, maintaining a steady, somewhat formal tone. The POV is stable on Liora. It successfully evokes a sense of mystery, though it occasionally tells the reader what to feel ("stories of people who vanished without explanation") rather than dramatizing the gap in history purely through the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriate for the mythic tone. Narrative distance is stable, though the prose texture remains somewhat uniform without distinct peaks in intensity or specific perceptual idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is generally atmospheric but stumbles on awkward phrasing like "Retrocognitively blessed," which reads as clinical exposition in a mythic tone. The shift from the "hush" of the prism to the visual climax feels slightly disjointed in the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "summer-quill" voice is consistent and atmospheric. It supports the dream-logic of the piece effectively, though it risks breathless solemnity at times.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("spun it into the air like a question"). The narrative distance is stable, but the reliance on abstract emotional summaries distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reflective for the character. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("Liora understood, suddenly") and summary narration ("Liora didn't believe in omens") that creates distance at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and strictly focalized through Liora’s sensory experience. The prose maintains a consistent texture ("frayed edges," "starched air") that supports the atmospheric tone. Dialogue is sparse but carries distinct subtextual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, effectively establishing a mood of quiet reverence. Narrative distance is stable, though the anthropomorphizing of the storm glass ("hum of approval") feels slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is stable but suffers from "purple" tendencies and filter verbs ("She recalled," "She watched") that distance the reader. The usage of "sallied forward" is a register slip, forcing a military term into a moment of solitary exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent in its mythic, slightly archaic tone, but it suffers from repetition of the protagonist's title. The narrative distance is somewhat remote, prioritizing atmospheric description over immediate, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent and controls the tone well, balancing the grittiness of the farm with the wonder of the void. The shift from the mundane to the metaphysical is handled smoothly without breaking the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("eloquently silent," "defied logic") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The tone feels performative, prioritizing "literary" sounding phrases over precise observation or distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a somber, mythic distance. It falters slightly when incorporating prompt phrases that clash with the established register, but generally holds the POV well.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is consistent but generic, relying on familiar sentimental tropes ("slipped through the cracks," "silent testament"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a serious, atmospheric tone. However, it leans on melodramatic phrasing ("liquid fire," "guts of the machine") that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate, grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical tone throughout. However, it tends toward "purple" description ("spectral shards," "curled around") that prioritizes sound over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like register but uses filtering verbs ("she noticed," "she understood") that create unnecessary psychic distance. The tone is uniformly reverent, lacking the modulation of intensity or the gritty texture that would make the physical transformation (moss, vines) feel visceral rather than merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent but distant, utilizing filter verbs ("Elias realized," "Elias felt") that buffer the reader from immediate experience. The dialogue from the figure ("You’ve come at last") is stock "quest-giver" phrasing that lacks distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suits the fantasy genre, maintaining a stable close-third POV. However, the tone occasionally verges on melodramatic ("written her name like a confession") which limits the nuance of the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The POV remains stable, but the internal monologue often retreads established emotional ground rather than deepening the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately somber, fitting the post-traumatic context. However, it leans into melodrama ("ghost of its numbness," "voice like dry leaves"), and the dialogue feels slightly functional, serving primarily to advance the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the piece. The POV remains stable, though the reliance on simile-heavy descriptions occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the genre well. However, it leans on slightly worn phrasings ("silence heavier than," "darkness... like a held breath") that prevent the narrative persona from feeling distinct or fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the reliance on a specific syntactic structure (noun + verb + simile) becomes repetitive, creating a lulling rhythm that dulls the sharper moments.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the baroque setting. However, the dialogue tends toward the expository and on-the-nose ("You’re erasing it"), which reduces naturalism. The transition between the protagonist’s internal poetic register and his spoken defiance is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but melodramatic, relying on heavy adjective-noun pairings that distance the reader. The tone lacks the specific perceptual signature of a weary repairman.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and evocative, maintaining a lyrical tone that suits the subject matter. However, phrases like "groan of hinged awakenings" drift into abstraction that distances the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, the "lyrical" style occasionally distances the reader from the character's immediate physical reality, prioritizing poetic summary over grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans on poetic abstractions ("whisper against the silence") that distance the reader; tone modulation is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice leans on melodrama ("claws," "searing") and expository dialogue ("retrocognitively trapped") that breaks immersion. The tone wavers between historical noir and pulp fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The distance is well-controlled, though the interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("alchemy of the mind") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is generally consistent with the "venerable scribe" archetype, utilizing a formal and slightly archaic register that fits the setting. However, the use of filter verbs ("he realized," "he wondered") distances the reader, and the sudden tonal shift in the final sentence breaks the established mood.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a reverent tone suited to the subject. However, the POV occasionally filters experience through elevated abstractions ("scream muffled by snow") that distance the reader from Liora's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, but it is disrupted by the awkward insertion of the prompt phrase "credibly curious," which breaks the register. POV control is otherwise steady.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a uniform "primal elegance" that borders on purple prose. The heavy filtering of experience through poetic interpretation distances the reader from the immediate reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice aims for a literary tone but suffers from register breaks, most notably the insertion of the academic phrase "contextual clues" into a sensory moment. This jarring shift disrupts the established atmospheric mood and creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on "writerly" abstraction and poetic posturing ("numbers had changed meaning"). The tone supports the magical realism but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that separates the character’s lived experience from the author’s style.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly precious, prioritizing poetic posturing over narrative drive. The high register feels constructed to serve the "shoreline poet" archetype, creating a distance that prevents intimacy with the character's actual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, meditative tone that fits the "brazen calm" prompt. However, the POV relies too heavily on explaining the character's emotional state ("He didn't fear death") instead of allowing the scene's imagery and action to convey his defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a reflective polish suitable for the genre. However, the dialogue functions primarily as information delivery ("You came," "I had to see"), lacking subtextual tension or distinct character idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is stable and suitably melancholic but maintains a distant, expository distance, often explaining the significance of events ("understood... as if they were prayers") rather than allowing the reader to infer meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on similes (seven "like/as" constructions in a short space), creating a repetitive cadence that distances the reader. The tone wavers between gritty realism and melodramatic flourish ("breath rattling like a phonograph needle"), drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently summarizing the character's internal state with abstract nouns ("promise," "chaos," "possibility") instead of trusting the scene. The tone is elevated but verges on melodramatic with phrases like "ghost of its purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, fitting the high-fantasy genre. It maintains a steady distance, though it occasionally dips into filter verbs or summary that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized, creating a distance that muffles emotional impact; the poetic register feels imposed on the character rather than organic to her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is hampered by a pervasive syntactic loop ("Not X, but Y") that renders the tone monotonous and sermon-like. While the lexicon is consistent, the repetitive sentence structures distance the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending gothic sensibilities with precise observation ("celestial engine," "frayed hem"). The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Elias's perception, though the Q2 cap limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the high-fantasy genre, though it occasionally slips into melodrama. The POV remains securely with Lira, but the narrative distance feels somewhat remote due to the heavy reliance on metaphorical filtering of her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic "purple" phrasing ("dying beast," "spectral fingers," "twin voids"). While the mood is established, the narration often filters the experience through writerly descriptors rather than the character's immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone suited to the fable-like quality. Narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Elias’s perception. A few stock phrasings interrupt the unique voice ("life, as it does, had other plans"), slightly flattening the otherwise distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    Voice is consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on generic literary register. The reliance on familiar phrasing flattens the unique perspective of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into "ruin-porn" romanticism, prioritizing mood over distinct perception. The narrative distance is safe and observational, preventing deep immersion in Elias’s specific, sensory experience of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and fits the melancholic tone. Narrative distance is generally controlled, though it occasionally slips into summary or "telling" the reader what to think about the eye rather than showing the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is competent and atmospherically consistent but leans into purple prose ("flickered like half-remembered dreams"). The narrative distance is stable, though it tells more than it shows regarding the character's emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but marred by register slips like "empirically intuitive," which reads as forced. Some phrasing leans into cliché ("hushed tones," "flared to life") rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintained in an elevated, mythic register appropriate for the genre. Distance control is generally good, though the POV occasionally filters experience through summary ("felt like," "knew better") rather than immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive "scientific romantic" tone appropriate for the POV. However, the reliance on abstract emotional labeling ("density of presence") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately atmospheric for the subject matter. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly within Elias's deteriorating perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a melancholic tone. However, it leans heavily into a "workshop lyrical" register where emotional distance is maintained through pretty language. The POV is stable, but the filtering of every action through poetic interpretation distances the reader from the raw reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains the "saturated hush" tone well. However, the psychic distance slips when the narrator explains the symbolism of the ink to the reader ("A metaphor... for the way her own grief..."), breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully blends the technical ("induction coil") with the lyrical ("static and spite"). The tone matches the "ethereal grit" requirement well. There are moments where the voice leans into slightly overwrought similes ("sounded like falling"), but the overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediate action. The narrative distance remains stable, but the reliance on abstract summary prevents a sharp, distinctive perceptual signature from emerging. The tone fits the genre but lacks a unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the "clockpunk" aesthetic. The POV remains firmly with Elias, though the "eminently peculiar" phrasing in the opening feels like a slight filter-gap where the narrator labels a sensation before describing it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is polished but leans into a "writerly" register ("silent algebra of trespass") that creates distance. Dialogue functions primarily as exposition, lacking distinct character idioms to differentiate Elias from Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The noir-tinged academic voice is consistent and engaging, effectively bridging the gap between math and magic. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Elara’s perception throughout the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and perfectly modulated to the story's melancholic atmosphere. The control of psychic distance is exceptional, seamlessly blending the mechanical details of the booth with Mara’s emotional interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "archivist" persona. However, the prose occasionally drifts into generic literary poeticism ("past press against his ribs"). The narrative distance is stable, but the interiority often summarizes emotion rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally relies on filtering ("he felt," "he believed"). The dialogue is functional but serves largely as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than character idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, blending lyrical observation with the technical jargon of her trade ("celestial coordinates"). The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Liora’s perception without unmotivated head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified but leans into sentimental, purple prose ("curling into the night like smoke"). While the "whispering advisor" element is integrated into the voice, the tone lacks variation and feels monotic in its reverence. The perspective stays close to Lena but offers limited fresh insight.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from melodramatic stylistic choices ("volcanic tenderness", "threads of fire") that distance the reader. The POV filter is occasionally clogged by abstract labels ("analytically intuitive") instead of grounding the reader in Elara's immediate sensory or intellectual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "auroral sorrow" tone well. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("liquid starlight," "burning through his veins") that feels decorative rather than visceral. The voice struggles to balance the scientific context with the mythical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending noir elements with magical realism. The POV stays firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his maintenance-worker expertise, which adds authenticity to the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and controlled but leans into a reverent, precious tone that feels slightly manufactured; the "hushed tones" atmosphere distances the reader from visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and moody, suiting the genre, though it occasionally lapses into filtering ("Elias had felt it," "He knew") that distances the reader. The lyrical tone generally works but sometimes drifts into overwrought territory ("hush where past meets prophecy") that feels more like authorial overlay than character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on filtered interiority ("Lirien understood then") and familiar lyrical phrasing ("dancer’s precision," "old grief") that distances the reader from the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, maintaining a steady distance. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Elias wondered," "He didn't know," "He wasn't sure") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into elevated, "purple" diction that creates distance. The narrative tone is monotonous, maintaining a high-lyric register that doesn't modulate with the scene's (minimal) pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is competent and maintains a consistent Third Person Limited perspective. However, it leans on "tell" modifiers like "innocently cunning" rather than allowing voice to emerge through observation and syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, though it occasionally leans into "purple" description ("fractured rainbows," "golden shadows") that distances the reader. The tone effectively matches the magical realism genre but lacks distinct texture in the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable melancholic tone ("subdued ardor"). However, it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("arched like a sigh," "curtains of intention") that feels more authorial than character-driven. The POV is stable, but the prose sometimes prioritizes poetic effect over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The noir-speculative voice is consistent and atmospheric. It occasionally dips into melodrama ("confided in the silence"), but maintains a cohesive mood that suits the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic phrasing ("anguished joy," "siren song," "breath shallow"). While the tone matches the romanticized setting, the lack of distinct textural variation between the narration and the dialogue flattens the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the verbatim repetition of the attribute "softly deliberate," which breaks immersion. The perspective remains distant, observing the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and gentle, fitting the protagonist, but leans into melodramatic phrasing ("wreckage of his convictions"). The POV filters emotion through analysis, creating a distance that dampens the impact of the betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistently melancholic, suiting the atmospheric focus of the piece. However, the exposition "accidentally telepathic with plants" is jarringly direct and clunky, disrupting the otherwise lyrical tone. The perspective stays close to Elias, effectively filtering the world through his physical discomfort and longing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally dips into melodrama ("hushed thunder"). The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to Mira’s perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on poetic clichés ("sighs of dying stars," "laughter of comets") that create a layer of artificial distance. The tone feels derivative, prioritizing flowery description over distinct, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies on melodramatic similes ("clung to him like dust," "fractured like a lullaby") that feel performative rather than grounded in the character's perception. Emotional states are often summarized ("Elias’s breath hitched") rather than demonstrated through sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent myth-fable tone but suffers from distance and a lack of distinct texture. The narrative filter is often generic ("It was said that..."), and the "guardian" speaks in standard wise-NPC tropes that flatten the story's unique atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.3)
    The point of view drifts between Elias ("Elias knew") and Mira ("Mira watched"), preventing deep immersion in either character's immediate experience. The voice adopts a consistent but standard "fable" tone that occasionally leans into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("clawing at the twilight"). The "seraphically mundane" descriptor feels forced and distracts from the sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for high fantasy, maintaining a formal and elevated tone. While effective, the voice occasionally slips into melodramatic descriptors ("diminutive titan") that feel slightly self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent, fitting the melancholy sci-fi tone. The narrative distance is controlled, though the voice lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic texture that would elevate it to the next band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable melancholic tone. However, the POV creates distance by summarizing emotions ("she felt something like hope") instead of embodying them. There are moments of "telling" that filter the experience, such as the direct explanation of the "thunderous serenity" description.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice relies on generic literary descriptors ("lazy coils," "gnarled fingers") that lack a distinct perceptual signature. The tone feels somewhat distant, filtering the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a somber, reflective tone appropriate for the subject. However, it occasionally slips into "writerly" phrasing ("stubborn dream," "fragile defiance") that feels slightly constructed rather than organically observed.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overburdened with simile constructions ("like a blade," "like a confession," "like old bones") which clutter the prose. This filter of comparison distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the character and feels repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.0)
    The third-person narration relies heavily on filter verbs ("caught his attention," "Elias had seen") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. The voice drifts into melodramatic summary ("something more dangerous") rather than trusting the events to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The POV is consistent but the voice lacks a unique perceptual signature, leaning on elevated, slightly purple narration ("vials of voices," "petrified emotions"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone feels somewhat generic for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("fracturing the light into a thousand tranquil blazes"). While the POV is stable, the tone occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing that distances the reader from the gritty reality implied by the "rust and dust" opening.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic but suffers from distance. The tone remains serious and elevated throughout, which flattens the emotional dynamism of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the noir/steampunk aesthetic, but it suffers from syntactic monotony. The rhythmic control is hampered by a repetitive sentence structure that often places the subject at the start, creating a "drumbeat" effect that dulls the tension during key reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a melancholic, lyrical tone that suits the magical realism mode. The shift into the final realization is handled with tonal control, though the reliance on explanatory internal monologue slightly distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suiting the magical realist tone. There are moments of filter usage ("Liora watched as," "She had felt it before") that distance the reader slightly, but the narrative stance remains stable and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric but stumbles over the forced inclusion of clunky prompt phrases like "retrocognitively trapped". These shifts in register disrupt the otherwise meditative and poetic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady control over the scene. The prose occasionally slips into standard "literary" phrasing ("whisper of silk," "flicker of movement") that blunts the distinctiveness of the POV. The transition between the grounded opening and the magical conclusion is managed with a stable narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but generic, relying on a "literary" register that occasionally drifts into melodrama ("turning myself into a question"). While the focus is tight on Mara, the narration lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to standard descriptions of wonder and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a unified tone throughout. POV distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally dips into poetic abstraction that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical fable quality that suits the material well. The distance is controlled, though the "wisdom" filtering through the narration occasionally verges on intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, with a suitable melancholic tone. However, the spatial choreography failure (teleporting to the door) indicates a lapse in POV control. The narration glides over necessary physical actions to reach the emotional beat, sacrificing clarity for pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated ("tapestry of his solitude"), reading more like an authorial overlay than the specific perception of a weathered boatman. The narration maintains distance, preventing full immersion in the character's immediate physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but creates distance through heavy use of filter verbs ("He could hear," "He had seen," "He understood"). The tone aims for reverence but often slips into sentimental territory ("brushing the dry clay as if it were a sleeping child"), lacking the "sharpness" required to balance the gentleness.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice suffers from intrusive labeling, most notably the adverbial tag "replied, wistfully pragmatic." The narrative distance is stable, yet the tone occasionally drifts into sentimental abstraction rather than grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from register drift, mixing fantasy elements with scientific terminology ("atomically reflective") that disrupts the established mood.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and poetic, suiting the fable mode, though dialogue often feels stylized and unnatural ("voice the color of wet stone"). The tone holds well across the shards.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, maintaining a stable POV throughout. However, the dialogue tends toward the functional and cliché ("Not a theory. A solution."), serving to explain the plot rather than reveal character nuance or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent and the tone matches the genre. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("barely noticed," "saw it") that creates unnecessary distance in high-tension moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is melodramatic and relies on stock "literary mystery" phrasing without a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is unnatural, functioning as an information dump rather than human speech (e.g., "You draw the dead... Only when they’re forgotten"). The narrative distance is consistent, but the tone is generic noir-lite.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but frequently dips into melodramatic phrasing ("howling like a thing betrayed") that distances the reader. The narrative often summarizes realizations ("The nail had been the key all along") instead of allowing the reader to infer them through the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "writerly" distancing, using high-register abstract nouns ("amnesty," "possibility," "disbelief") that flatten the immediacy of the POV. The prose draws attention to the author's hand rather than the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a consistent contemplative distance that suits the character. The transition between the startup flashback and the present moment is smooth, though the "perceptively calm" tag feels slightly like a label.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a somber, magical tone appropriate for the genre. However, the POV occasionally over-explains the protagonist's emotional state ("shone with fear and wonder") rather than trusting the imagery to convey the depth of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a "warlike serenity" that fits the genre and the character's hardened exterior. Interiority is well-balanced with action, ensuring the reader feels the weight of Veyra's burden without excessive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy "fantasy filter" that creates distance through melodramatic phrasing ("whispering secrets," "bleeding into the soil"). The POV stays with Elias, but the reliance on summary and abstract emotional labels prevents the reader from fully inhabiting his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately gothic, matching the setting. However, some phrasings ("dusky resolve," "threadbare patience") lean towards purple prose, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, slightly gritty texture appropriate for a former roadie. The shift from internal monologue to dialogue is smooth, though the "confidently uncertain" line feels like an authorial insertion rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, though it leans into melodrama ("heart ached," "touching distance"). The POV remains stable on Elara, but the interiority often slips into explanatory summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric, suiting the magical realism genre well. It blends the mechanical and the natural without jarring shifts, though it occasionally leans into familiar "wise librarian" cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly affected, relying on "writerly" phrasing ("prismatic whispers," "reliquary of what could have been") that creates distance. The tone feels performative rather than grounded in the gritty reality of a doomsday bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent—melancholic, precise, and attuned to the protagonist’s "daringly methodical" nature. The third-person limited perspective stays tightly anchored in Lena’s sensory experience and memory, handling the backstory transitions smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly reverent, relying on a "mystical" tone that distances the reader from the immediate action. While the control is steady, the register leans into melodrama without the rhythmic variation needed to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suits the magical realism genre. However, narrative distance slips into telling at key moments ("He had come to stop her, she realized"), and the "telepathy" explanation disrupts the immediate flow of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a reverent, lyrical distance appropriate for the high-fantasy mode. However, the rhyme "beautician mortician" clashes tonally with the solemnity of "frost-kissed linen," and the interiority often slips into explanatory summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to melodrama and abstraction ("something like memory"). The POV remains close to Mira but filters the climactic realization through explanatory labels rather than visceral, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a moody, reflective tone. However, it leans toward purple prose ("words spilling out like the tide," "impatient creditor") and explicit internal labelling. The metaphorical "cloak of doubt" blurring into a literal voice creates a slight distance/reliability issue without establishing clear ground rules.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, maintaining a steady tone throughout. However, it drifts into melodrama ("forgotten dream," "blinded by the light") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but suffers from over-confidence in abstract assertions ("living equation of wind and memory"). The tone is uniform throughout, lacking the modulation that accompanies shifting tension or emotional states. It reads more like a prologue or vignette than a fully voiced story.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is consistent and the narrative voice is competent, fitting the fantasy genre. However, the dialogue from the mystical figure lacks distinctness and leans into cliché instructional speech, reducing the overall voice quality.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and fits the fable-like tone, though it leans into melodrama ("hollow ache," "liquid gold"). The dialogue feels artificial and stagey, serving plot exposition rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the sci-fi setting, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose. The filter verbs ("he realized," "he felt") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic, purple prose ("bled into the horizon," "static from the void"). While the tone is unified, the lack of distinct textural variation makes the emotional beats feel performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, perfectly suiting the "world ending in silence" premise. The focalization remains tight on Elias, filtering the cosmic stakes through his specific, humble perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and reasonably atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bones of a forgotten song," "rising tide of forgetting"). The tone manages the "twilight" mood well, but the writerly flourishes sometimes distance the reader from the protagonist's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.0)
    Narrative voice is consistent but generic, relying on familiar fantasy registers without a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a dense, overwrought "literary" register that clutters the action. The heavy reliance on similes and abstract nouns dampens the immediacy of the survival scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose reports the character's state ("Kael had heard the stories") rather than immersing the reader in his specific sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is consistent but distant, often summarizing internal states ("Lena was notably receptive") instead of inhabiting them. The voice is competent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish it from standard exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, though it occasionally tips into melodrama ("ghosts of forgotten melodies"). The POV remains stable with Elias, effectively filtering the world through his conductor-turned-gardener persona, though the emotional register feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is cohesive but overly reliant on "like [abstract concept]" similes ("like a question without an answer," "like a second shadow"). This heavy filtration creates a melodramatic tone that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama ("graveyard of numbers," "slithered like a serpent") and diagnostic telling. The narration creates a barrier by explaining the character's state ("stoically sensitive") rather than allowing it to emerge through voice and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric but suffers from forced phrasing. The specific prompt attribute "serenely electric" creates a jarring repetition that breaks the stylistic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into overwrought, flowery descriptions ("stars bent like broken glass," "trembling gold circle") that distance the reader. The insertion of prompt phrases like "resiliently positive" feels mechanical and disrupts the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans on filter verbs ("Elias realized," "Elias felt") and interpretative phrasing ("seemed to say") that creates distance from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the setting. Dialogue, however, tends toward the stilted and speech-like ("Then we will make them ours"), which flattens the character distinction. The POV remains firmly with Lirien, providing a stable window into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent atmospheric tone. Dialogue is functional but occasionally drifts into melodrama ("Neither should you") that feels less natural than the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The POV remains firmly anchored in Elias’s perception, effectively filtering the surreal events through his specific guilt and technical expertise. The narrative voice is consistent, though it occasionally dips into repetitive poetic structures that slightly flatten the distinctness of the horror.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is competent and consistent, though the phrase "death certificate error survivor" feels cumbersome and prompt-heavy. The rhythmic device of counting heartbeats is effective, but the overall tone leans into a passive melancholy that distances the reader from the urgency of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like quality. However, the tone remains somewhat static, lacking the modulation of distance or intensity that would accompany a true rise in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the genre, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("bones ache," "hollow-eyed"). The perspective remains firmly with Elias, filtering the strangeness effectively through his researcher-turned-victim lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice leans into melodramatic abstraction ("shattered prism," "half-remembered lullaby") that creates distance rather than intimacy. The point of view frequently summarizes Liora's internal state using labels ("The gap... had always been her prison") instead of demonstrating it through perception and reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately moody, fitting the dystopian genre. However, it occasionally drifts into authorial intrusion with academic phrasing ("liminal space") that feels disconnected from the mailman’s likely lexicon. The narrative distance is generally stable, though it filters perception through "he knew" and "he recognized" tags.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but leans heavily into "poetic" abstraction that distances the reader from immediate experience. The prose creates a cohesive mood, yet the reliance on filter verbs and interpretive summaries ("felt the urge," "marking time") weakens the emotional immediacy. The voice feels polished but performative.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the genre, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("whisper of a forgotten dream"). The narrative distance is controlled, but the reliance on poetic filter verbs distances the reader from immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished in its lyrical mode but maintains a high psychic distance that keeps the reader at arm's length. The tone borders on monochromatic, with a "hushed" quality that never modulates to reflect urgency or frustration.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone, but relies on abstract phrasing ("spaces between thoughts," "hush of cosmic possibility") that creates distance. While the register is stable, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature or the rhythmic control to sharpen the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, effectively filtering the world through Elias's obsessive lens. The voice matches the folklorist persona—studious yet desperate—though it occasionally slips into standard genre cadences during high-emotion beats.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, melancholic tone that suits the setting. There is a minor slip into retrospective omniscience ("though Elara didn’t know it yet"), but the prose generally reflects the protagonist's fractured interiority well.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining Maren's understanding ("She knew what it was: a bridge") rather than letting the reader infer it. The tone is appropriately mythic but occasionally drifts into melodrama ("kissed her cheeks") that distances the reader from the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a sombre, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift from technical observation to emotional urgency is managed smoothly within the close third-person perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a mood of quiet melancholy. It occasionally drifts into over-written "authorial" observation (e.g., "split a world in two") that distances the reader from Elias’s immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably melodic, successfully establishing a mood of sophisticated melancholy. However, the POV shift from a grounded scientific observer to a passive recipient of supernatural exposition creates a slight disconnect in the narrative distance during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a story about a balladeer, maintaining a steady tone of wonder. However, the prose occasionally drifts into standard fantasy registers ("shimmer," "flickering like a candle flame") that blur the distinctness of the perspective. The POV remains stable with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.7)
    The POV is consistent and functional, staying close to Lira’s perceptions. However, the voice occasionally slips into telling emotional states ("heavy with significance") rather than demonstrating them through action or internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("quiet was explosive," "spooled wholeness"). The filter verbs ("He decided," "He understood") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a reverent, contemplative distance suitable for the protagonist. However, it relies occasionally on filter verbs ("She felt," "She understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is competent but nondescript, utilizing a standard third-person limited perspective. The phrasing "diligently curious" feels awkward and forced, likely to satisfy a prompt constraint rather than rising organically from the voice. Interiority is mostly expository ("He had no idea what it meant").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic, "purple" phrasing ("metallic whispers," "shimmering like captured sunlight") that creates a fable-like distance. This aesthetic sheen glosses over the lack of gritty, specific detail in the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and gentle, fitting the tone, though its distancing effect prevents the reader from feeling the visceral grit of the orchard's decay or the ghost's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a fable-like tone. However, it occasionally slips into sentimental territory, and the register feels slightly forced in moments like "vouchsafed his secret" and "bruised awe."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, matching the gothic/steampunk tone. The POV remains tightly focused on Mira, filtering the world through her weariness effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on a generic "literary" register that feels detached. The tone is earnest but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often telling the reader what to feel ("cacophony of regrets") instead of showing it through unique observation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like mode. The use of italics for dialogue and the rhythmic cadence of the prose support the atmospheric intent, though the register occasionally drifts into purple territory ("cool pulse of something older than words").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but marred by awkward phrasing inserted to meet constraints. The phrase "sturdy brittle" disrupts the syntactic flow twice, appearing as an ungrammatical modifier that draws attention to the artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the emotional significance of events instead of dramatizing them. The tone is overly sentimental, reducing the "grain elevator" grit to a soft focus.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("unspool," "quaking reverie") that feels constructed to house specific phrases rather than arising organically from the character’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on "purple" descriptors ("prism-minded," "refracting through layers") that distance the reader. The tone prioritizes poetic-sounding abstraction over grounded, embodied focalization, making the experience feel remote.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.0)
    The phrase "symphonically minded mind" is a significant stumble, creating an awkward rhythmic echo and a label-heavy filter. The narrative relies on explanatory filters ("he realized," "he understood") rather than trusting the focalizer's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.7)
    The POV is consistent and the voice has a polished, albeit slightly mannered, literary quality suitable for the genre. Dialogue is functional but stiff, sounding more like written thesis statements than organic speech ("You've been translating silence").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical ("map the contours of human sorrow"), fitting the protagonist’s introspective nature. However, the dialogue drifts into theatrical philosophizing ("Silence isn’t something you measure"), which feels less like natural speech and more like written text.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dialogue suffers from heavy cliché ("playing with fire," "wiser than you look"), which undercuts the distinctness of the voices. While the narrative voice is consistent, it often relies on stock phrasing that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is functional but relies on labels ("intrepid") and filter verbs ("She understood now") to convey information. The narrative distance is stable, but the prose lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is competent but monochromatic, utilizing a standard thriller tone without a distinct perceptual filter. The narration tells the reader what to think about the environment ("defied logic," "unnatural") rather than showing the strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suits the high-fantasy tone, effectively managing the synesthetic perception. However, filter verbs ("She had learned," "She thought of") distance the reader during the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. However, the dialogue functions primarily as exposition, lacking the distinct idiom or subtext required to elevate the interaction above a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident and controlled, effectively managing the shifts between the protagonist's own thoughts and the "borrowed" personas. The distinction between the "Poet" and "Mathematician" voices contributes to the story's texture without breaking the third-person limited perspective. The tone remains consistent even during the surreal climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a stable POV. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama with breathless phrasing that distances the reader rather than immersing them.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("world’s logic cracked like thin ice"). The tone holds steady, even if the prose tends toward overwrought description rather than active observation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and controls distance well, suiting the genre. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("guts of some long-dead traveler") that clashes slightly with the wistful mood.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fable-like narrative voice is consistent and fits the genre, though it creates a slight emotional distance. The POV is stable, but interiority often drifts into explanatory summary ("He knew their secrets") rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a suitable distance for the cosmic subject matter. However, the dialogue slips into standard action-movie patter, which clashes slightly with the more lyrical introspection of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally slips into "writerly" affectation ("bruised twilight," "slithered"). The POV stays close to Elias, but the "anonymous philosopher" tone of the notes jars against the skipper's reticence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyrical, high-fantasy voice is consistent and establishes a distinct mood. However, the tone borders on "precious" at times, prioritizing aesthetic sound over narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. However, the tone occasionally drifts into preciousness ("quiet explosiveness") that prioritizes poetic effect over character immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the gothic tone. Narrative distance is controlled, though the interiority sometimes drifts into abstract sentimentality rather than grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is a consistent but derivative fairy-tale register that leans on "poetic" abstractions ("threads of silver and shadow") rather than concrete observation. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the narration feels like a standard genre template rather than a specific character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from over-explanation and filter verbs ("Elias knew," "Elias had found," "betrayed his... nature"). The tone aims for lyrical profundity but often lands on "telling" the reader how to feel rather than evoking the emotion through distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled but suffers from register clashes, particularly "heuristically gentle," which disrupts the literary tone. Phrasing like "uncloaked the truth" drifts into melodrama, breaking the established groundedness.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a suitable tone, but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the significance of the slide and Elias's feelings ("It was the last of its kind," "His motivation was simple"). The POV distance prevents intimate connection during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and moody, fitting the noir-adjacent tone. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("groaned under the weight of the night"), which distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but leans on familiar genre idioms ("voice like distant thunder") and stiff expository dialogue. POV is consistent, but the "weather man" sounds like a plot device rather than a distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but drifts into clinical phrasing ("uncorking his suppressed creativity") that clashes with the atmospheric tone. The third-person limited POV is maintained without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or psychological depth. The prose relies on standard "fic" descriptors ("humid embrace," "old bruises") rather than a character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, fable-like quality that suits the material. The POV is controlled and distinct. The tone supports the mythic elements, though the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hues of wonder") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, filtering the world through Eli’s specific sensory inputs ("static," "circuits"). The tone matches the pacing, though the reflective distance remains somewhat static until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it leans on familiar literary tropes. The transition to summarized dialogue for the neighbors creates distance, but the focalization remains stable on Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the setting ("groaning like a dying beast"). However, the tone remains slightly detached, prioritizing atmospheric description over immediate character interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric. However, the use of filter verbs and summary ("Marlowe knew," "felt different") creates unnecessary distance during moments that would benefit from direct sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, leaning into "purple" descriptions ("darkest light of all," "creases sharp as... forgotten truths") that distance the reader. The tone is persistently melodramatic, lacking the varied modulation or grounding needed to make the summoner's tranquility feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voices lack distinction, merging into a shared, somewhat melodramatic register ("returned it with interest," "dust of the stars"). The phrase "her voice patiently nimble" is a register break that reads as an awkward insertion rather than natural character description.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, fitting the gothic/sci-fi mood. However, it occasionally slips into melodrama ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but derivative, leaning heavily on high-fantasy registers without a distinct perceptual signature. The POV remains stable, but the narration filters the world through standard genre descriptors rather than character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by register breaks like "progressive disclosure" used as a magical technique. The tone struggles to balance lyrical fantasy with inserted prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "ghost whisperer" archetype. However, the unmotivated shift to present tense ("She weaves truth carefully...") disrupts the established past-tense distance. The prose occasionally slips into explanatory telling ("Mara didn't believe in accidents") rather than trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience. While the POV remains stable with Ren, the emotional filter is often abstract ("demure audacity") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, relying on filter verbs ("began to intuit," "saw the truth") that dampen immediacy. The perspective stays with Elias but offers little distinct interior texture, defaulting to generic reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice strives for epic significance but lands on melodrama, using "lyrically prophetic" as a tag rather than demonstrating that quality in the prose. The POV is consistent but filters the world through heavy-handed adjectives that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical, wistful voice is consistent and appropriate for the "penny poet" persona, though it borders on preciousness. The narrative distance remains stable, though the girl's dialogue ("It's like magic") feels functional and indistinct from the narrator's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent and the "fleshly ethereal" tone is attempted through diction like "skeletal," "pulse," and "resonator." The voice is slightly heavy on adjectives ("azure-coat," "brass dials"), but the narrative distance is well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains a high psychic distance, prioritizing poetic observation over immediate immersion. The tendency to explain the significance of every image ("fractured... like a broken promise") reduces the reader's engagement with the raw sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is a standard thriller third-person that prioritizes plot information over distinct perception. There is a tendency toward melodrama ("Voss’s victims were always people who’d challenged the system") that flattens the nuance of the "preventable death" angle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately moody for the genre. However, the tone occasionally slips into melodrama with overwrought phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric but stumbles significantly when integrating required phrases. The awkward syntax driven by prompt adherence ("spent throughout the evolution of his life") disrupts the otherwise consistent third-person limited perspective. These mechanical insertions break the immersion of the character's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is a standard third-person thriller narration that frequently slips into "telling" ("Lena was brightly attentive," "Lena’s motivation wasn’t just professional"). It lacks a unique perceptual filter, relying on the narrator to explain the character's state rather than showing it through voice-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but steeped in melodramatic fantasy tropes ("gnarled," "frigid," "monstrous"). The tone struggles to integrate prompt phrases naturally, resulting in syntactic awkwardness.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The POV remains securely anchored in Elias's shifting perspective, managing the distance between his initial detachment and final connection well. The voice is consistent, though occasionally slightly self-conscious in its poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice suffers a catastrophic register break with the phrase "nurturing intersubjective understanding," which clashes with the established rustic, sentimental tone. The point of view feels engineered rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone ("voice that wasn't a voice") but leans on high-fantasy conventions that distance the reader. While the POV is stable, the "peripheral awareness" mechanic is described rather than enacted through a distinct perceptual texture in the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent and grammatically controlled but adopts a generic "literary" tone that keeps the reader at a distance. The narrative distance is static, summarizing thoughts and feelings (e.g., "feeling a sense of peace") rather than embodying them through distinct perception or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a scholarly and reverent tone that suits the protagonist. Internal monologue and perception are well-controlled, avoiding head-hopping and staying firmly within Elias's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on a "poetic" register typical of the genre without distinguishing itself. Dialogue is functional but relies on stock mysterious-guide phrasings ("You always forget, but I remember for you") that lack character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a somewhat elevated, mythic tone appropriate for the fable-like logic. However, the tone occasionally slips into melodrama ("madness, but the luminous ache told him it was right"), which distances the reader from the gritty reality of the station's collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and gentle, fitting the somber mood, but suffers from filtering and telling ("scent of hope," "decisively kind"). The dialogue ("Hymn the mundane") feels slightly unnatural, reading more like a prompt instruction than authentic character speech.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and functional, adhering to a standard genre register without a distinct perceptual signature. While the prose is controlled, the narration relies on summary and assertion ("she understood") to bridge gaps in logic, preventing the reader from experiencing the character's realization directly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is polished and fable-like, maintaining a consistent distance that suits the mythic tone. It occasionally slips into "telling" internal states ("She was a forgiving skeptic") rather than showing them through behavior, but the overall texture is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fantasy genre, maintaining a stable third-person focus on Liora. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" phrasing ("mist like a sleeping dragon," "quiet between heartbeats") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the atmospheric setting well. There is a slight register shift between the "memed" viral context and the "loam" of the garden, but the control over psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, though it occasionally dips into melodramatic filtering ("lucidly watchful," "liminal space"). The tone supports the magical realism but feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into a derivative "fairytale" register ("swollen and gold," "newborn's fist"). While the tone matches the whimsical content, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate it from generic genre prose.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a fable-like elevation that suits the subject matter. The POV remains firmly anchored in Elias’s perception, though the phrasing occasionally borders on overly "writerly" self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and suitably atmospheric for the magical realism genre. The POV remains tightly controlled on Elias, filtering the world effectively through his obsession with light and mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though occasionally overwrought ("shingled hush"). The awkward phrasing "boundary-lessly" disrupts the lyrical tone and pulls the reader out of the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, handling the shift between memory and present action well. The tone remains controlled, though the narrator occasionally steps in to interpret feelings rather than simply showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately paced for the reflective content. The shift to a more directive tone at the end ("Now, you listen") jars slightly with the established interiority but works within the surreal context.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, resulting in dialogue that sounds like written speeches ("The carnival leaves, but the world keeps turning") rather than natural conversation. The tone is cohesive, but the lack of distinct, grounded idioms makes the characters feel like archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and appropriate for the fable-like tone, though it relies on standard emotive markers ("heart pounded," "swallowed hard"). The voice is consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it to the next band.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but leans into melodramatic or purple register ("serene upheaval," "quiet collapse"). The tone is cohesive but feels slightly performative, prioritizing sounding "literary" over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady, slightly elevated tone suited to the "philosophical" content. POV remains firmly with Elias. However, the voice occasionally drifts into purple prose ("breath a ghost," "secrets waited") that feels slightly affected.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, lyrical register appropriate for the protagonist. However, the reliance on high-register, poetic phrasing occasionally feels performative, prioritizing sound over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a fable. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama or purple prose ("remnants of the egg’s dream"), which distances the reader from the visceral reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly sentimental and relies on "purple" descriptors ("kelp-drift peace"). Dialogue sounds written rather than spoken, lacking distinct idiom or natural rhythm, and functions entirely to articulate the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly reliant on "purple" descriptors and stacked similes that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The narrative summarizes emotional states ("heart a flickering lantern") instead of allowing them to manifest in voice or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. Dialogue is functional but stiff, serving as a vehicle for thematic exposition ("I’m breaking the pattern") rather than naturalistic character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice affects a "poetic" tone that often drifts into melodrama ("quiet alchemy," "living tapestry") without a distinct character signature. The prose prioritizes sounding profound over clarity and distinctness, creating a distance between the reader and the character's immediate experience. The consistent register is competent but feels like a stylistic overlay rather than an organic expression of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is stable and suitably mythic for the genre, though it occasionally lapses into exposition ("Elias was ethically diligent"). The distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus on the ritualistic aspect of the character's duty.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. There is a tendency toward preciousness ("velveteen gloom," "looping script"), but the POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but leans into "purple" prose that distances the reader from the immediate moment. The narrative maintains a fable-like tone but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic perceptual signature for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable somber tone. The POV is stable, though it leans occasionally into melodramatic phrasing ("beautiful in the way a knife is beautiful") that draws attention to the writer rather than the character.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into the protagonist's self-aggrandizement without enough narrative distance or irony. The shift in register from intellectual brooding to the melodramatic hope of the ending feels disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it occasionally leans into sentimental phrasing ("fragile, like ice over a pond"). The perspective stays firmly with Miss Voss, but the summary mode distances the reader from immediate sensory experience during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.0)
    Voice is consistent but suffers from "telling" syndrome, relying on labels ("informally wise") and exposition rather than dramatic demonstration. The narrative distance is too remote to create visceral engagement with the memory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice relies on stock "literary fantasy" cadences and familiar syntactical patterns. The narration is competent but lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature, blending Elias's thoughts with generic narrator observation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias's specific sensory bias. The prose maintains a "hushed" intensity that aligns perfectly with the subject matter. The personification of the environment is handled with stylistic control, reinforcing the animist worldview without becoming twee.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning on standard fantasy prose rhythms. The statue's dialogue feels writerly ("incisively kind," "surgical precision"), reading more like an authorial mouthpiece than a distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, writerly phrasing ("hope like a bruise," "ghost of what could have been") that feels performed. POV distance is stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and suitably atmospheric for the genre, though it occasionally leans into sentimental phrasing. The tonal shift from grim city to hopeful interior is handled with control, though the sentiment is somewhat saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally leans into overwrought imagery ("voice like aged parchment"). The fable-like tone is maintained, but the lack of distinct acoustic texture between the narrator and the baker flattens the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic distance that suits the fable-like tone. Control over the magical realism elements is steady without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from gothic melodrama that distances the reader ("weeping eye," "unbosomed"). The whispering advisor’s dialogue feels artificial, reading like a tutorial prompt rather than natural speech. The tone strives for profundity but achieves only a surface-level grimness that lacks distinct character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, effectively utilizing synesthetic imagery ("fractal paths," "dubbing the driftwood") to define Leeward's perception. The tone remains consistent, though the polish sometimes smooths over the tension that a rougher or more urgent voice might have provided. The shift to "indigo" and "raw and wild" laughter aligns well with the accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the "sunwashed dread" tone perfectly. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mira, filtering observations through her cartographer’s lens ("decoding the way they shifted"). The prose maintains a consistent texture that enhances the weird-fantasy mood.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly academic, but the dialogue often drifts into speechifying that feels unnatural for the setting ("To recapture the truth by letting the lie stand"). Liora and Elias speak in thematic topic sentences rather than character-driven interchanges, reducing naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric ("hushed blaze," "interlaced with"). It occasionally leans into sentimentality, but the tone matches the romantic, melancholic subject matter without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally strains for a "literary" register that feels forced. The POV remains stable, filtering the world through Elias's focus on history and preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the shift to horror in the final paragraph feels slightly rushed in its pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by a repetitive syntactic tic used four times in a short space: "Lena didn’t [understand/know] X, but she [understood/knew] Y." This template cadence flattens the character's distinct perception into a rhetorical formula.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is competent but relies on melodramatic filtering ("too many times—but tonight was different") that creates a generic "weary captain" tone. Dialogue functions primarily as exposition for the magical mechanics and thematic thesis, lacking distinct idiomatic textures for the two speakers.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, noir-adjacent tone that fits the subject matter. The POV remains stable with Elias. There is a tendency toward slightly purple description ("weight of unspoken words pressing against his ribs like a second heartbeat"), but the stylistic texture is generally controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, slightly elevated tone that suits the subject matter. The POV remains firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his regret. The "uncommonly thoughtful" attribute is integrated via dialogue ("he'd heard") somewhat awkwardly, but the overall voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice often slips into melodramatic or writerly registers ("eyes that had once mapped stars," "scripture"). The narrative distance collapses into explanatory telling at key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The noir-inflected voice is consistent ("cold calculus," "highest bidder") and fits the mood. Dialogue is functional but expository, reading slightly like NPC quest-giving ("Choice time... Left or right?") rather than natural, goal-driven conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fairy-tale quality that suits the subject matter. The POV stays firmly with Liora, filtering the magic through her specific understanding of "beasts." The tone manages the "cosmic intimacy" requirement well, balancing the magical scale with personal grief.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and elevated, fitting the magical realism tone. However, it leans toward the melodramatic ("onyx ink bleed... like a confession") and maintains a high level of distance that prevents deep intimacy with the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elegiac tone that fits the "ghostly resolve" of the piece. At times, the register drifts into slightly purple abstraction ("droplet of liquid starlight," "gash of light") which softens the gritty reality of the recycled ship, but the overall control of distance and mood is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic ("converse in silent tongues"). Dialogue is stiff and functional ("You fulfill them without even trying"), serving primarily to deliver exposition about the prophecy. The POV filters the world through heavy-handed interpretation rather than direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent and fits the genre, but relies on stock phrasing ("dancing with secrets," "thoughts snapping together like gears"). The perspective is stable, though the narration tends to filter information ("Mira knew") rather than immersing the reader in the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, mythic tone but relies heavily on stock phrasing ("half-remembered dream," "living shadows," "storm breaks"). The perspective is consistent, but the "kissed by something unseen" and "air decided to forget him" personifications feel like standard genre stylistic furniture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative, lyrical mode throughout. However, the high density of metaphor and elevated diction occasionally creates an overwrought effect that prioritizes style over narrative intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on melodramatic phrasing ("storm in his chest," "sound like surrender"). Dialogue feels performative and stiff, serving as a vehicle for plot points and themes rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice adopts a consciously poetic tone ("blooming resistance," "luminous fracture") that often distances the reader from the gritty reality of the character's situation. The shift between the vagrant’s perspective and the omniscient summaries of the "resistance" feels distinct but lacks the confident control of a fully inhabited POV.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and slightly elevated tone that suits the magical realism of the setting. Interiority is well-balanced with observation, and the perspective remains tightly anchored in Elias's experience of the music and the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and suited to the mythic tone, maintaining a consistent third-person limited perspective. The phrase "empirically whimsical" stands out as tonally jarring—distinct, but perhaps too modern or analytical for the established folk-fable rhythm. Otherwise, the voice successfully manages the transition from quiet introspection to the urgency of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a dignified, elevated register suitable for the subject matter. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("rhythmically placid cadence," "cerulean regret") that feels more like constructed prose than a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual lens: “patterns as familiar as the scars on her wrists” carries her idiom of craft and pain. Syntax lengthens under grief, then shortens at the shadow’s appearance, mirroring pulse. Jaren’s diction—“That’s not yours” versus her crisp “It is now”—creates status clash without caricature. One clause drifts toward poetic register: “the weight of silence” is borderline, but context justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perception is filtered through tactile and thermal detail consistent with deafness. Syntax lengthens under wonder—“streaks of crimson and sapphire bloomed”—then fractures into short clauses to mimic breathless recognition. No head-hopping; Liora’s emotions are only externally sensed via the device. The rhythmic modulation mirrors the chromatic crescendo, achieving lyric control without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to the undertaker’s mortician sensorium: every noticed detail (oilcloth, algae-slick sand, salt-crisp pages) carries death-care precision. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses as the sea rises, then exhales into longer, luminous sentences when the light returns, mirroring his inner stillness. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “occupying impossible spaces had always been his gift” could only belong to this narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Liora; perceptual signature is tactile—sun-warmed tiles, cool silver, trembling baskets—never ventriloquizing children or elders. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for storytelling nights, clipped fragments for sanction updates. No dialogue, so voice carries through weighted nouns and verbs. One filter-verb cluster (“she noticed something glinting”) but forgiven under stress beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Lien’s perceptual filter: brass warmth, jade coolness, fog response to breath. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short imperatives (“Breathe”) at climax, mirroring respiratory method.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction—“coaxing ivy into arches”—signals artisan precision. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary clauses during street scene, then exhales into longer cadence in willow cradle, mirroring shock and aftermath. No head-hopping; echoes’ layered voices remain external. Filter verbs serve POV: “she knew” is justified by her scholarly background.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual sieve: she notices clinks, smells popcorn, gauges Vey by gesture. Syntax tightens under pressure—“breath hitched” vs. reflective earlier cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries through rhythmic, tactile diction. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood”) could trim, but texture remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s synesthetic lens; color-hearing is never explained from outside. Syntax ripples—long clauses for aurora, staccato for foil cooling—mirroring perceptual shifts. No filter-verb stacks; “the foil cooled in his hands” keeps immediacy. Voice sustains battered marvel without sliding into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter: synesthetic metaphors (“windows glowing like fireflies trapped in glass”) are consistent and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates from long, breathy sentences to fragmentary exchanges under pressure. No dialogue over-articulates; Kael’s indirection suits the flower-code premise. Clean free-indirect control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: selective attention to smells, clicks, drips.

Occasional lyrical uplift (“chorus of old ghosts”) remains within Elias’s artistic lexicon, keeping distance controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: maritime metaphors, stunt-worker body awareness, selective auditory focus on whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays welded to E-7X’s perceptual circuitry: diction of “alloy chassis,” “audio receptors,” “static in the gaps” is consistent yet musical. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for loops, staccato fragments for cracks—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; the humans remain distant silhouettes, appropriate to his isolation. The lyric compression (“world *shifted*”) is taught early and paid off at collapse, justifying the italics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is cinematic—light, film stock, seat numbers. Syntax tightens under pressure: short exchanges, tactile detail. Dialogue carries subtext (“You’re lying” / “I know”) without losing natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s gnarled perceptions; diction (“brittle as old parchment,” “knees popping like dry twigs”) is sensory, never decorative. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ritual polishing, clipped fragments for discovery. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are waived.

Rhythm modulates—long hypnotic sentences mirror fog drift, then fragment at garden entrance. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elias’s elegiac lexicon. Occasional loftiness (“unkindled solace”) edges toward poetic overlay but remains consistent with grief-stricken cognition, keeping voice distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tightly glued to Liora’s perceptual filter—wax “softening under her touch,” rope “as if alive.” Syntax is calm, methodical, mirroring her archivist rhythm; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Ryn; perceptual signature favors sonic and tactile detail over visual catalog. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into short clauses during escape, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “ripple-mark mapkeeper” and “bloom of hush,” both character-specific. Register remains ice-bound and ritual without drifting into generic fantasy cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s diction—“shard of hush,” “taste of old rain”—creating a perceptual signature that is elegiac, slightly archaic, yet precise. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for memory, staccato for the climb and final laugh. No dialogue, so voice convergence is moot. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory detail is immediate. The wind-scraped glass song becomes a refrain that mirrors his internal drone without overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is lyrical yet precise—“ink that smelled of sun-warmed meadows and distant thunder.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for wonder, staccato clicks for forward motion. No head-hopping; register consistent. One clause edges toward over-flower (“weight of centuries, thick as the fog…”) but fits accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature—smell of kerosene, flame greed, stone pulse. Syntax mirrors fireworks rhythm: long fuse-like sentences build, then short sparks at ignition. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence is maintained through interior chant and sensory filter.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, modulating from lyrical wide shots to the haptic “pulse thrumming in her throat.” Perceptual signature—salt crystals, hermit-crab hesitation—belongs unmistakably to a chronicler who reads minutiae as narrative. Syntax breathes with tidal rhythm; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. One clause drifts toward editorial abstraction (“trying to discover the texture of time”) but is immediately re-grounded in sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays inside Liora’s perceptual signature—ozone-tasting air, starched hush—without ever ventriloquizing the boy. Syntax stretches with syrupy air, then tightens when gravity re-asserts; rhythm mirrors altitude. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Voice is singular enough that two lines could not come from another story.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature (pressure shifts, lantern gleams on water); syntax lengthens and shortens with the gondola’s glide.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited voice is consistent, lyric, and filtered through a tech-archivist’s eye: “cracked lenses,” “ozone and old magic.” Syntax flexes—long breathy sentences for wonder, clipped fragments for discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to the keeper’s perceptual filter—“starlight spilled like silver dust,” “lungs expanding as if for the first time”—maintaining rhythmic control and distinct texture; no dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal cadence modulates with rising breath beats.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature filters world through scam-reflex (“system was rigged”) and fungal otherness. Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences early, clipped clauses during portal beat—mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice carries all differentiation; it succeeds. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“he wondered if…”) but immediacy recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“sepia reading room exhaled,” “bridge of intuition”) feels idiosyncratic to Elias’s antiquarian sensibility without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Aldric; perceptual signature is war-bleached and tactile (“gauntlets scraping against the flagstones”). Syntax lengthens under duress, then fractures into short beats at the hoist, mirroring the loss of motor control. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature filters world through archival melancholy (“yellowed paper and old glue”).

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited stays tight to Lira; perceptual signature favors light-fracture imagery and tactical cataloging (“coins in a beggar’s cup”). Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated but consistent with a reflective rebel. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay within POV lexicon. Final image of golden path maintains cadence without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s perceptions; diction (“spectral shards,” “vested hush”) is consistent with a musician’s synesthetic bent. Rhythm swells and contracts with breath and phrase length, teaching its pattern early. No dialogue appears, so voice purity remains unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Liora’s perceptual bias—precise, taxonomic, slightly cold—until the syntax softens in the final paragraph (“edges softened, her movements slower”) to mirror transformation. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for twilight hush, clipped fragments for dust revelation. Distinctiveness stops just shy of the 9-band because the voice never risks an idiosyncratic metaphor that could only be hers.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited stays latched to Elias; perceptual signature favors gears, salt-worn brass, mist—consistent tinkerer lexicon. Syntax modulates from short declarative in workshop to longer, liquid cadence under the fall, mirroring immersion. No dialogue, so voice carries all; the final “Uncertainty was not the enemy” risks a touch of maxim, but the line is earned by the preceding sensory rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays inside Liora’s perceptual signature—alchemy-as-attention: puddles reflect “fractured glow,” ore is “unrefined,” breath is “ragged” when emotion peaks. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fragments when she sees her name, mirroring shock. No head-hop; Elias’s interior is legible only through observable hollows and voice fatigue. Register remains consistent—arcane yet tactile—without drifting into faux-archaic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays tight to Liora; perceptual signature is translator-synesthetic (“stories slipped between worlds like mist through cracks”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadence in market pools, clipped fragments during wrist-hum. No head-hopping; alchemist and artist speak only when on-stage. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. One near-slip: “elusively tangible” risks thesis-statement, but context absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains a restrained technician’s perceptual signature—flashlight angles, gear teeth, dust spirals—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax breathes with Mira’s steady pulse; no dialogue means voice coherence rests on tactile diction and it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: he traces spines, reads frost constellations, hears “rustling awakenings” as warnings. Syntax lengthens under pressure—“He had spent lifetimes compressing eternity into a moment”—then fractures into shorter clauses during collapse, mirroring glass splinters. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction belongs to a man who tastes ink and infinity. Distinct rhythmic control and consistent perceptual signature meet the 9-band threshold with only a hairline slip of abstract summary (“he understood”).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s poet-perceiver: “light fractured through the shard” is idiosyncratic noticing. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for nostalgia, staccato during ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “his teeth ache,” “his breath ragged.” Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into short gasps, mirroring pressure.

Filter verbs are minimal; free indirect slips are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s loom-born, scent-biased perceptual field; syntax lengthens and breathes as he descends, then compresses when the figure surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter; diction (“umbral tenderness,” “honeyed beams”) mirrors her artist’s gaze without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences contract to single decisive clause at final brushstroke. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Free-indirect cue (“she understood then, not with her mind…”) is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, filtering perception through Elias’s linguistic ear: “words curling into the air like smoke.” Syntax lengthens with Old Sumerian cadence, then fractures into whispers on playback, mirroring the accumulative pressure. No head-hopping; the city’s voice is kept external until the final chorus, preserving focal discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Liora’s sensory field; perceptual signature is botanical (“downy feathers,” “loam,” “stubborn soil”).

Diction stays within her artisanal lexicon (“grain of the cathedral bell rope”).

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: dust motes, metal sighs, fractured constellations. Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under alarm, mirroring breath. No dialogue to test voice divergence; internal diction remains consistent with self-taught astronomer-janitor. Minor elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing”) occur in narration, not interiority, so register holds.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptions; diction is spare, cadence slow, mirroring his tranquil vigil. No dialogue, so voice carries all differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual gear-grind and synesthetic time-sense; diction (“frayed edges in the dust,” “air thickened into honey”) is consistent and rhythmic. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is high; one clause of abstract self-diagnosis—“by curse, by the weight of seconds”—slips toward label-speak but is immediately re-grounded in tactile image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person intimate sustains a burnished, tidal rhythm; diction (“hammered metal,” “lace of tide”) remains within Mira’s perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited voice is steady, quiet, arborist-precise: “testing its tension,” “mimicked the natural flow.” Rhythm lengthens toward dusk, mirroring fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual bandwidth—his ribs feel the amber, his eyes read copper shimmer as threat. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“a binding of elements long separated”) then fractures at the moment of surrender.

Syntax lengthens and contracts with duskfall, mirroring tide rhythm. No dialogue appears; voice remains consistent without head-hop. Diction edges toward lit-speak (“submerged concord,” “conceptual repricing”) but stays within a coachman-poet’s plausible lexicon, so only a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited clings to Elias’s tracker sensorium: “nose leading,” “wind like thousand voices,” “wax sealing in scent.” Syntax lengthens in dread, then fractures during playback—“voice warping into something almost inhuman.” No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture; the absence is purposeful and does not harm.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches Elias’s out-of-sync perception; diction (“frozen breath against the void”) stays within his poetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences stretch, then shorten at the anomaly beat—mirroring temporal warping without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature alone, which remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)

Distinctive cadence taught early and sustained to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—mercury taste, tooth-ache language, texture-divining—and modulates rhythm: longer clauses while reading, staccato fragments during descent.

Rhythm modulates: long sentences for frozen village, clipped fragments inside memory corridor. No head-hopping; Liora’s voice enters as external apparition, not POV breach. Filter verbs serve voice—“the air hum like a plucked harp string”—rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, tracking Lira’s artist perceptions (“jagged ivory curves,” “palette of warnings”). Syntax lengthens during poetic surges, then fractures at peaks to mirror echo-breaks; diction stays within her aesthetic lexicon. Echo’s dialogue carries mischievous indirection suited to name. No head-hop; POV stable. Final line lands with rhythmic snap: “She had a truth to shatter first.”

    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s sensory filter; diction—“spectral fingers,” “quilt of half-remembered dreams”—is consistent with an alchemist-poet mind. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses build dread, then staccato scrambling accelerates at recognition. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is painterly—edges, cobalt, gull-wing curves. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences contract into lunging clauses as shell sinks. No head-hop; diction remains within an aging coastal artisan’s lexicon. One clause “regret in his bones” flirts with cliché but is earned by salt-beard context.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature—vibration through bones, scent as memory-ghost—without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s patched-coat perception; diction favors maritime rust and harbor silt, rhythm lengthens under moonlight then shortens on ring tone.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s perceptual filter: “colors too vivid, sounds too crisp” under glass. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures—“She tore the eye free, her hands shaking”—matching pulse. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice-drift penalties. Free indirect thought is clean, and diction never exceeds her self-taught forager lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure meets the 9- gate; only absence of spoken lines keeps it just below.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual bandwidth; diction—“ghostly fingers,” “tuning-fork hum”—is salted with maritime idiom.

Purposeful elision of stranger’s backstory is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual map: coastline “color of old tea,” chip grooves “etched with tiny, precise ridges.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under choice; no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction alone—sufficiently idiosyncratic to avoid generic antique-shop cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet precise diction—“wind tugging at her robes like a restless child,” “grotto yawned.” Syntax lengthens during ascent, then fragments at the mirror touch, mirroring breathless thin air.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is dense, rhythmic, and chronicler-specific—“feral nostalgia,” “mountain’s teeth”—without purple drift. Compression (“lucid dream chronicler” as sole epithet) is taught early and holds. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. POV stays interior and coherent; perceptual signature (ink bleeding, maps never sold) is consistent. Under peak stress diction shortens to “The latch clicked,” mirroring pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound of drops, feel of brass.

Syntax lengthens in reflection, shortens in action (“She dipped. The ink crystallized.”) without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue, so voice modulation rests in rhythmic breath units and selective metaphor. Register stays within a rune-scholar’s lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—smell of glue, fogged lenses, trembling breath—syntax lengthens with memory, shortens under voltage. Metaphorical diction (‘static and spite’, ‘waltz that sounded like falling’) is consistent with his exorcist-radio idiom. No head-hopping; curator dialogue is sparse and utilitarian, preserving voice monopoly. Compression in the final paragraph—‘he didn’t look back’—earns its brevity after textured buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and cadence; diction (“spiral arbitration,” “resounding hush”) is elevated but stays within Elara’s scholarly register.

    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s probability-tuned perception; diction (“clover melancholy,” “lucid contradictions”) is character-specific rather than writerly flourish. Rhythm accelerates into short, staccato observations as the lantern flares, mirroring the white-hot reveal without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual bias: she notices damp concrete, ozone, the way spirals “seemed to move when she wasn’t looking.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, then compresses—“She just said, ‘Good.’” Dialogue is sparse, indirect, and goal-driven; callers plead, Mara deflects. No filter-verb clusters; the prose breathes with her metabolic rhythm. Voice remains singular, never editorial.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited remains tightly latched to Elias’s perceptions; salt, creaking wood, and locket weight are rendered in his quiet archivist idiom. Rhythm modulates from long, breath-held sentences to the short release of “The locket slipped…”—a deliberate cadence shift under peak stress. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are N/A. One clause—“as if she had already seen the water rising”—edges toward authorial omniscience, but the illusion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—he notices frayed cuffs, pigeon motion, the rock’s “frozen starlight” shard. Syntax tightens under stress: clauses shorten when the logistician turns away. Dialogue is minimal but voice-differentiated: Elias’s forced jocularity (“Trains don’t run on time here”) contrasts with the logistician’s dry paper tone. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; psychic distance compresses exactly as desperation peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is perceptually signature: vibration-as-language, constellations that “pause,” compass warmth read through skin.

Diction is precise: “stillwater tension,” “bruised evening sky,” never purple. Girl’s dialogue is spare and child-true, contrasting with lyric narration without register drift. One hairline slip: “metronome to her thoughts” edges toward cliché, but cadence recovers instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is hushed, slightly archaic, consistent with a man who hears what others only breathe. Syntax lengthens and contracts with Elias’s attention—short clauses under stress, lyrical rolls when memory overtakes him. No dialogue appears, so the interior monologue must carry idiom; it does, avoiding filter verbs and therapy-speak. The only slippage is one line—“something older, something hungry”—that edges toward generic horror cadence.

Register remains elevated yet consistent with a poet who experiences the world as half-finished verse.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person stays latched to Elias’s sensorium: “eyes, useless for distinguishing hues,” “spectrum he couldn’t name.” Syntax is lean, tactile, slightly compressed—no filter-verb clutter. Mara and Liora speak sparingly; when they do, diction differentiates (Mara’s kiln jargon vs. Liora’s barter idiom).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—dying-whale facility, syrupy air, teeth-aching chant; diction is controlled, rhythmic, and rises into compressed lyricism without losing clarity; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is textured and consistent: crushed-mint air, arrowhead “pressing like a promise,” static that “crackles with voices that aren’t quite voices.” Syntax stays controlled under pressure; no head-hop or register drift. A hair more idiosyncrasy in Maren’s brief speech could have nudged 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—wood grain, silver pulse, caramel scent—syntax lengthens and compresses with carousel tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and softens during the song, mirroring breath control; short clauses return at the tremble, a rhythmic echo of fatigue. Diction stays rural-metaphoric—“gnarled,” “runoff,” “wind chimes”—never drifts into academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)

Syntax breathes with the hush-tone: long vowels, sibilants, controlled caesuras. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction and cadence; it never flattens into editorial gloss. Under peak pressure the diction compresses—“She would not take it”—a clean stylistic heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual map: selective attention to angles, dust, etched glass. Syntax lengthens with wonder (“its sails catching a wind that hadn’t been on any map”) yet stays within apprentice lexicon. No dialogue to test voice split; internal diction is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound of frost, metallic taste of oil—and modulates rhythm: long clauses for wonder, staccato for gear clicks. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Diction remains within locksmith lexicon; “vial,” “teeth,” “bridge” carry double duty. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” notion feels academic for the lyric texture, but it surfaces only in final sentence and reads as conscious elevation rather than lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person ghost POV remains stable, perceptual signature soft and horticultural (“watered the flowers in her own way”).

No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal, indirect, goal-driven (“Follow the nuts”). Rhythm mirrors stealth: long sensory clauses, then staccato orders. One clause edges toward poetic overwrite (“branches heavy with fruit that would never ripen”) but remains within POV’s bleak lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lina’s perceptual lens—polymer jargon, tactile earth, foam geometry.

No filter-verb stacks or register drift; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)

Occasional elevated diction (“avalanchingly,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges against POV lexicon but remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at Elias’s shoulder, filtering every image through his synesthetic labor—ink smells of copper, choir hum vibrates teeth. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments, em-dashes, and rhythmic repetitions mimic the press’s clank and the fragment’s rising frequency. Borrowed voices are italicized only once each, then absorbed into free indirect discourse, keeping psychic distance controlled. No head-hop; the woman’s interiority is withheld, her coat-color tag doing all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual lag: sentences lengthen, verbs soften (“gripped reality loosely”). No head-hopping; dialogue sparse, idiomatically plain. One register drift: “euthanasia tourist” feels academic against the lyric texture, but it is introduced early and reused, so the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays close to Liora’s tactile attention; perceptual signature is consistent—“breath fogging the window,” “calloused fingers.” Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped dialogue under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the walker’s perceptual signature—driftwood mask, peripheral vision, sand-pulse heartbeat—with rhythmic control that accelerates into the final thread beat. No head-hopping or register drift. Syntax mirrors attention: long clauses for dunes, fragments for peripheral flickers. Distinctive without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: dew, petal texture, light angles. Syntax lengthens during contemplation then tightens into the single transitive clause “He placed it” at the pivot, giving rhythmic poise. No head-hop; diction remains within his quiet lexicon. The dove’s coo is rendered through his interpretation, maintaining distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound-colour synaesthesia, bibliophilic diction (“spines he had long since memorized”). Rhythm modulates with experiment: short declaratives under crystal pulse, longer reflective cadences in library hush. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under peak sensory overload. Distinctive without mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that stays interior to the prophet; perceptual signature favors auditory metaphors (“thin as a reed,” “static silence”) consistent with his sonic obsession.

Voice remains distinct and purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual sieve: “luminous ache,” “sound of a leaf falling” are his idiom, not editorial. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under collapse; no template cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from tactile repair to cosmic awe. Experimental compression (“time itself grown impatient”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s musician sensorium—sound of strings, scent of lavender, feel of vinyl—no head-hop. Syntax lengthens during the lullaby, then shortens at the shard exchange, mirroring pulse. Diction remains within his lexicon; no poetic inflation. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, and voice-distinct: Lena’s teasing “You heard me” against Elias’s swallowed “Anything.” One clause drifts slightly toward editorial—“the quiet assurance of someone who had done this before”—holding it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is light but consistent—brass eyepiece, rune etchings, ozone scent filtered through scholar-bent attention. No head-hopping. Syntax modulates from measured descent to short release at shatter moment. Voice avoids generic fantasy cadence; diction stays within rune-scholar lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The free-indirect voice carries a restrained lyric cadence (“rules of the world bent like willow branches”) that stays within Lena’s perceptual range; diction never drifts into academic or corporate register. Compression is purposeful: “She kept it not for luck, but for proof” distills motive in one stroke. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptions; diction (“ink resisted his touch,” “sentences half-formed”) mirrors a writer’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long, mist-laden clauses to staccato exchanges with apparitions, echoing rising urgency. No dialogue beyond two terse questions, yet each line carries subtext—absent kite, accusatory sketch—serving as action. Voice remains distinct and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s tinkerer eye: light fractures into rainbows, spirals “match.” Syntax lengthens during song, then shortens to breathless “giddy and breathless,” mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; perceptual signature is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—breath plumes, calloused fingers, spider-slow motions. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic patience; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensory register—calloused fingers, prism-fractured lamplight—creating a perceptual signature of jeweled minutiae. Syntax lengthens and softens during the epiphany, mirroring the release of tension without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the narrative diction never drifts above the character’s artisan lexicon. One clause—“the lull of the wounded one”—leans writerly rather than character-bound, a micro wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—cold brass, blue-hungry flame, thorn-barbs—syntax lengthens then compresses with her inhale/exhale rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the single neologism “boundary-lessly” is pattern-taught by the shadows’ behavior and repaid when the hush reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile (thumb on grain, steam curls). Syntax modulates: long reflective sentences build to short blade strokes. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon except “rust-hued,” forgiven by closure absorption. Rhythm mirrors emotional crest without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“rusted platform,” “frayed thread”) stays inside the scavenger’s worn vernacular. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for foggy rumination, clipped fragments at ghost encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters decay through engineering eyes—“calculating load-bearing points,” “equations in the way water carved stone.” Syntax modulates from long lyrical openings to clipped discoveries (“Her breath caught.”), supporting stoic wonder without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elias’s perceptual bias—clock-oil skin, auditory narrowing to ticking—no head-hop. Syntax mirrors his meticulosity: balanced clauses, gear-like cadence. No dialogue from Elias, so voice distinction test is waived; girl’s brief speech is child-simple, appropriate. Filter verbs are minimal, used only when they signal his evaluative pause (“he thought of…”). One micro drift: “the world still wrapped in the hush” momentarily cosmic, but immediately re-anchors to his skin-level cold.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice carries a dusk-lit, legend-haunted cadence—“lanterns flickering like dying stars,” “ghost of ink long dried”—yet stays within the seeker’s perceptual range. Syntax lengthens and compresses with tension; the final beats shorten to single clauses. No head-hopping; focalization is locked tight. The occasional elevated phrase (“architecture of those lies”) is earned by prior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—patient, salt-smelling, synesthetic. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic infinite patience, then contracts at the flicker in the water. No head-hopping or register drift; fulgurite and rope carry consistent sensory idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Lena’s fatigue-filtered perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“autumn’s breath curled…too tired to finish”).

Register stays within ruined-aristocrat lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—shattered-glass mind, flickering lantern heart. Syntax tightens under pressure: breath shallow, pulse metronome.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers close to Elias with perceptual signature—petals “shiver like wind-touched leaves,” a simile only a sentimentalist would choose.

Compression (“He had watched empires…”) is taught early and paid off in the final blur of gold streaks.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: chisel-scrape as prayer, lavender as temporal slip. Syntax lengthens and breathes with meditative cadence, then shortens at the whispered line—“His breath caught”—mirroring cardiac skip. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the free-indirect “wondered if grief had a shape” keeps psychic distance consistent. The final public recitation retains the same measured cadence, proving voice can carry outward without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Elias’s sensory filter: “leather worn thin,” “waves hissed like dying embers,” “pulse of the mechanism.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then compresses during the climb, mirroring emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within a clock-keeper’s lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure satisfy the 9-band quick test, held back only by a slight uniformity of sentence openings in the mid-section.

The final sentence lands with cadential certainty without slipping into editorial uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elias’s sensory filter; diction is lean, rhythmic, with occasional lyric lift (“gallery stretched like a wound”). No head-hop; psychic distance contracts cleanly during mask vision. The voice never editorializes beyond what grief permits.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is erudite, salt-corroded, and consistent (“waterlogged parchment,” “rusted blades”). Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses at the exit beat, mirroring tension. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose texture itself characterizes. One filter-verb cluster (“he realized how little…”) slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person stays tightly aligned to Elias’s perceptual filter: static-heavy air, the box “warm as if it had absorbed the storm’s fury,” nectar dusk tasted rather than seen. Syntax flexes with pressure—“truth clawed up his throat”—without losing clarity. Maren’s dialogue carries steel-edged subtext that forces Elias’s hand. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” diction in narration feels above Elias’s pay-grade, but it is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature (“cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling”) is distinct. Rhythm modulates—long languid clauses mimic held breath, then staccato fragments (“The house stopped.”) under stress. No dialogue, so voice remains pure and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV stays tight to the diver; perception narrows to helmet glass, gloved fingers, violet shimmer—distinctive, pressure-responsive. Syntax lengthens under watery drag, then fractures into short clauses as glass breaks, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; statue’s telepathy is cleanly framed as external intrusion. Voice never explains what the scene already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)

    Third-person POV hovers close to the painter, with perceptual signature rooted in tactile art process: “fingers trembling not from fatigue but from the weight of the calligrapher’s moon-tipped brush.” Syntax lengthens during painting beats, then contracts at decision moments; rhythm mirrors breath. No head-hopping; diction stays within an artist’s lexicon. Filter verbs serve lyric distance rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent lyric-fabulist: aged-parchment diction, hush of water, rosewater dread. Syntax modulates—long breath for myth, short pulse for bee-hum—without losing clarity. POV stays tight third, no leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is clockmaker-precise, compressed, salt-rusted: “his clocks run backward… time itself stutter.” Syntax shortens under pressure—“He gasped as the world *reversed*.” No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent, even through cosmic rewind. A hairline slip: “bleak and exhilarated” labels the final smile; trimming the adjectives would let the image speak and nudge this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors metallic, ocular, saccharine textures that feel idiosyncratic to Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—spiral shells, salt scent, pattern whispers. Syntax lengthens during descent, then fragments as she runs, mirroring pulse.

Reed whistle motif is seeded but never acoustically returns, a small missed voice beat; still, rhythmic control under pressure is evident.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Voss’s perceptual filter—spectacle fog, penknife grip, warmth of gold leaf—creating a consistent scholarly-brittle diction. No head-hopping; Liora’s interior is accessed only through her spoken lines and Voss’s inference. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for archival obsession, clipped exchanges under threat. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” feel) appears in the penultimate paragraph, but it stays within an academic POV’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual lens: mortar felt “with fingers,” ink “thick, almost tar-like.” Syntax lengthens under melancholy, shortens during prying stones, mirroring emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Veyra’s perceptual filter—soot, solder, jasmine, moonstone dust—creating a rhythmic, metallic-jasmine cadence distinct to the piece. No head-hopping; priestly offerings are seen only as unexplained externals, preserving her narrowed lens. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer accumulative clauses build the garden calm, then fracture into short beats at the shatter. Voice remains consistent even under the final possession, the last clause stripped to “the world transformed.”

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Lena’s perceptual sieve: rust groans “like a dying beast,” geode heat “pools in the hollows of her bones.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments (“She had minutes.”) mimic shallow breath. No head-hop; scientist-ghost is purely external flicker. Diction stays within her lexicon until “perturbation theory” intrudes via log-whisper, justified as found text. Rhythmic control is purposeful: longer clauses for nostalgia, staccato for reboot panic. Voice is distinct, consistent, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through nautical and astral lexicon. Syntax lengthens under melancholy, shortens at the toss: rhythmic control matches pressure. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction alone, which holds.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyrical close-up maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“coincidences felt less like chance and more like fate”) stays within Elias’s poetic lexicon.

    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: frayed hat, salt scent, stitch tension.

    Perceptual signature is immaculate: Liora notices tears’ shimmer, gravity’s slackening, photograph textures—all filtered through embodied pacifism. Rhythm modulates from drifting languor to taut stitching beats, then serene float. No head-hopping; single POV sustained with lyrical compression that pays off at closure. Diction (“ghosts of forgotten lives,” “needle of light”) is voice-motivated, never academic or ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s weary lyricism (“coincidences felt less like chance and more like fate”). Syntax compresses under stress (“He ran.”) without losing voice. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—the woman’s “sad” smile contrasts Elias’s denial—and avoids exposition. No head-hopping; focalization remains coherent even during the mirror vision, which reads as hallucinatory pressure, not omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is impeccably controlled—single, close third with Mira’s perceptual signature (noticing runes, lock mechanics, shadow-play). Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during intrusion (“The door creaked”), then expand lyrically at climax (“leaving the torch where it would be found”). Diction stays within her lexicon (“tumbler,” “false keyhole”); no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythmic control heightens tension without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is exquisite: Elias notices ripples, not eels; feels hums, not theories. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences early; taut fragments during ritual (“He laid the first rock... second... third”). Voice remains consistent even in lyric abstraction (“ribbons of green and violet weaving through salt-stiff air”). No head-hopping; single POV filters every image through embodied intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s poetic, censored sensibility—every observation tinged with metaphor (“spine of a book he could not yet read”) yet grounded in concrete sensation. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; fragmented urgency during the timer’s beep. No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature—noticing scars as geography, storms as silence-breakers—is consistent and character-specific, elevating prose beyond decoration into worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly bound to Elias’s perception, filtering every detail through his philosopher’s precision and embodied prosthetic awareness. Voice modulates under pressure: short, gear-like sentences during tension (“The needle card trembled”) contrast lyrical flow in reflection. Dialogue crackles with subtext—Isolde’s “You’ve been studying me” accuses and invites—and distinct lexicons (her surgical diction vs. his cartographic metaphors) never converge artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is luminous yet precise—syntax shortens under pressure (“The key fit… with a click that echoed like a gunshot”), diction stays within Lumen’s poetic lexicon (“skeletal ribs,” “blooming resistance”). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices margins, textures, light. Dialogue distinguishes Elias (pragmatic, weathered) from Lumen (hesitant, lyrical) without convergence. No head-hopping; single POV holds tightly even in memory shards.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s poetic yet precise perception (“branches thick as ancient ship masts,” “laughter still echoing”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short, fragmented clauses during the encore (“He played on… The arbor groaned”) contrast lyrical opening. Voice remains consistent—no register drift, no head-hopping despite multiple characters. The prose itself performs the story’s tension between structure (piano scales) and rupture (discordant finale).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices glyphs, pulses, shifts in light—details filtered through her role as reality checker. Voice modulates under pressure (shorter sentences at climax), and prose rhythm mirrors the ridge’s hum. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Nani’s wind-like voice contrasts Liora’s internal tension. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose voice is distinctively Elias’s: measured cadence, tactile focus, botanical lexicon (“miniature maple,” “gnarled roots”), and restrained emotion mirror his profession. Psychic distance remains tight; no head-hopping. Syntax varies purposefully—long, fluid sentences for reflection; short clauses for action (“He knelt.” “He exhaled.”). Elision (e.g., unspecified students) is motivated and paid off through emotional resonance, not confusion.
