    The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("luminous glass artist," "wind threading stone throats," "paused breath now reclaimed") that remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction during peak moments—"breath on cracked glass: steady, adaptive, refusing to vanish" and "drifting resonance of their fear"—where more concrete embodiment would sharpen pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and the POV remains stable in third-person limited with no head-hopping. Sentence rhythms modulate with scene needs, yet several metaphors strain coherence: "flames licking the rafters like wolves tasting blood" mixes vehicle and tenor awkwardly. The piece teaches its patterned, compressed cadence early and holds it, but the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (the hollow, the bus) occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the protagonist's immediate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual filter mostly consistent (acoustic scientist vocabulary, tuning-fork precision). Diction is distinct and lyric-mode compression is purposeful in lines like "unshaken marvels of music, stripped of their noise." However, register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure: "silently expressive" appears twice as phrase-tag, and "rectangle of thermal song" / "composing in the new language she had been born to translate" read as authorial assertion rather than Mara's exact idiom. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance is stable (tight third) and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register with rhythmic control ("a morse of moonlit bubbles," "chased stillness," "bruised glimmers"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the undertaker filters the library through mortuary idiom (souls as "overdue fines," catalog entries for the dead). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism that feels authored rather than character-bound ("occupying impossible spaces," "interval between heartbeats when the dearly departed almost speak"). No dialogue is present, so no dialogue-specific issues. The prose remains legible and purposeful throughout, with free indirect style cleanly managed, though peak compression at closure ("chased stillness") is taught too late to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates purposefully between close interior and wider valley perspective. Diction is controlled—"censored stars," "contraband salt," "unbanned prayer"—though several phrases ("gently persistent," "amplified quiet") repeat as labels rather than varying the perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the boy's line about the bell remembering names and Lita's warning about rationed memories advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the arbor and the final ridge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent focalization through the pilgrim. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("foggy lucidity," "petals clustering around his heart like moths") that feels purposeful and voice-motivated. The man's single line of dialogue ("I lost the address of the love I never gave; the map they issued burns if held too long") reads ornate and abstracted rather than natural speech, straining credibility. Psychic distance modulates intentionally during the breath-matching ritual, and the perceptual signature (spiritual curiosity filtering detail through scent and breath) remains character-specific. Minor filter-verb stacking in reflective passages ("she understood then," "she felt the fracture") slightly dulls immediacy without collapsing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: the designer notices sap pulse, emulsion surrender, bark softening "like photographic paper." Diction matches an artist's sensibility (Möbius ribbons, hyperbolic arrays, asymptotic hedges). Psychic distance tightens during the hawthorn encounter, where syntax compresses ("She tugged, and the ring ripped free; the garden shuddered"). Minor register drift: "retrocognitively trapped" and "helical well of causality" edge toward exposition rather than felt experience, though they remain within a designer's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the narrator's detached, ceremonial perspective. Dialogue (the ringmaster's line) feels purposeful and distinct. However, the prose leans heavily on figurative compression ("patient as drought-grass," "articulated absence," "seeds…singing") that occasionally obscures immediacy—e.g., "footprints that spelled the same minor seventh in dust" strains credibility. Perceptual signature is present but static; the voice does not modulate under peak pressure (guard confrontation reads at the same poetic register as the opening).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; perceptual signature (hearing colors, translating heat to chord) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism—"battered marvel of a note," "bruised pearl"—that feels more authorial than character-bound under stress. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue present except keeper's single line, which reads natural and goal-driven. Some filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Voice modulates with pressure but retains ornamental texture throughout rather than compressing under crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the thief; distance modulates appropriately with her discovery. Diction is elevated and lyric ("ribbon of pale light," "moth wings," "destiny breathing back") but remains coherent. The hooded woman's dialogue ("Show me," "My husband died before I could memorize his face") is functional but undistinguished; her rasp and the cigarette-that-never-ashes are vivid details. Perceptual signature is present but generic: the thief reads pulses, recognizes inscriptions, listens to destiny. One recycled stem: "illuminated moment(s)" appears six times, becoming a thematic anchor but also a crutch. Register remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters through Mara's glassblowing expertise (molten threads, translucence, curvature) and grief-informed selectivity. Her dramatic narration ("Behold, the pilgrim unscrews...") is voice-motivated and serves emotional function—steadying hands, warming her heart. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; elevated moments ("cartographer charts a country no larger than a skull") read as her narration voice, not authorial intrusion. Minor deduction: "thoughtfully spirited" in the glass-response moment is slightly register-elevated for peak stress, though it's brief and could read as her narration mode continuing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: industry idiom ("call for places," "color-grade," "betray the frame"), stunt-beat counting, and a rhythm that modulates with stress (short clauses during the decrypt, longer reflection in the denouement). The child's dialogue ("Only to people who listen scared") reads slightly arch for naturalistic speech but fits the fable-like atmosphere. Filter verbs ("I recognized," "I lifted") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent: Leo notices gels, autographs, projector mechanics. One weakness: diction occasionally elevates beyond Leo's panic in peak moments—"palimpsest," "transformative betrayal," "Charged Poise" feel imported rather than character-bound—creating minor register drift under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct and internally consistent, with a lyric compression that matches the oracle's perceptual mode: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "doors opening onto the same door." Diction remains controlled and character-particular throughout. Two frictions: the delayed footsteps ("her own, delayed and misplaced") introduce a surreal element without clear anchoring, risking a brief POV leak, and some passages ("latitude of last lullaby, longitude of unopened farewell") push toward ornamental lyricism that slightly obscures spatial and causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on J4N-17 with consistent perceptual signature: optical sensors, titanium fingers, neural architecture. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register—"remarkably composed," "amalgamate," "coalescing"—that feels author-imposed rather than robot-specific. Sentence stems repeat: "In loop X, J4N-17 had..." and "The robot's..." across multiple paragraphs. Psychic distance is controlled but the voice lacks distinct texture under pressure; crisis and calm sound identical.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds Mira's perspective cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("the timeframe after words become unnecessary," "ambiguously clear") that fits the hushed, reflective forecourt. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext when present. Two frictions lower the score: several lines compress metaphor and elevated diction in ways that strain voice plausibility for a night registrar under stress ("a funeral march for resentment," "the resonant hush returning, deeper now, like a chord resolved"), and Rico/Jun's brief exchange, while functional, does not yet establish distinct idiom. Psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with perceptual signature filtered through Elara's professional attention (noting hedge shifts, soil-borne secrets, bloom states). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak moments: "ancient negotiation between human intention and vegetative will," "understanding of probability transcended human mathematics." The prose texture relies on repeated sentence stems ("She understood," "Elara understood," "she understood then") that flatten voice under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent but the diction occasionally exceeds what the focalizer would frame mid-crisis. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent (mechanically warm, twilight routine, obligation to the sky). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "obliging sky mechanic," "chilled honey," "reluctant imago," "sideways time." No head-hopping. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (nexus pulse, projections, moth-bat song) and tilts present stance via micro-choices (lowering the lever, stepping back). Purposeful compression ("three against five," "icy warmth") is taught and legible. Minor slip: "mechanically warm" recurs frequently enough to approach tic, though it remains voice-motivated and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited throughout, with consistent focalization on the musician. The voice carries a literary register that suits the opera-house setting, though it occasionally drifts toward abstract elevation ("liminal existence," "thematic question") that feels more like commentary than the character's lived perception. Psychic distance is controlled, but filter verbs ("he understood," "he realized") cluster in key beats without adding subtext or tension. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. Perceptual signature is present but generic—the musician notices obvious symbolic elements (water, program images) without a character-specific bias or sensory hierarchy that would distinguish this consciousness from another.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature consistent: the oracle filters through her oracular talent (peripheral vision, swaying certainties, instruments' whispered names). Diction stays within her register—"chlorophyll sorrow," "auroral light," "rosary beads counting down"—mixing botanical, meteorological, and mystical vocabularies without jarring shifts. Purposeful compression in the fever-memory and stranger-arrival beats serves closure momentum. Minor filter-verb accumulation ("she felt," "she remembered") in early paragraphs slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure focalization. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with the expulsion's physical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is controlled and distinctive: "religiously skeptical to the marrow," "appraise it by touch, by smell," "secular, unproved, yet weighty" anchor Mara's intellectual-skeptic idiom. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts high under pressure—"weighted with something sloshing inside its hollow spokes" and "drowsy alertness sharpening into a hunter's sway" feel elevated for peak-stress immediacy. The brother's off-page radio voice and the psychics' frantic refrain are summarized exposition rather than dramatized dialogue, missing subtext opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited tracking the chronicle keeper; no head-hopping. Psychic distance and narrative stance are consistent, though somewhat elevated and lyric throughout. The prose carries a distinct, heightened texture ("pool beneath the stone like breath held too long," "drift of untold seasons") that reads as purposeful voice rather than generic literary register. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract, therapy-adjacent phrasing ("letting silence regenerate in the wounds left by ink") that fits the lyric mode but risks losing perceptual particularity. The keeper's way of noticing—filtering detail through archival and textual metaphors—is consistent but does not degrade or sharpen under the stress of transformation; the voice at the ending remains as composed as at the start. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean where used, but the piece leans heavily on narrated perception rather than embodied micro-actions that would anchor voice in body and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and the perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices tempo, sonic linkage, and memory-texture in character-specific ways. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cautious exuberance," "irreversibly linked," "древloping") that strains the music therapist's lexicon under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the ridge inhale," "felt their gazes climb") cluster in the eclipse beat without voice-motivation. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates with scene pressure but lacks the syntactic variety and rhythmic control expected at higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the historian notices "tremor of old narratives," "bronze quiet," "threads tightening like muscles remembering." Diction remains consistent and elevated without slipping into therapy-speak. Minor friction: a few phrases ("the only creature still driven," "odd even among the remaining archivists") edge toward expository convenience rather than embodied perception, and some metaphoric density ("scream that had decided to stay") occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Chen; perceptual signature is consistent (light as shutter, wind as score, island as instrument). Diction elevates purposefully ("lithophone," "Fresnel lens," "combers") to match Chen's cryptic register, though occasional phrases ("accidentally prophetic," "familiar enigma") veer toward prompt-label phrasing. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven ("You still write those cookies, Chen?" / "Ever think the light talks?"), and carries subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during departure. Brief convergence: the keeper's speech and Chen's both lean poetic under the beam's influence, but the effect reads intentional rather than voice collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person with priest-focalized perception. The perceptual signature—"silence as ornament," "absence can illuminate"—is consistent and voice-motivated. However, heavy figurative density in nearly every sentence creates a uniform elevated register that sometimes obscures immediate perception: "a rosary of clicks," "chiasmus that crossed belief and doubt like strangers on a bridge at dusk," "unraveled stillness." Purposeful compression is present and the pattern is taught, but at peak beats (demon's arrival, priest's sacrifice) the diction does not modulate with urgency; it maintains the same lyric distance. Psychic distance is intentionally remote, fitting the conceptual design, but embodied perception suffers under the metaphorical load.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a poetic, compression-heavy voice ("upturned hush," "palimpsest of birthdays," "sub-audible B-flat"). Perceptual signature is lyric and metaphor-dense but consistent. Distance control holds, though the narration occasionally drifts into convenient omniscience (claiming the lake "proved" it was a score, or that the nautilus "had waited since Devonian tides"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early, yet the density of figurative language in nearly every sentence flattens propulsion during high-pressure beats. Register remains elevated throughout; no filter-verb stacks or voice convergence, but also no modulation under stress—syntax stays ornate even when exhaustion hits.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is ambitious and controlled: a distinct perceptual signature (gravity defier, rune-reader) with elevated, mythopoetic diction that remains consistent under pressure. Free indirect access to Kael's interior is clean; no head-hopping. The elder Kael's single line of dialogue carries weight and subtext. Minor register issue: phrases like "procedural generation" and "probability cloud" introduce computational idiom that slightly tensions the otherwise archaic-lyric texture but remains voice-plausible for a character who thinks algorithmically. Psychic distance is stable; elision (what the tablet truly does, why Kael wants this) is purposeful and charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (vibrations, floor-conducted sound, visual signing). Distance control is consistent. Minor register drift: "filament of hush she hoped might enthrall the numbness" and the closing meta-statement "to remind her that numbness is only silence waiting to be spun backward into song" tip toward elevated diction that edges outside natural interiority under stress. Temen's sign-language and the phonograph's "broken wing" tone-arm add texture without obscuring focus.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable psychic distance; diction ("bruised into violet," "credibly curious nature," "reflex that made her note wind shear to the third decimal") roots voice in Elara's professional idiom. Perceptual signature is character-specific (meteorological precision filters sensory detail). Minor density slip: "the hush felt borrowed, as though someone had paused the world and forgotten to press play" reads slightly elevated for crisis narration, and "silvered proof" risks decorative abstraction. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches her knowledge throughout. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, philosophical, grounded in concrete perception ("liquid starlight," "memory of perfume in an empty room"). Psychic distance remains stable; the narrator's way of noticing is selective and poet-specific (rope fibers, clay impressions, the "texture of time"). Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("rough where it broke, smooth where it held") teach a rhythm that pays off at closure. Register remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak intrude. One minor convergence: the closing passage's syntactic parallelism ("still flesh, still poetry, still discovering") echoes earlier constructions, but this reads intentional rather than template-driven, reinforcing the meditative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara's acoustic filter. Perceptual signature is distinct: "drip of condensation...minor seventh begging resolution," "chronic hush," sensory hierarchy shaped by musician's ear. Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue. Distance control is clean; interiority remains character-bound. Minor register drift: phrases like "mendicant's bowl" and "vast, simple magnificence" push into slightly formal territory during emotional peaks, though the overall texture holds. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; Lira's perceptual signature is consistent (professional assessment, sensory acuity, the "pulse lied" motif). Diction modulates purposefully under pressure—precise and detached early ("counterfeit emotion," "subsume") softening to visceral image ("bruise," "aching affection"). The chemist's sparse dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. Minor: "voice crackling like static" and a few filter phrases ("sensing the tension") slightly dull immediacy, though they remain voice-motivated and the overall texture is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV narration with stable third-person distance and a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Marisol's maritime vocabulary ("demurrage," "cargo manifest," "relief supplies"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, with phrases like "whimsically attentive to each shelf he dusted, as though books were sleeping birds" and "starlight into confetti" providing texture. Minor slips: "cautious exuberance" and "the way strangers sometimes become necessary mirrors" drift toward generalized insight rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Miss, this came to the branch address…"), avoiding forced subtext but also not advancing pressure through speech. Free indirect style is clean throughout, with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with perceptual filters consistently grounded in Lira's sensory and emotional priorities (peat-and-sap smell, reed-weaving memories). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"chimed in the wind," "invisible yet unbreakable"—that modulates appropriately under pressure, compressing slightly when she kneels at the trunk. The twins' dialogue is minimal but functional; their sentence-finishing reads as character shorthand rather than fully embodied speech, a minor voice-convergence slip that doesn't materially harm distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV remains stable with a lyric, heightened register appropriate to the illustrator protagonist and fantastical setting. Perceptual signature is present (afterimages, negative space, "the scratch of a quill"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the womb of resonance," "choosing which memories to set free") that risks distancing the reader during peak beats. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrator's cadence stays consistent, but voice lacks the grit or idiosyncrasy that would make it indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and texture-rich, with a distinct perceptual signature (mathematical metaphors, secretive conjurer idiom, "gently inventive"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—compressed syntax during the ritual, expansive reflection in memory beats. However, elevated diction occasionally strains credibility for mid-crisis thought ("locus of possible intersections," "tectonic plates of turquoise memory") where simpler embodiment would sharpen immediacy. No dialogue; the solitary frame fits the concept. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias's perception throughout. Distance is controlled; interiority is filtered through his methodical observation ("sense memory flooded him," "felt himself becoming visible"). The single line of dialogue—"I see you"—is purposeful and advances the closure. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices conduits, oxide surfaces, and the rhythm of footsteps. One mild register issue: "sapphire hush" and "duende" feel slightly elevated for a crawl-space dweller's lexicon, though they could be read as the narrator's voice rather than Elias's thought. The girl's whispered recognition and the shift to her hand "resting on the boards" in the final line are cleanly focalized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchors tightly to Mira's perception (mossy texture, heartbeat slowing to sap pace). Perceptual signature is clear: she notices growth patterns, nutrient cycles, pH. The piece sustains voice through the metamorphosis ("laughter like wind through hollow bamboo"). However, the assistant's segment shifts to external observation without a clean break, and phrases like "brutal honesty of a plant forced to grow around a fence post, circuitously sincere" blend metaphor and descriptor in ways that feel more authorial than Mira's stressed cognition. No head-hopping within paragraphs, but the coda's new focalizer arrives without formal transition.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric-literary voice (ribboned rain trails, "drunken angle," "haggard awe"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the old woman's lines carry recognition and instruction without strong subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices art materials, water, ruins—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels writerly rather than character-bound ("unearthed convergence," "thresh meaning," "primordial seas now poisoned by human greed"). Free indirect style is clean, though some lines read as narrator commentary rather than Mara's interior voice. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering the cave through the pilgrim's evolving perception. Psychic distance shifts purposefully—intimate at the pearl transfer, panoramic in the final park scene—and diction stays consistent within a lyric register (e.g., "bright darkness," "steadily unpredictable"). Perceptual signature is selective: he notices the mollusk's heartbeat in the pearl, hears overlapping chords, and later perceives cave music beneath traffic. Purposeful compression and patterned phrases ("bright darkness," "steadily unpredictable") are taught early and recur with reweighted meaning at closure, legible under the Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy; free indirect thought remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (archival metaphors, blank-page harbor, sentences as masts) is consistent and voice-particular. Psychic distance remains controlled. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: the woman's "metallic and impossible to swallow" and the narrator's archive-entry offer carry subtext and advance the exchange. Register occasionally elevates ("reactively visionary," "folded into every doorway") in a way that fits the archival role but can feel studied rather than urgent. The prose voice modulates appropriately with scene pressure, though the final trumpet-blowing beat compresses quickly without deepening the narrator's interior texture under that peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV maintained; narrative distance is stable third-limited with psychic closeness. Perceptual signature is present—Alden notices cracks, sigils, arrows—filtered through his "analytically artistic mind." Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("starlit vault in mist," "fortress of unspoken truths") that tensions against the character's grounded profession but remains voice-motivated and legible under accumulative design. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (starlit vault, cracks forming arrows) are taught early and pay off at closure. One slip: "analytically artistic" reads slightly diagnostic rather than embodied, and some figurative phrases recur without full reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices seams, brass, margins, spirals—technical and scholarly anchors filtered through her skeptic's lens. The prose modulates from precise observation ("ivory inlaid with lapis numbers that crawled when viewed sideways") to lyric intensification under pressure ("parchment resembled night water broken by flukes"). Psychic distance tightens smoothly during the memory surge and reopens at the beach. One slip: "sympathetic skeptic" in the second line and "courageously kind" mid-story read as externally imposed labels rather than emergent from Mara's interior texture, and the phrase "patterns of continued becoming" in the final line drifts into abstract register inconsistent with her voice under resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Vey; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dimensionally aware," "Möbius sigh," "magnetic moans") but occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction under pressure ("colors singing in hushed thunder"). The technicians' brief dialogue ("What happens after goodbye?") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present (walls remember footsteps, futures reflected) but the register stays uniformly ornate rather than modulating with stress. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Cassidy notices formaldehyde and lilacs, eyelid weights, the "refrigerated" smile, the bruise-colored dawn. Dialogue carries subtext ("Trade requires disclosure") and advances plot. Diction occasionally elevates—"liquefy every rigid story," "negotiate vapor"—but remains within the voice of a clever seventeen-year-old raised by a con artist. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a distinct, lyric register—"gilded-leaf stationer," "silence that refracted," "incandescent restraint"—that establishes voice and sustains it under pressure. POV is stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering is consistent: Aurelia notices textures, hums, and the interplay of light in ways befitting her vocation. However, the elevated diction borders on purple in high-pressure beats ("sunrise outweighs night," "forgiven sin") and occasionally obscures immediacy; for example, "the velvet of 1912, the grit of 2077" reads more like catalog than lived perception. Psychic distance remains appropriate, and the narrative certainty matches Aurelia's knowledge. Free indirect style is clean, and no filter-verb stacks dull the momentum. The final image modulates tone effectively, but the density of metaphor in peak beats nudges into overwriting without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (she "collect[s] fragments of overheard stories the way dockworkers pocket dropped washers"). Diction fits the port setting and Mara's erasure: nameless, rhythm-defined identity. However, several passages drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("the texture of memories would emerge," "the piece invites reflection")—not head-hopping, but a tonal reach that slightly undermines voice modesty. The captain's dying monologue is compressed and functional, avoiding full dramatization of his speech patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable focalization through Arlen. Voice is distinct and lyrical ("bruised sky," "misfiled science," "ephemeral compass"), with controlled diction that matches a myth buster's perspective. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose modulates under pressure (from measured observation to "wolfish howl" to "sob"). No dialogue is present. The voice carries a perceptual signature (oceanic memory, star-dust, closing pages) that charges the ending. One minor slip: "the ephemeral compass that points not to magnetic north but to the instant where belief and debunking balance" reads slightly over-articulated for peak stress, though it remains within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited through Lina with a consistent perceptual signature (tactile detail, color-snagging, dual-pull interiority). Diction is mostly controlled, though some lines edge toward elevated register ("投射的火花" is an untranslated artifact; "hopeful desperation flickering across their faces like [projected sparks]" reads as a generation seam). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at peak beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "looked") appear but remain voice-motivated. Brief dialogue ("We can refuse to sign...") carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping; the piece holds focalization cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization: "She touched the camera's worn focus ring, feeling the tooth-marks of her grandmother's gloves" grounds perception in sensory specificity. The perceptual signature—scientific precision ("Species Anemone selenensis") layered with elegiac metaphor ("mourners agreeing to a eulogy")—is consistent and character-specific. Diction control holds under pressure: "crystalline clicks," "metallic heartbeat," "electrostatic whispers" marry technical observation to emotional charge. Minor wobble: "bioluminescent regret" risks anthropomorphizing the anemones beyond POV bounds, though it can read as her projection. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all sensory detail through Lira's non-visual perception (spectra against fingertips, warm thrum, boiler pitch as metronome). Diction stays consistent—technical yet embodied—and psychic distance tightens under urgency without head-hopping. Col's dialogue ("Copper bleeding into violet," "More green now") is functional and distinct from Lira's steady commands. However, several lines drift into elevated register during peak beats: "a Morse of fear it had learned when it crashed," "torque," "translucent map of refractive grooves" feel slightly authorial rather than Lira's lived idiom, and the final "tiny artificial star racing to meet the Aurora" reads more lyric than her established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren's perceptual signature is selective and profession-specific: she notices condensation spirals, dog-ears, mislabeled tributaries, the Registry's silence. Diction is controlled ("editor's instinct to annotate," "obsolete star charts," "ephemeral map"). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the descent, wider at the estuary overview). The final paragraph's rhythmic compression ("she listened for rivers learning to speak") charges closure. Minor slip: "worrying tranquility" in the penultimate paragraph is author-voice rather than Maren's idiom, and "subtly confident" appears as label rather than enacted trait.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Elian's perceptual signature—attention to vibration, absence, rhythm—remains consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the magical-realist register, with no head-hopping. However, the narrative distance is uniformly remote; we never move closer during peak moments (the fork shattering, his transparency beginning), which flattens emotional access. Sentence rhythm is controlled but formulaic in places: multiple clauses stacked with semicolons create a hypnotic but sometimes monotonous cadence. The prose reads as "written" rather than inhabiting the tuner's lived urgency, preventing full immersion at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited through Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (cartographer turned signal-sender, filtering through spatial awareness and guilt). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which fits the "lonesome splendor" tone but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("gathered hush," "slowmotion thunder," "lonesome splendor of the moment felt like arrival"). Under peak stress (prying open the console, uncorking the vial), the prose maintains its texture without compression, which is acceptable for this voice but borders on overwriting in a survival scenario. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can know; the temple's "instinct" and "preference" read as her projection rather than omniscient claim.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is ambitious and texture-driven: "copperlight repose," "hush coiling, fleeing," "manuscript unspooling." However, register drifts into elevated diction that strains credibility for a son chasing his father's echo ("parishioner," "perjured," "Conceptual Repricing"). Psychic distance is unstable: "the building sustains impossibilities" reads as narrator assertion rather than Cassian's perception. The father's single line of dialogue ("You chased the quiet all the way to silence") and Cassian's reply feel written rather than spoken. Perceptual signature is present but often submerged under metaphorical overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, psychic distance consistent. Diction is ornate and purposeful ("ashen-veil," "ephemeral cameo," "furnace wind") but occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is minimal (two exchanges); the boy's line "I didn't do it" is clear, but the bride's "Debt is a vine; it finds any sun" reads as thematic pronouncement. No head-hopping or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("poetic wharf weaver," "orchid solace," "muttering couplets that rhymed ruin with reverence") that feels voice-motivated and legible, though uniform across emotional peaks and valleys. Purposeful compression and fragment-like cadences ("sweet, funereal, promising renewal") are taught early and sustained. Deduction: the diction does not modulate under pressure; the climactic palm-pricking and final whispering maintain the same ornate lexicon as the opening, reducing the sense of urgency. Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-particular—descriptors like "moth-wing thin" and "luminous and impossible" could apply to any lyric narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the protagonist's perceptions and memories. Diction is elevated and lyric ("myrrh-scented air," "cautious enchantment thick as honey"), matching the piece's tone. The caretaker boy's single line of dialogue ("Are you here to rebuild or to rob?") feels purposeful and establishes stakes. However, several phrases read as constructed rather than lived-in: "warmly curious fingers," "warmly curious smile" (template repetition), "purposeful wandering" (adverbial abstraction). Psychic distance remains consistent, but the voice occasionally slips into exposition ("proving time had not forgotten") rather than trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (carefully inventive framing, attention to symbols and margins) fits the character. Diction is elevated and lyrical throughout, consistent with the nostalgic-futuristic tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("surrender of words to time," "map that might have led anyone to her center") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Register remains steady; no head-hopping. The voice is distinctive but leans toward a single texture without modulating sharply under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature (the embroiderer's craftsperson idiom, attention to thread and flame). The prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that clashes with the focalizer's embodied perspective: "synchronize her heartbeat to the echoed silence," "rewrote the night." Dialogue is minimal and functional; the embroiderer's "quavering voice that sounded senile" is told rather than shown through speech rhythm. Filter verbs ("she listened," "she heard") are frequent but voice-motivated. No head-hopping, but psychic distance flattens during the climax when her soft speech persuades without interior friction or embodied doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is lyric and imagistic with a consistent elevated register. POV remains stable (single first-person). However, diction frequently inflates into decorative density that distances reader from immediacy ("fierce tenderness wrapped in barnacle," "syllable of the apology now spoken"). Filter verbs are minimal. Perceptual signature is poetic but not character-specific—the narrator's way of noticing reads as authorial lyricism rather than a mind under pressure. The medium has no distinct voice; she speaks in the same register as narration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, first person, stable distance. Voice is lyric and densely figurative ("lotus-hearted," "barbed wire through the bone," "palimpsest where trauma and translation overlapped"), which fits the anesthetic haze and the narrator's translator register. Perceptual signature is consistent: coral, ink, dialect, and reef imagery recur with purpose. Dialogue is minimal (two lines from the child, one from the narrator) but purposeful and distinct in register. The high metaphor density in nearly every sentence risks overwriting but remains mostly legible and voice-motivated; a few constructions ("gyres of shared anxieties," "lotus-hearted ache") verge on elevated abstraction that may exceed the narrator's crisis lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering sensory detail through Luma's artistic perception: "the beams refused to co-operate; they scattered into bruised pewter." Perceptual signature is consistent—light as material, fog as canvas—and diction stays elevated yet legible. However, several lines drift into narrator-supplied wisdom rather than character-specific thought: "joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust" and "every future shadow she met would recognize the light she carried" read as thematic summary rather than Luma's idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature ("methodically playful," restorer's lens on pigment and tesserae) is consistent. Diction elevates ("tesserae," "rabbit-skin glue," "sounding stone") without violating the restorer's plausible lexicon. However, psychic distance wobbles: "The city exhaled, slabs shifting by millimeters" and "Liora felt her own edges soften; she was simultaneously kneeling, walking, and yet unborn" blend her perception with omniscient metaphor, blurring the POV frame. The guide's dialogue arrives without on-page setup, creating a brief spatial gap. Rhythm and syntax serve the lyric mode but occasionally drift into stock lyricism ("fireflies," "breathing book").

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Arlo's perceptions ("tasting nectar and nerves," "thoughts rippled outward"). Diction is elevated and often metaphorical ("surveillance drones," "moonlight taxed itself") in ways that match the speculative premise but occasionally slip into generic lyricism ("converging chaos pressurized inside a jar"). Voss's dialogue ("Late for horticulture, Finch") carries dry menace, and Arlo's reply shows tactical misdirection. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's retrospective scope ("By sunrise, seven gardens would bloom") shifts to a future-omniscient register that weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Zale; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic and layered ("hollowing blade," "reef-shadow joy"), creating a distinct texture. However, diction occasionally inflates into unanchored lyricism—"shyly unstoppable," "ensconced," "shellgram"—that feels more ornamental than character-specific. The postcard postscript ("When you tire of circling the war, plant the card where darkness can root") reads as thematic prompt rather than his mother's voice. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the voice flattens into a single register across emotional peaks rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-archival register with purposeful elevation ("diaphragms of sky and memory," "reading lectern carved from fossilized sighs") that matches the museum-of-extinct-feelings frame. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic poetic stock ("silk scarves pulled through needle eyes," "phosphorescent plankton") and syntactic patterns repeat: "she [verb], [result]" structures dominate the middle third. The perceptual signature is more conceptual than character-particular—Lira notices in abstractions (emotions, light, echoes) rather than through a specific sensory hierarchy. Compression and patterned elision (emotion drawers, memory transactions) are taught early and remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    The POV holds single third-person throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate ("prismatic," "micro-note," "spectral letters"), fitting an arcane linguist but occasionally drifting into decorative excess ("miniature galaxies of vowels that twinkled like stars") that slows momentum. Elara's speech to the archive ("I promise to return what was stolen") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present but generic for the archetype; the narrator's syntax remains uniform across emotional peaks, lacking the compression or jagged rhythm pressure would impose. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") appear frequently without voice necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third tracking Mireya. The prose establishes a distinct texture with elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "wax impression," "grinding whisper") that fits the quasi-mythic atmosphere. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory—"vine-choked steps," "slyly heartfelt reverence," "latest link in a chain older than resentment"—where the figurative density competes with clarity. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the delegations' voices are not individuated. Perceptual signature is consistent (engineer's eye on adhesive lattice, chain links, acoustic mechanics) but lacks embodied sensory variance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric and texture-rich, with strong perceptual signature: "dust motes rose and fell in slow arpeggios," "oil-drop eyes," "bronze throat releasing a flutter of wooden cuckoos." POV remains stable in close third, filtering setting and memory through Mirela's musician's idiom. However, the scaffold phrase "across learning to trust again" appears twice verbatim, a copy-paste artifact that breaks rhythm and clarity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dissolved network," "carte blanche") that sits uneasily against the immediate sensory texture, and Mr. Blackwood's dialogue ("chamomile tea and curiosity") is told rather than voiced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited focused on Juniper; perceptual signature is consistent (barefoot reading of grain, architect's daughter lens on thresholds). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured hush," "featherly determined steps," "intuit") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-particular, but remains legible and voice-motivated within the lyric mode. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens effectively when she closes her eyes and lets her feet read the floorboards, then steps into the between-place.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyric, and sustained across the piece with consistent imagistic diction ("shadowseam wonder," "moon-pipes vented silver bubbles," "luminous respite"). Perceptual signature is strong: the astrologer notices celestial reflections, chalk diagrams, and ritual gestures in character-specific ways. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose compresses purposefully ("softly ingenious echo") and the ghost's fragmented speech ("pulses") distinguishes it from the narrator's fluid observation. Under peak pressure the voice remains coherent without flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited focalization anchored in Lira's perceptual signature (sea-foam robes, recollectionist vocabulary, cheerful gloom as a felt oxymoron). Diction is lyric and controlled—"transliterated emotions," "conjecture," "crater glass"—with purposeful compression ("her gloom felt cheerful, the way dawn sometimes smiles while burying the stars"). However, elevated register ("transliterated," "conjecture," "mosaic spiral") remains consistent but somewhat uniform, and the voice does not degrade or shift under pressure. The final paragraph's rhythm ("Thus Lira the sea-foam recollectionist continued...") reads as distant summary rather than urgent close focus. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, psychic distance modulates purposefully, and diction is character-specific ("lightly attentive," "fragile null-space," "reversed fishing lures"). No dialogue appears. However, dense figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence—"gulls trace invisible thermals," "soapy stars," "living chessboard"—and while lyrical, the register occasionally drifts elevated beyond street-performer interiority ("tattooed in invisible ink across his conscience," "calculated wilderness of chords"). One brief filter-verb stack ("watched…staring…drawing") in the climax slightly dulls immediacy, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled register—"day's last sigh," "absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth." POV remains stable in close third with Lysira's perceptual signature (tide-dancer idiom, moonstone dust as contraband, gaps as memory's hiding place). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the dance intensification. Minor pattern: several lines rely on abstract phrasing ("flavor she knew," "motivation rose like an underground spring") that edges toward poetic assertion rather than concrete perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, diction lyric and consistent ("noctilucent reckonings," "drip of condensation...striking the black mirror"). Perceptual signature reflects Mara's glazier trade (facets, panes, lattice) and her private craft of reading patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("auroral residue still folded in the upper atmosphere," "brutal clarity"). Psychic distance is controlled, no head-hopping. The three spoken lines feel purposeful but slightly declamatory for peak-beat interiority. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric, metaphor-dense, and controlled through most beats ("silver scar," "fire writes in verbs too quick to read"). Psychic distance remains stable in tight third with Elias's perceptual signature (firefighter idiom, pain as language). However, register drifts into elevated diction under peak pressure ("celestial bodies performed their slow dance," "hard softness," "syllable by blistered syllable") that risks sounding authored rather than interior to a scarred ex-firefighter. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over immediacy, and some metaphors stack without adding pressure ("the ridge dissolved into the mind's darker forest where every tree was a question").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register with phrases like "serene upheaval" and "dandelion clocks in hurricane season." Vocabulary ("consensus reality," "jet stream of collective thought") sits at the edge of Mira's plausible lexicon but remains legible. Under peak stress (blood-pricking, equation-speaking), diction stays elevated rather than fragmenting, which may suit the "logical dreamer" frame but flattens embodied pressure. The "impossible, since no opening existed" aside is a rare direct-address moment that slightly breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with perceptual signature grounded in Mira's acoustic sensitivity and professional idiom ("corridor echo cartographer," "photosensitive gel"). Diction remains consistent under pressure, and the prose texture—"cadence of guilt," "flip-book spanning centuries"—reflects the building's archival memory without drifting into generic elevated register. Free indirect access is clean; no head-hopping or unmotivated filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature reads generic (dusky harmony, bruised violets, slow gold) rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("dusky harmony," "perceptively calm") that feels authorial rather than interior. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The voice is coherent but lacks idiosyncrasy; it could describe many narrators rather than this painter's particular way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelen with consistent perceptual signature (negotiator's lens cataloging names, recognizing ritual timing). Diction is elevated but consistent, matching the ritualized frame. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the ritual significance of place, of timing, of sacrifice") that reads more authorial than character-grounded. Free indirect style is generally clean, though some passages ("operatively gentle, a man whose voice could still a battlefield") lean expository. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled but the voice lacks sharp rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: guilt-laced attention to cracks, cost-benefit calculus ("calculating how soon"), and compressed poetic register under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the swallowing beat, pulling back for the final assessment. Diction occasionally risks elevated register ("inconvenient tug of tears," "cuckoo") that borders on over-literary, but the compression serves the accumulative lens and remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping; elision of prior scheming is purposeful, revealed through the climatologist bribe flashback that reweights the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and elevated ("bruised violet and arterial red," "veins of silver running through alabaster that mapped the human heart in anatomical verse"), consistent with the fantasy-courtly register. The perceptual signature is selective—Lys notices echoes, sanctuary facets, mercury tears—but sensory detail occasionally drifts toward catalogue ("perfume, gunpowder, or breast milk") rather than urgent filtering. Free indirect style is clean. Recurring poetic phrases ("between sigh and smile," "bodily poetic," "alarming serenity") risk template cadence but remain voice-motivated and pattern-taught, so no penalty under the Experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable and single-focalized throughout. Voice attempts lyricism with elevated diction ("urbane," "meteor hush," "parchment-like skin"), but the register often drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("ethical storytelling path," "half-lit epiphanies") that breaks from embodied perception. Perceptual signature is generic; Lucien notices in the same ornamental mode regardless of pressure. The prose reads as committee voice—averaged consensus rather than a singular, character-particular perspective—and lacks modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("blushing stillness," "transiently rooted"), creating a consistent atmospheric register. Perceptual signature is less character-specific than mode-specific; the prose reads as curated lyricism rather than Elara's idiosyncratic noticing. One line of dialogue ("I'm building this for the histories that dissolve") feels thematically on-the-nose. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable single first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: professional attention to wax, bronze, rope braids, and pattern. Diction is elevated and lyric ("frost-lensed skylight," "snowmelt ardor, technically gentle") but remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Under peak stress (rope lifting, voices unfolding) the compression is purposeful and the narrator's texture holds. Minor issue: "technically gentle" appears twice without clear internal justification for the modifier "technically," reading as a prompt artifact rather than earned idiom. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the ritual, distant during the walk back).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; the perceptual signature ("precisely playful," "equal parts crystal and rust") is distinctive and heightened. Diction is lyric and controlled: "cataract of living weather," "chlorophyll bleeds into circuits." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("transcend through interpreted dreams," "one another's becoming") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression is legible, though some lines ("precisely playful architecture tilt to keep her balanced") verge on overly ornate without grounding the effect in her immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Naram-bel's perceptual signature: he notices "pale constellations" of dust, "glazed bricks murmuring equations," starlight filtering through ancient clerestory. Diction is elevated and consistent—archaic, lyric, astronomer-inflected. However, several lines drift into expository omniscience: "the tile said to predate the first dynasty" and "mechanisms older than language" read as narrator intrusion rather than Naram-bel's plausible knowledge or inference. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but "empirically ironic" appears twice as narrator commentary rather than character thought, weakening the POV modesty standard. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lira throughout; no head-hopping. Distance control is mostly clean, though some elevated diction ("fascia and vein," "metabolize into the same carbon") reads as authorial rather than character-filtered during peak stress. The perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic—Lira notices transformation and memory but her syntax doesn't shift under pressure in character-specific ways. No dialogue appears; all pressure runs through action and interior reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV with stable third-limited focalization and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft (blowing glass from "sand and sighs," measuring altitude of dreams). Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent; the narrator's certainty matches the focalizer's knowledge. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor penalty for register density that occasionally slows comprehension ("cadence of frost forming on rusted gears") without dramatized pressure justifying the compression.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated diction ("quartz-eye mender," "tracery finer than any mason's dream," "photosynthesize into hope"). Psychic distance remains consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("time persisting like sap," "deciduous vows meant to brown and blow away") that reads more like external commentary than the mender's interior lexicon. The daughter's single line of dialogue ("if vows could grow back") feels purposeful, but the mender's reply ("Promises are leaves; they must fall so the tree notices its own rings") sounds crafted for thematic resonance rather than natural speech under pressure. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (quartz monocle, pollen-freckled) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose establishes a distinct, lyric-philosophical register with purposeful compression ("between toothpaste globules and phosphorescent moss, she experienced the first philosophical breakthrough"). However, diction drifts into academic abstraction ("nonlinear inheritance," "existential steam," "cognitive smoothness") that clashes with the embodied curator POV under peak pressure. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but the narrator oscillates between Mara's immediate perception and omniscient meta-commentary ("The simply complicated truth dawned"). No dialogue appears. The voice is consistent but risks museum-tour poeticism rather than character-particular thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.7)
    Voice is consistently ornate and lyric, but perceptual signature remains generic across high and low pressure moments. Elara's diction never modulates with urgency; phrases like "carefully resourceful" and "a symphonic note" read as external labels rather than embodied perception. The time traveler's dialogue ("I can cut the sentence") and Elara's reply are exposition disguised as conversation, lacking subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance is stable but lacks character-particular texture; the prose reads as committee voice rather than a singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register throughout, with baroque diction ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant," "phosphor vines") that reads voice-motivated rather than POV-leaking. However, the perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific: the narrator notices in ornamental, uniform ways regardless of emotional pressure. Psychic distance remains stable but remote; we never feel the sister's pulse or the protagonist's contradiction in embodied terms. Free indirect style is absent; the narration operates in a decorative third that tells us "she understood" rather than showing the understanding arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct: an archivist reading contours, composing catalog entries, thinking in cross-references ("F for fable, A for absence, V for Voss"). Diction is elevated but controlled, matching the archival idiom ("warmly methodical," "orderly cannibalism of seconds"). No dialogue to evaluate. Two slips touch high-band entry: (1) "the world forgot something it could not bear to remember" anthropomorphizes "the world" in a way that blurs focalization, and (2) narrative certainty about the graduates' future feelings ("every graduate would leave feeling oddly full") exceeds Elara's plausible knowledge in the moment, reading as authorial rather than character-bound inference.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout, filtered through the mapkeeper's professional lens (reading crack patterns, conjuring stillness "the way an old potter coaxes clay"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices ice fissures, mineral formations, and vibrational cues that others miss. Jalen's single line of dialogue is absorbed by the stone, a purposeful elision that dramatizes the threat. Psychic distance tightens under pressure in the dome. Some figurative density ("gently luminous" recurs five times, "hammered repose" twice) risks ornament, but the diction remains within the keeper's contemplative register and does not obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled compression ("hope in the shape of ribs," "hour's ink"). POV remains stable third-limited; the custodian's perceptual signature (retrocognitive flashes, star-path navigation) is consistent. Diction stays elevated throughout, matching the mythic-textural mode. Two slips: "retrocognition now forward-cast" in the final paragraph introduces a concept (forward retrocognition) without prior grounding, reading as convenient expansion. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she heard") cluster in the retrocognitive beats but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance is intentionally compressed, fitting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited; psychic distance remains close and controlled. Diction is elevated and densely metaphoric throughout ("palimpsest," "ossify," "unfinished sea"), matching the archivist's scholarly interior voice. However, the uniformly lyric register—nearly every sentence carries figurative weight—risks flattening urgency peaks into a single textural band. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear sparingly and are voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices archival and mnemonic detail (shadow lengths, whispered footsteps, pellets as lost names). No head-hopping or POV leakage. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and held; the piece reads as intentional accumulative prose.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent elevated-lyric register ("chanted while walking, a low rhythm that matched the pulse of the ramparts"). Psychic distance remains stable, and Luma's perceptual bias (noticing fire, rhythm, light) is character-specific. The dialogue exchange with the governor is sparse but functional, though both speakers' diction converges into the same philosophical register ("reckless weight that cracked the shell of order" vs. "seriousness without playfulness calcified"). The narrator's lexicon is controlled, but phrases like "filtering memories of every sky she had ever lit through ambient awareness" and "serious playfulness in their step" occasionally drift into abstraction that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV held throughout; focalization is stable and the chronicler's perceptual signature—warmly observant, tangential—is consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with patterned phrasing ("texture of time," "memory-forward," "transition period made visible") that teaches its idiom early. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (the daughter's shadow merging, the contact passing warmth). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic summary ("a quiet archive," "lesson inherited"), and the daughter's interior remains externally observed without distinct voice when she speaks her single line, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: "the flavors of different silences" filters all observation through Lira's synesthetic frame. Diction is lyric and controlled, with compression that reads purposeful ("intangibly tangible," "audible colors that only the claustrophobic could see"). Register remains within the focalizer's metaphor-dense idiom throughout. No dialogue appears. Minor slips: "She believed that if she could name each quiet, she might stretch the contracted walls of her lungs" tells motivation rather than showing the belief in action, and the phrase "xenial trellis" is repeated without variation, risking echo.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Nilo; perceptual signature is distinct (he notices brass, crystal geometry, decibel needles, the "vaulting hush he cultivated"). Diction—"fluidly logical script," "frozen sigh," "seamstress slipping needles"—is elevated and consistent, matching the lyric-philosophical register. The commuter's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the throttle, wider at the cloud-sea reflection). Minor friction: "ghost-echoes that swirled around the commuter's guarded heart" briefly asserts interiority from outside the POV, a small leak that does not break the frame but nudges certainty beyond what Nilo can plausibly infer from breath and grip.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "feeling the pulse of history," "the strange marriage of magic and technology," "the beautiful absurdity of it all." Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("transcended, leaving the throne empty as an invitation rather than an absence") inconsistent with embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue. Diction is competent but lacks character-specific idiom; the lore keeper's voice could belong to any fantasy-quest narrator. Filter verbs ("feeling," "understanding") appear frequently without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the breath-sharing, wider for exposition). Diction is consistent and voice-specific: "loaded emptiness," "frozen tears," "stones into a deep well." Dialogue feels natural and advances the thematic question. Brief filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose rhythm shifts with pressure—short sentences during the ritual, longer reflection afterward—without head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices submarine bolts, 42-hertz hums, and invoice metaphors. Diction is inventive ("quantum promise like neon scripture," "barometric scars") but occasionally drifts into elevated register during high-pressure beats ("carbonizing into a single point of unbearable clarity"). No dialogue appears; all speech is glitch-text, which reads as purposeful compression. However, filter verbs cluster in the cave sequence ("felt every unpaid installment," "pictured submarine portholes") where immediacy would benefit from direct perception. The final shift to past-tense summary ("she would not volunteer again") modulates distance intentionally but slightly deflates momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Arin; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and metaphor-dense ("ancestral breath returning to testify"), establishing a lyric register, but perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Arin's way of noticing reads interchangeable with the narrator's. The dialogue-free design fits the tone. Under peak pressure (handle snapping, blood flowing), syntax remains ornate without collapsing into compression or urgency, missing an opportunity to modulate rhythm. Filter verbs ("sensed," "detected") are present but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close focalization on the knight. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during transformation, slightly wider for setting description). However, the prose frequently slips into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon: "gravitational tenderness," "factually mystical artifact," "continuous folding." The single line of dialogue ("Your murmured allegiance binds you...") reads archaic-formal but appropriate to the mystical frame. Perceptual signature is present but generic (warrior noticing theatrical elements, feeling shame) rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is consistent and distinctive in its cadence but risks preciosity in peak beats where simpler diction would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Rowan; perceptual signature is consistent (archivist's tactile reading, dust as script, labels as scabs). Diction is controlled and lyric ("dark breathe," "gooseneck lamp," "peppermint"). The prose compresses time cleanly ("Tonight, alone...") and interiority stays specific ("she was waiting for one small kindness to magnify"). Minor slip: "tactfully hopeful" and "breathing" as database provenance edge toward precious register in two beats, and the "examined unknown now charged with marching orders" phrase momentarily abstracts. Distance modulates appropriately under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira throughout. Diction is lyric and heightened ("auric," "azimuth," "cadence"), creating a distinct texture but occasionally drifting into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-specific for a seventeen-year-old street artist. Perceptual signature is present (puddle reflections as waveforms, Orion glints as Morse code) but reads more authorial than Mira's lived idiom. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—music and mist filter all observation. Syntax modulates effectively under pressure: shorter fragments during peak tension ("Not yet, not yet"), longer lyric cadences during reflection. The one line of dialogue ("Not yet, not yet") is whispered "through the horn's neck" and serves both goal pursuit and atmospheric effect. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vested hush," "spectral voices," "consensus reality") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. The narrative voice remains singular and voice-motivated, but the perceptual texture could sharpen further to reflect the saxophonist's professional idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mireya; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric ("pale moths," "soft thunder," "mossy delight"), though register occasionally drifts elevated ("regional folklore adjusted itself overnight"). The phrase "emerges transformed always" recurs as a refrain but reads as external narration rather than Mireya's perception, risking psychic distance slip. Perceptual signature is present (seed-sorter's attention to size, color, hum) but not deeply biased. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not testable here.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly through Elias's perceptual signature—"uncertainly certain," the tick he carries in his bones, seeing glow through stinging dark—and diction remains consistent with a tinkerer's idiom ("oil-can," "brass dome," "navvies"). The "years later" shift to omniscient sailors' legend creates a deliberate distance modulation that charges the closure by showing consequence, but the switch lacks a clear section break, causing mild POV leakage. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though runs like "He left... He locked... He walked" and "They said... And that if..." show template cadence in the final third. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited holds stable; POV anchors in Aurelia's alchemical perception with consistent diction ("heart-balance," "alembic," "calcined"). Register remains elevated throughout, even in high-pressure beats, without modulation for urgency or degradation. Perceptual signature is character-specific (kintsugi metaphor, zodiac symbols), but syntactic uniformity—long, clause-heavy sentences with frequent semicolons—flattens rhythm across emotional peaks and valleys. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited; psychic distance remains consistent. Voice carries a lyric, heightened register ("modestly fearless heart ticking like a quiet metronome," "luminous ache") that is internally coherent but borders on ornamental at peak beats. The narrator's perceptual signature is present (light as blade, gorge as throat, giggle as minnow) but the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("spectral confessions," "silver mirage") that dilutes immediacy. Elara "spoke—not with voice but with the modestly fearless silence she carried like a second skeleton"—a syntactic flourish that asserts rather than dramatizes. No head-hopping; voice is singular.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single first-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature: technical diction ("millijoules," "asymptotic," "coefficient") interwoven with lyric compression ("ultraviolet light dripped from every leaf") creates a voice that is both analytic and sensory. Psychic distance is stable. The prose modulates under pressure—short bursts during memory spasms, longer contemplative lines during equation discovery. However, register occasionally drifts into explanatory mode: "ultraviolet penance required no priest, only photons calibrated to the exact shade of shame" reads like exposition rather than lived thought. Filter verbs ("letting," "watching") are voice-consistent but numerous. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: lyric, compression-heavy diction ("elusively tangible," "catwalks…humming with the weight of memory"). The prose modulates purposefully (intimate urgency when facing boy-self, expansive reflection at closure). Non-standard syntax and fragment-like constructions are pattern-taught and legible. Minor issue: at peak pressure ("I speak the lullaby backward"), elevated register ("honoring overlooked histories means returning what was taken before loss calcified") briefly drifts from embodied immediacy into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's professional lens shapes what she notices (cable tension, dust patterns, screws groaning like trapeze rigging). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "eyes like blown fuses," "frost patterns are faint," "ghosting through the shaft of her own life." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the loop discovery and opening slightly in the reflective close. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor slip: occasional elevated register ("engaging the moment the way she engaged a mis-leveled car") edges toward authorial distance under peak stress, though it remains within Mara's technical idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable single third-person limited to Corwin; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "frost wrote its patterns," "chase" as heart-metaphor, "negotiable sky." Diction is elevated and consistent ("cloud-vellum," "composing stick," "armillary") but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction ("signature in a book," "drop of ink about to fall") that dilutes immediacy. Psychic distance stays close during the press scene, widens during the library's transformation without dissonance. Free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates with event intensity (short clauses when the platen descends, longer cascades during the library collapse) though peak-stress compression is minimal. Passes most bullets but lacks a distinct rhythm under pressure that would elevate into 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Aurelia; no head-hopping. Voice is distinctive—elevated, lyric diction ("burnished sorrow," "multiplying gaze," "country that existed only because she had reimagined it")—but the register sometimes inflates beyond the moment's pressure ("poetically inclined" becomes an authorial claim more than dramatized trait). The archaeologist's brief shift at the end is legible. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("Drop the artifact," "Mirrorless, we become the reflection we sought"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though a few lines blur psychic distance ("no longer certain which side of history he occupied").

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elias, with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a fabulist register ("the covenant of rust had claimed it," "the chamber wilts near dishonesty") that fits the tinkersong wonder tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "mending what isn't torn," "offered his unvarnished self as lubricant," "spirit resonant" read more like authorial poetry than a repairman's interiority under stress. The perceptual signature (decades of coaxing song from broken gears) is present but underused; more specific professional bias in what Elias notices would sharpen the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates purposefully (close during psychometry, wider during the spiral descent). Perceptual signature is consistent: Ivy notices scent, counts vials, feels metal fever-warm. Diction is elevated and lyric ("quilt of petrichor," "mineral sparks," "silence thick as felt") but coherent within the established register. Two friction points: "politeness excused it" (terror) reads as authorial intrusion rather than Ivy's voice, and "hinged awakenings" as phrase appears both as prompt element and narratorial summary without clear POV anchoring. Compression is purposeful (the vision "slammed shut almost as quickly as they opened") and supports urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Syntax varies effectively, though some figurative density in the final third ("brass-coloured light, seeping into her ribcage") approaches overwriting without crossing into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature (sculptor noticing grain, pitch, barnacle accretion). Vocabulary fits an artist in storm reverie—"geas," "stylus," "armature"—but occasionally drifts elevated ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie") in ways that feel authorial rather than Maela's idiom under pressure. No dialogue on the page. Sentence rhythm modulates well (short bursts during storm, longer cadences during carving). Minor filter-verb use ("felt her own pulse recruited") doesn't dull immediacy. Compression at closure ("just horizon, just wood, just the next breath") serves the ending without obscuring focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited tracking Liora. Diction is elevated and poetic ("umbral tenderness," "spectral petals," "sifted ash") but consistent and voice-motivated for an artist narrator. Psychic distance remains close without head-hopping. Some phrases approach purple ("rotting leaves remained," "quietly driven") and the closing paragraphs shift toward an omniscient summarizing voice ("Years later, travelers still find…"), which dilutes the earlier intimacy. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct and dense: "liquid night under day," "throat full of salt," "kerosene onto a ready flame." Psychic distance is stable first-person, anchored in Mireya's perceptual signature (archival vocabulary, grief-soaked imagery). Diction remains elevated but character-consistent (civil-rights archivist, poetic register). No head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the broadcast itself is compressed to preserve momentum and let the image land. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the final long sentence accelerates through the crowd's response without muddling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: alchemical lexicon ("retort," "phosphor ink," "solvent"), craft-oriented noticing (wire ribs, reed frames, copper anchors), and philosophical compression ("working memory transmuted") establish a singular voice. POV remains stable first-person; psychic distance modulates purposefully between tactile present (striking a match, cutting pages) and reflective synthesis. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure—short declaratives at the bottle confrontation ("No," I said) contrast with lyric expansions in ritual passages. One minor slip: "solitude teaches monologue" edges toward meta-commentary, slightly breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong (tweezers "consecrated for oaths," quince-juice ink distilled each autumn) and diction fits Ambrose's archival register ("venerable," "xylem," "subsonic grief"). However, elevated vocabulary peaks in high-pressure beats without always advancing pressure ("translucent ribbon showed microscopic grooves," "velvet disquiet that drapes itself") and some passive constructions dull immediacy ("prophecy's cruelty: the foghorn had not died; it had migrated"). Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The prose remains character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and textured, with a consistent elevated register ("wild serenity," "silk soaked in dawn," "chronicle") and controlled psychic distance. However, the diction occasionally drifts toward abstract poeticism that blurs immediacy ("furiously tranquil," "murmur: We are the unspent future") and repeats syntactic stems ("felt," "She walked," "breath"). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. The compression and patterned repetition serve the accumulative lens, but under peak pressure (vortex moment, choice to split) the voice stays ornamental rather than tightening, missing the rhythmic escalation expected at 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and filters all perception through Mara's professional ear and mountain-attuned attention. Diction is distinct—"microclimate hiccup," "lee-wave rotor," "inverse chimney the sky's throat"—blending technical precision with lyric compression. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: short bursts at 03:59 ("She pressed the switch"), longer cadences during reflection ("she understood the mountain wanted the bell, not the siren"). Elision is purposeful: "after the glue dries" recurs with reweighted meaning. Minor slip: "credibly curious" in paragraph two reads as external label rather than voice-motivated phrase, and "humble storm siren tester" in the final line edges toward authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-omniscient register with elevated, image-dense syntax ("dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies," "primal elegance of shared orbit") that matches the cosmic-intimate tone. POV distance remains stable in third-person-limited focused on the janitor, and the perceptual signature—spiritual curiosity filtering meteors as confidants—is character-specific. However, the prose occasionally slides into sermonic phrasing ("understanding that strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere") and the final two paragraphs shift toward a distanced retrospective voice ("They assumed," "Sometimes, on nights") that blurs the earlier tight focalization without a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Alden; psychic distance modulates appropriately. Perceptual signature is present (contextual clues, attention to visual refraction, soot as sensory anchor) but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully voice-motivated: "tranquilly perceptive" and "mute eloquence" feel authorial rather than Alden's idiom under duress. Dialogue appears only in the final whisper, which breaks his silence purposefully. Filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "noticed") cluster in several lines without clear voice gain, reducing immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric compression ("borrowed-time timekeeper, whose ledger once ticked in neat columns"), purposeful syntactic density, and a consistent perceptual filter (everything becomes textural metaphor). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's immediacy ("each narrative heartbeat a coin minted in the emerald silo's shadow"). Dialogue, when present, feels natural and advances plot (the boy's explanation, the trade negotiation). The prose serves the Accumulative lens but risks over-ornamentation in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person close on the poet; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and reflective remove. Diction is consistent and literary without register mismatch: "burnished hush," "vane was torn," "lunar" smile. The woman's single laugh and lack of greeting distinguish her minimally; no dialogue tests subtext or goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present in the poet's "warmly attentive" filter, and the prose rhythms support the meditative tone. Minor slip: "its seam pulled loose by the storm" risks mixed metaphor (horizon as fabric), but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices micro-currents, copper patina, and cadence ("twenty-four beats per minute"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("corridors bent like intestines toward mutual understanding") that strains the caretaker's lexicon under terminal illness. Dialogue is minimal (brief exchanges with tourists, direct address to the orchard) and functional. Minor penalty for head-hopping: "the fox yawned…Mara took the gesture as consent" assumes vulpine intent without earning it through prior dramatization of the fox's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; perceptual signature (scientific lens: "chemistry of homecoming," "cyanotype rinse," "isotope") is distinct and consistent. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Diction stays anchored in Mara's academic-rebellious register ("luminous skeptic," "failed catalyst"). Some filter verbs appear ("She saw," "She believed," "She had come to understand") but don't dull immediacy in peak beats. One rhythm slip: "She paused... She climbed... She stepped... She activated..." creates template cadence in the tower sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: lyric, archaic-inflected diction ("gloom-hill coachman," "flower-drunk sand," "narrow vastness") remains consistent and purposeful throughout. POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to the coachman's perception; no head-hopping occurs. The compression is patterned and legible: elliptical phrasing ("only seeds, only stories") and figurative density ("the dead languages carried him") charge the final beats. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into generic poeticism ("petals drifted upward, turning into tiny lanterns") that lacks the coachman's perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the final line ("begin") lands with rhythmic intent, but some beats rely on stock symbolic gestures rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited through Scraps, with strong perceptual signature (scent-driven syntax, "copper glow," "ghost of a voice"). Diction is lyric and consistent—"wild hush," "tinted revelations"—but edges into elevated register ("intuitive descriptive tug," "courier teaching distance how to kneel") that risks outpacing the bloodhound's plausible interiority. Kite's dialogue is minimal; when present it is goal-driven and carries subtext without false therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third with stable close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: "relativistic years," "temporally stretched," "confusion is just exploration wearing a mask" fit Kael's navigator role and grief-state. Diction occasionally edges into elevated lyricism ("blessed pariah," "hollowed heart") but remains voice-motivated. No head-hopping. The compass/Mother voice transition is legible as subjective breach. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (short fragments during the hatch moment, longer swoops in the corridor). Clean control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is stable, lyric, and compressed throughout, with purposeful heightened diction ("sacredly playful," "cautious abandon") that the text teaches early and sustains. POV remains single (Vespers) with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature—poetic, elliptical, attuned to wonder—remains character-consistent. Dialogue (the child's two lines, Vespers's reply) carries subtext and advances the handoff without breaking voice. Elision is pattern-taught (the chess match skips many moves, the spire's collapse is compressed), and the closure image reweights the sundial lid without requiring causal blow-by-blow. No filter-verb stacks or mid-pressure register drift; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance, and the elevated register ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") reads as intentional voice rather than drift. However, the diction frequently prioritizes lyric beauty over character-specific perception—phrases like "vowels of air that tasted like iron and lilac" feel authorial rather than filtered through a former crisis actor's sensibility. Kestrel's single line of dialogue carries subtext but arrives too late to establish voice distinction. The prose texture is controlled and purposeful, yet the perceptual signature lacks the idiosyncratic particularity that would ground this voice in Mara's lived experience rather than elegant observation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (mercury-glass skin catching sun, feather texture guiding turns, sensory filtering through prophecy-trauma). Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, appropriate for the fantastical premise. However, high-density figurative language pervades most sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("mercury-glass," "eels in a sack," "taffy," "tuning forks," "storm-cloud suede," "ink-black wind"), creating occasional register drift that slows momentum in peak beats. The custodian's speech ("Seeking?" "Reality is rearranged by subtraction") reads distinct from narrative voice but his single exchange is brief. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter (chess metaphors, geometry, "fierce repose of tournament halls") is distinct to Marek. Diction is controlled: "winnowing that separated useful remorse from paralyzing shame" and "the lines of his face rearranged into the fierce repose" are precise. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "consequence could also be held in place, examined, rewound" and "the folds of regret he kept circling" read more like authorial summary than embodied thought under pressure. No dialogue is present (correctly, given the solitary frame). Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "footstep back… as a whispered accusation," "mist began to swirl into shapes," "forged hush." Diction elevates appropriately for an artist-in-exile but remains character-bound. No dialogue on the page; Lira's improvised recitations ("Forgiveness is a coin with two faces…") feel performative and voice-appropriate. Minor register drift: "the method her mentor once mocked—impromptu poetry sessions—was the only tool left" reads slightly expository for peak pressure. Compression and elision are purposeful; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person close on Lira with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—technical alchemist diction mixed with grief-laden imagery—is present but uneven: phrases like "quilts memories together into a sigil" and "kintsugi intentions" read as concept-first rather than Lira's organic thought under pressure. The rebreather mask and thirteen-second breath cycle anchor physicality well, and the narration of pockmarks as "a star map of ruin" fits her analytic lens. However, at peak stress (final chains snapping), the voice escalates into elevated register ("witness," "quilt her into the greater story") rather than compressing or fracturing under duress, which softens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "gulls screamed like circular saws," "shells that chimed under his boots like tiny porcelain bells," plankton as "bioluminescent…freckles." Diction remains within an artist's lexicon with purposeful elevation ("intimately aloof," "cathedral veins," "transference"). Narrative certainty matches what Ren can plausibly infer; the shell's impossible preservation is registered as mystery, not explained. Minor penalty: the phrase "intimately aloof" recurs identically without modulation, and one moment—"the impossible familiarity made his heart race until he heard the promise answering back"—edges toward declarative certainty about an internal concept not fully dramatized in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the diction (cobalt, jasmine, mercury glass) is controlled and purposeful. However, the voice drifts into elevated, nearly allegorical register ("vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions the way fire purifies water") that feels authorial rather than filtered through the protagonist's lived grief. Phrases like "screaming tenderness" and "unbearable love" cluster in peak beats, creating a rhythm of poetic assertion that distances the reader from immediate embodied experience. The perceptual signature is more lyric than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent lyric register. The narrative voice is distinct, syntactically purposeful, and rhythmically controlled, with metaphoric density that reads as intentional rather than ornamental. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and sustained. However, perceptual signature is more tonal than character-specific—the narrator's way of noticing (moon as clipped coin, grief as weight) reads as authorial lyricism rather than the protagonist's particular idiom under stress. Psychic distance remains cool throughout; we never move close enough to experience sensory degradation or raw perception during the dissolution. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (the forager filters everything through tactile and olfactory experience). Voice modulates effectively under pressure—syntax tightens during the mixture preparation and expands in the final reflection. The single line of dialogue ("Don't") reads purposefully sparse and sourceless, charging the moment. Minor issue: occasional register drift toward abstract diction ("cultivating psychological safety," "fractured grace" as narrator's phrase rather than character's) slightly strains the established voice, though the surrounding concrete imagery mostly anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct: Maris notices absences "as diligently as any signal," her lighthouse-trained attention filtering the world through gaps and rotation. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("borrowed memories," "witnessed isolation"). The prose occasionally reaches for elevated metaphor ("fog hums in a bell," "time itself had stepped ashore") that flirts with overwriting but remains legible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is cleanly managed.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices margins, symbols, and promises. Diction is controlled, though "empirically intuitive" and "blooming cavern at midsummer" read slightly elevated for the grounded voice elsewhere. The closing passage's rhythm modulates well ("with a deep breath") but the final clause ("carrying away the old life and welcoming the new") tips into thesis-voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction is lush and elevated ("lacy menace," "coppery air, tasting iron, tasting endings"), consistent throughout but occasionally slips into decorative phrasing that stalls momentum ("a lacy menace that wrapped her lungs with threads of ice"). Psychic distance remains close; narrative certainty matches the focalizer's knowledge. Perceptual signature is poetic but not sharply character-particular—similar phrasing could fit many fantasy protagonists. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable. Voice has distinct texture: "cracking like cooling magma," "urgent of someone who'd practiced truth until it became foreign," "long ribbons that tied past to future." Mira's dialogue carries subtext ("directed spontaneity of someone who'd rehearsed casualness"). Weakness: elevated register in reflection passages ("the density of presence," "mathematics beyond chemistry," "palette of resolve") drifts from the tactile voice used in action beats, and the phrase "scientifically romantic" reads as a label rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters the mountain through archivist idiom ("distill chaos into narrative," "columns for the forest service archive") and lyric compression ("autumn tongues," "snow into blue glass"). Psychic distance modulates cleanly from close interiority ("grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live") to embodied action (knelt, laid, placed). No dialogue present. Diction remains within her educated, introspective lexicon. Minor slip: "jaded wonder rattling in her ribs" tilts toward abstract label in a high-pressure beat, but the perceptual texture holds under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (metallic textures replacing scent). Diction is controlled and rhythmic, though several passages verge on elevated lyricism that strains against workshop-intimacy ("diaphragm contracting in slow motion," "spindle around which spun every unseen wonder"). The phrase "trembling calm" recurs as motif rather than organic perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Lina's perceptual signature: rune-scholar specificity (crow-quill, squid-ink with powdered jade), embodied metaphor (heartbeat as rune gone wrong), and grief-filtered attention (the brother's laugh as wind through pine). Diction remains character-apt throughout pressure (no register drift). Distance modulates purposefully: close during the stroke sequence, wider for the storm's arrival and Master Jomei's tea-pouring. One brief convergence: "tools that had done their job and could now rest" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward narrator commentary rather than Lina's idiom, though it does not break the stance. No dialogue clutter; Master Jomei's single line ("The storm listens now; tell it who you are") carries ceremonial weight and advances plot.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the exorcist's musical idiom ("breath caught, forming a brittle chord," "bow the air until music believes you"). Diction is distinct and purposeful, with compressed syntax matching urgency. The ghost's pizzicato whispers provide brief voice differentiation. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats—"fractured into thirty-two facets, each one a metaphor," "brutal 4/4 time"—creating slight distance where immediacy would sharpen impact. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a distinct perceptual signature—"resounding hush that tasted of starlight and dust"—throughout. POV remains stable (close third), and the narrator's way of noticing (abstractions rendered as sensory events) is coherent. However, no dialogue appears, and under peak pressure the diction stays ornamental rather than compressing to match urgency. Psychic distance never modulates; the witness observes herself with the same detached lyricism at every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("eminently peculiar," "fjord quiet," "watercolor wash of impossible gradients") that suits the philosophical subject. However, the diction often drifts into generic profundity ("the space between memory and possibility, the breath held between what was and what might yet be") that could belong to any metaphysical meditation rather than Torvald's particular perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. The prose maintains third-limited POV without head-hopping, and the compression/elision is purposeful, though the final paragraphs' abstraction weakens the embodied grounding established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("rainwashed," "clover melancholy," "lattice of love beneath the ruin"). However, diction sometimes drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Mira-particular under pressure: "traverse the city I mapped in riddles," "widen perspectives responsibly," "lucid contradictions." The father's diary voice and Mira's narration converge in tone, reducing distinction. Purposeful compression is present but the perceptual signature doesn't shift noticeably under stress, keeping this in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric with controlled compression ("cultivated estrangement the way gardeners cultivate orchids," "soundtrack of nothing became oxygen"). POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (sound-focused, pattern-oriented, isolation-valuing) remains consistent. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Teach me how endings begin" / "Find the loop you're terrified of and step one frame beyond it"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "between the hum of streetlamps" recurs as a phrase-anchor but risks becoming a tic; the device is purposeful but borders on overuse by the final reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance remains controlled. Voice carries a distinct texture—"haunted euphoria," "steep promise," "graft of futures and pasts"—that reflects the archivist's archival mindset. The single line of dialogue ("Evening, miss; just packing memories?" / "No, planting them") is purposeful and advances the thematic stakes. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices barnacles, nails, splinters, the locket's warmth. Some diction ("blooming jetty," "regenerated covenant") occasionally tilts ornamental, but remains voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, Kit's perceptual signature is consistent: "desperately jocular armor," "echo in the iron rafters sounded like passengers clapping." Diction fits his logistician background and off-grid state. Dialogue (Kit and Lila) carries subtext and distinct rhythm ("Would you like to hear the one about the train" vs. "I'm here to collect the moon tax"). Distance is stable. Minor register drift: "polite to the last" and "perfect polite yet anarchic" veer toward narrator rather than Kit's interior lexicon under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (citrus taste of frequencies, Braille of sound, warm ink through pores). Diction is consistently elevated and poetic. Two frictions lower the score: filter-verb stacks ("he could taste," "he knew," "he felt," "he carried") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy; and several metaphors stretch coherence ("bloated with consonants," "wet heart of silence"). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The voice modulates with intensity (spiral tightening, kneeling, dawn release) but the elevated register remains uniform rather than shifting under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focus on Mira's perception. Diction is elevated and lyric ("filaments," "contingency," "light-cones") but consistent with a signal interpreter's idiom; no mid-scene head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the pen-scratch edit, pulling back slightly for the mentor's memory and the anomaly's hum. Minor penalty: abstract register ("contingent relationships," "effect arrived pre-threshed") occasionally drifts into conceptual exposition that tells theme rather than filtering it through embodied perception. The gravitational anomaly "tugging at her bones like a polite but insistent child" is vivid and character-specific, anchoring the lyric mode. Elision is purposeful (no ink in the pen, "metaphor up here"), taught early, and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person omniscient POV maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric register throughout: "that slippery hour between last call and first gull, when even the barges forget their own names." The prose carries a consistent perceptual signature (poetic compression, metaphor-dense, archaic diction like "capstan" and "cleat") that never breaks into head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance remains far enough to avoid filter-verb stacks and close enough to render the advisor's gestures with sensory immediacy. The narrator's certainty about collective interiority ("people now paused mid-sentence, palms half-raised") stretches plausibility but reads as intentional omniscient sweep. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The voice is distinctive and purposeful, though the lyricism occasionally obscures micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.9)
    Narrative distance is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("corporeal," "analytically intuitive," "the greater revelation") inconsistent with a character in crisis. Ember's perceptual signature is generic—she traces, finds, understands—without idiosyncratic filtering. Phrase recycling is pervasive: "volcanic tenderness" appears five times, "artistic creations" four times, "hidden message" / "forgotten promise" / "analytically intuitive" recur without variation. Free indirect style blurs with summary exposition, especially in the final third where nearly every paragraph begins with declarative insight.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with psychic proximity that allows figurative interiority. Voice is lyric and science-fictional, maintaining register throughout (no colloquial intrusions). The perceptual signature favors synesthetic metaphor ("sound wave garden," "contrail smoke spelling names") that feels consistent with Mira's altered senses. However, peak-pressure beats layer dense metaphor without grounding in simpler sensory anchors, risking opacity: "ghost notes of lullabies hummed by mothers she had never met" is evocative but does not clarify what Mira physically hears or feels. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful (clinic procedures summarized to focus on garden sequence).

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature is professional and sensory (tracking footsteps by rhythm, vibrations through container walls). Voice is consistent, though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("calculated spontaneity of the moment," "layers of emotion that seemed to echo"). Dialogue carries subtext in the whisper exchanges and reads naturally goal-driven, but the grandmother's explanation and Mira's responses are functional rather than character-distinct. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with the storm's intensification, though peak-beat diction sometimes favors poetic gloss over embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-person close. Perceptual signature is strong: the guardian's silent, attentive filtering dominates. However, diction in peak beats leans purple ("spiralingly calm," "half-spoken secret," "stillwater tension") and occasionally crosses into ornamental lyricism that slows momentum. Sentence stems vary, though constructions like "She [verb], [noun] [gerund]" recur. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are voice-motivated. The prose texture is consistent but risks overwriting under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates purposefully ("She heard unspoken words the way other people heard wind"). Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("forests of second thoughts," "stroke of amplified quiet") that fits the fabulist tone. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Ellis's "I knew you'd hear it" and Mara's coaching cadence ("soft, deliberate, every word a square") feel voice-appropriate. However, elevated metaphors pervade most sentences even during high-pressure beats ("magnetic grotto brightened; iron leaves lifted"), risking density overload without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable and the perceptual signature is strong—Lira filters the world through dock-worker physicality ("coiling hawsers instead of fists") and the scrimshaw's tactile charge. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with her background: "impotent," "cetacean choir," and "unmarked map the whale etched" read more literary than lived-in. Free indirect style is clean, and the voice modulates purposefully under pressure, but the register drift in peak beats nudges the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable distance. The performer's perceptual signature—labeling scrape as "dirge," narrating to dried flowers, framing actions as performance items—remains consistent and voice-specific. Diction ("emotional void that passed for voice," "infant made of endings") is purposeful and character-particular. Dialogue between performer and officer carries subtext and goal pursuit without convergence. The crow's speech ("Whittle me a space where guilt fits like a splinter") stretches plausibility slightly but reads as deliberate surrealism taught by the post-mandate world. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally at the planting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV maintained throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—her way of noticing privileges acoustic ("A-flat," "harmonics") and textural metaphor ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; elevated register ("recusant," "phoneme," "ordinance") fits a poet focalizer. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (repeated noun-verb inversions, lyric parallelism) are taught early and held to closure. No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to judge; psychic distance remains stable, and the prose rhythm modulates from contemplative opening to accelerated crossing without register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Milo; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: colorblindness shapes what he notices, and the marble eye's revelation charges his vision. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a colorblind painter's lexicon ("discordant notes," "innocently cunning," "courageous act of remaining broken"). Dialogue is minimal (one exchange, line 6-7) but functional; Rosa's "Trade you" carries subtext of shared failure-as-currency. The piece leans toward lyric compression; some elision (the three-day arrangement conversation, the evening collaboration) is purposeful but borders on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice toggles between lyric ("prism-song bell ringer") and abstract philosophizing ("texture of connection," "artificial pilgrimage") without a stable perceptual signature. The bell ringer's diction is elevated and uniform even under the pressure of confronting the collectors, lacking stress-driven compression or character-specific syntax. The collectors speak once in unison ("their voices rough with disuse") but carry no individual idiom. Register drifts into essay mode in the final paragraphs: "true pilgrimage moves forward, artificial or not, propelled by the courage to question everything we think we know about mourning."

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable. Diction elevates into lyric register ("slipstream of lost hopes," "curtains of intention") consistently, so no mid-voice break, but the vocabulary exceeds a grief-stricken artisan's probable lexicon during high-pressure reflection. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as ornament rather than taught pattern. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through the cartomancer's professional idiom: "secular relic promising dimension instead of destiny," "cultural barometrics," "ghost protocol." Perceptual signature is consistent (geometry, measurement, inherited responsibility). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Diction remains elevated and voice-specific throughout, though some constructions veer toward ornamental density ("leveraged hope," "fractal of leveraged hope") that prioritizes lyricism over clarity under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("I will multiply paths...") reads more as incantation than spoken goal-pursuit, which fits the ritualistic tone but offers no subtext or character distinction test. Psychic distance is controlled; no unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited is stable, but psychic distance is uniformly far; the narrator's perceptual signature is ornate and interchangeable rather than character-specific. Diction remains elevated throughout ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia," "steadily unpredictable") without modulation under stress. No dialogue appears. The prose reads as a single authorial voice describing the historian rather than inhabiting her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture: "bruise the horizon," "shadow unbound," "luminous regret." The perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices dusks, light, and the stone's changes—and diction fits her role as a scholar-observer. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with embodied immediacy: phrases like "the metamorphosis began not in the sky but in the stone" read more writerly than character-bound. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (e.g., "softly, deliberately") are taught early and support the lyric mode. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Miren's perception with a distinct lyric texture: "tail tip trembled, a tiny paintbrush dipped in moonlight," "orange tongues licked the margins clean." Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (the shedding beats) and opens slightly for the final release. The prose carries a consistent contemplative rhythm without head-hopping. Minor register drift: "twin-born motivation" and "immaculate reputation that had let the con flourish under her halo" reach slightly above the established voice in a peak beat, though they remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a highly elevated, lyric register ("meteor hush of pre-dawn," "braiding with radicles that tasted of rust and morphine"). The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent—botanical, medical, and memorial diction. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. However, the register strain is considerable: phrases like "chlorophyll code" and "cellulose thread, teaching me that scars are simply stories written sideways" push toward abstract poeticism that risks distancing the reader from embodied urgency. The final lines ("go teach the silence to speak kindly") verge on thematic echo. Under peak stress (underground, reopening wound), the diction stays elevated rather than compressing into sharper immediacy, which slightly flattens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV (Mara) with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: she overlays "remembered brightness" on present gloom, notices wax smells and light as metaphor. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("incubate the leftover feelings," "hushed thunder outside") without register breaks. The metaphoric density is voice-motivated but occasionally stacks ("silent lightning," "white sprocket holes") in ways that risk opacity under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose maintains rhythmic control, though the uniformly poetic register flattens urgency in pivotal beats where sharper compression might heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and tightly controlled: "moonstruck dreamer," "unwritten calendar of nights," "migraine of unborn constellations." POV remains stable in close third, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightening during the aurora descent, widening slightly for the memory of the five-year-old self). Diction matches the protagonist's perceptual signature—star-struck, metaphor-saturated—without register drift. The prose texture is consistent under pressure, though the density of figurative language occasionally risks slowing momentum in non-peak beats. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric-archival texture: "divergent archive of all the hours," "wave functions, probability clouds," "fractured lullaby." Perceptual signature is consistent—scientific metaphor layered over mourning ritual. Diction remains elevated and purposeful, matching the guard's trained detachment. No dialogue appears; internal access is sparse but coherent. Psychic distance stays consistent; the narrator knows only what the guard perceives and infers. Purposeful compression (elliptical phrasing, fragment-like clauses) is taught early and sustained, avoiding mid-beat opacity. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear but serve the meditative rhythm rather than dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with elevated lyric diction ("hum of insight vibrating inside her skull like a tuning fork struck by moonlight"). However, the register is uniform and ornate across both calm and crisis beats, lacking modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent (philosophical-surreal) but not character-specific; the philosopher's interior voice could belong to any mystical seeker. The jaguar's dialogue ("To rediscover the wild frontier of your mind, you must give away the thing that keeps you rooted") reads as thesis delivery rather than a spoken utterance shaped by situation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited narration maintains stable distance and employs a consistent lyric register ("shoreline lullaby quality," "breath on cold glass"). Voice texture is purposeful, with elevated diction and rhythmic parallelism that support the twilight tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into exposition that explains rather than trusts image ("understanding that the hound's crisis mirrored that of many travelers she'd comforted"), and dialogue carries minimal subtext—characters articulate theme rather than pursue goals obliquely.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to the bellhop's perceptual signature: he counts heartbeats instead of seconds, tastes metal and old songs, reads meaning in the boy's trapped-bird pulse. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence," "meltwater constellations"—though occasionally elevated beyond the bellhop's plausible register. No dialogue; the silence decree is honored structurally. One minor filter-verb stack in the dream paragraph ("He would wake...unsure whether") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "dissolved into an iron gall ink pellet," "voice calm as closed winter"), purposeful compression, and lyric patterning create a fairy-tale-mythic register. Single-POV focalization remains stable; no head-hopping occurs. The pretender's brief interior glimpse ("pride muffled caution") stays within plausible third-limited bounds. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction—"the ache of drift," "threading through his veins like cold starlight"—that prioritizes ornament over immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered clue, one declaration) and functional. The voice modulates purposefully at the sundering ("Behold the signature of drift"), but the titan's perceptual signature is generic nobility rather than character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable with Mira's perceptual signature (coral through dive mask thick with tears, eel waking in chest). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, consistent with a lyric-inflected witness voice. Purposeful compression (fossil fuel ban, vanished reef, satellite charts) anchors efficiently. Two register slips weaken peak moments: "assembly of clues" and "periodically eternal" feel imposed rather than voice-native. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between reflective opening and urgent descent. Free indirect style is clean, though some syntactic patterns repeat (participial openers, em-dash asides).

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: "soles tasting the dust," "dumb metal flowers," "peppercorns flung into blue soup." POV remains stable in close third with a consistent perceptual signature (sound, vibration, visual metaphor). Diction is controlled and poetic without slipping into generic lyricism. However, peak-pressure moments suffer from filter stacks: "she felt it as vibration," "she thought of the mess," "she understood the rebellion's lull." These dull immediacy during the crane climb and climax. The final paragraph's syntax—"She whispered… then punched"—maintains rhythm under pressure. Strong voice with minor distance-control slips in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Nara's perceptual signature clear (plant-gossip, bomb-crater orchids, cedars). Diction fits voice ("little peach," "genetic priests," "conspiratorial pride") and modulates under pressure without register drift. The guard's interior ("smiled dreamily") briefly leans toward head-hopping but reads as external observation. Dialogue is absent; all advancement runs through action and interiority. Psychic distance tightens cleanly during the grotto sequence. Minor: "accidentally telepathic" as a phrase borders on telling, though the ability is dramatized immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices plant names, resin smells, and translates trauma into botanical taxonomy. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("I think: grief is not a landmine…") without filter-verb clutter. Diction remains voice-consistent—slightly elevated but character-plausible for someone who learned Latin names as coping mechanism. Minor slip: "quietly talented because I can name every plant" reads as self-diagnostic rather than shown contradiction until the somatic exercise demonstrates it. Purposeful compression in final lines ("diligence begins") fits the earned shift. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-close throughout with a lyric, elevated register that suits the tone. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphor-dense, question-driven, abstract. The repeated rhetorical questions feel character-particular rather than generic. However, psychic distance occasionally drifts omniscient ("villagers will find," "the question will be answered by the waves") in the final paragraph without clear temporal shift, and the diction ("luminescent ache," "negative space") risks over-poeticizing at peak beats where concrete sensation would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in tight third on Kael; perceptual signature (pink eyes, gloved touch, "desert's language") is character-specific. However, register drifts into elevated academic phrasing under pressure: "consciousness wild and untamed," "temporal anomalies," "temporal fold," "time's elasticity." Lyra's journal voice ("drowning in consciousness") reads indistinct from narration. The final paragraph ("Somewhere in the folded moments…") adopts omniscient summary that breaks the tight-third focalization established earlier, undercutting distance control at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the shaft crawl, pulling back slightly for the city's response). The voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated texture—"dangerous liaison letter," "live coal in the sub-zero gloom," "silent aurora guiding eyes"—that suits an archivist's formal register, though under peak stress some diction choices ("pedagogical gift" is avoided, but "scandalous gift" and "dormant networks" feel more authorial than character-particular). No head-hopping; perceptual filter stays consistent. One slip: "the blink that follows surprise" appears both in Sera's interiority and later in the city's collective reaction, blurring whether it's her phrase or narratorial. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, though a few lines ("a woman half ice, half fire") lean toward poetic summary rather than embodied perception. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters consistently through Mira's horticultural expertise and grief. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices how canvas weave resembles her mother's hands, how roses bloom brighter where blood soaked earth. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("engraved quiet," "senselessly perceptive") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Diction at peak moments (grafting sequence, final planting) maintains clarity and emotional texture without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "when patterns break themselves," "emotions visible as colored smoke," "off-key humming." The perceptual signature is consistent (synesthetic, metaphor-dense) and heightens under pressure. However, elevated diction ("transliterating," "thirsty artery," "watercolor repentance") occasionally drifts above the grounded fisher's lexicon without clear voice motivation, and the density remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature ("smelled of ink and thunder," "devotedly observant"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("I'm here to make them confess"). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats—"aphelion drifting like a bored planet deciding to leave home"—which reads more authorial than character-filtered during crisis. The voice is consistent but the register occasionally drifts from Cordelia's immediate experience into essayistic commentary. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the tattooist; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the console interaction and retrospective vision. Voice carries a distinct lyric-poetic register ("meteor hush," "sawdust that smelled of nursery pine") that remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("tonal ache," "sleeper code," "firmware") that feels imposed rather than filtered through the tattooist's idiom. The retrospective vision ("Time folded tighter; she saw herself years earlier") is clean but the perceptual signature—how she notices under stress—remains generically poetic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature (artistic, synesthetic filtering: "lilac unease became a color she could feel on her skin"). Diction is lyric and purposefully compressed ("spirals within spirals, each grain a syllable"), with no head-hopping. Figurative density is high throughout ("mist forgot its own name," "emergent hush thickened"), which fits the accumulative lens but risks overwriting in some beats—e.g., "the grotto responded by lowering its already nonexistent voice" stacks metaphor on abstraction. The piece teaches its patterned, elevated register early and holds it, so the texture reads voice-motivated rather than artifactual, though some readers may find the sustained lyricism at odds with narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance and perceptual signature are consistent (touch-focused, reflective). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("retrocognitively trapped," "gentle radical," "Iron Cradle"). However, the narration occasionally slips into elevated register ("empathy's armor," "living document of the city's wounded healing") that feels imposed rather than organic to the focalizer's texture. The final two paragraphs shift to external summary ("They never discovered," "became legend"), loosening POV modesty. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited to the ghost, with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: synesthetic coloring (citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret; echoes as scents; voice as gold spirals; words tasting of iron). Dialogue (Lila's two lines) is brief, natural, and goal-driven. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("forbidden flavor," "chords of perfume," "narrative clock") that edges past the ghost's established idiom. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The final paragraph maintains texture ("translucent ribs") without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Mira's perceptual signature (attention to light, pattern, crystalline structure) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "somatic markers") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, especially under the pressure of discovery. The single line of dialogue with the geode ("Of course you'd choose now to betray me") briefly grounds voice, but the remainder relies on summary narration that lacks rhythmic variation. Filter verbs ("watched," "realized," "understood") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Aera notices thermal glyphs, translates emotion into topography, and experiences memory as sensory flood. Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent ("turquoise hush," "lowing of glaciers," "hush that follows a final lullaby"), fitting a science that "crossed into the factually mystical." Two frictions lower the score: first, filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("driven by one thought," "ache older than grammar") dilute immediacy at key beats; second, the fossil's radiance delivers memories in exposition-dense interiority ("elm crowns shading council fires, lovers carving initials...") rather than through Aera's embodied processing. No dialogue to assess. The voice remains singular but prioritizes texture over propulsion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent lyric register—"every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed"—but the narrative voice remains uniform across emotional beats, never modulating under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (buttons grouped "by the pitch of the grief that loosened them") yet the syntax and diction stay elevated throughout, limiting the sense of a mind degrading or sharpening under stress. The one line of indirect dialogue—"the future is a garment we button together"—reads as thematic pronouncement rather than goal-driven speech. Filter verbs ("she felt quietly inspired") are sparse but present at key moments, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a controlled lyric register; perceptual signature (mist, silver, tilt, slate, zephyr) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction elevates purposefully ("vouchsafed," "zephyr curling," "cipher") and matches the spy-craft world. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solo mission. Minor register drift: phrases like "quarterly profits" and "the new scar tissue pulling tight as if smiling for the first time in years" briefly shift toward expository clarity rather than the focalizer's immediate perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV holds stable with the coachman as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the sensory filters (tingling palimpsest, weight of the sphere) and the diction reflects a measured, slightly archaic idiom consistent with his thirty years of crossings. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound: "percolate through ambient awareness," "spindrift serenity," "palimpsest promise" recur as ornamental phrases rather than the coachman's lived vocabulary. The girl's single line of dialogue ("when the gutters stop ticking, the crossing will sink") is functional but generic. Psychic distance remains stable but the voice converges toward a uniform lyric texture under pressure rather than tightening to the coachman's specific mental state. Free indirect style is clean where present.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, contemplative, with a potter's tactile idiom ("clay remembers," "glazes in a slow kiln," "unfired hive"). POV remains third-limited to Lin; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, dipping close for sensory immediacy ("thumb to leaf," "heat of her steady pulse") and pulling back for reflective patterning. The prose carries a meditative rhythm apt for the zen-minded protagonist. Diction is elevated but consistent, avoiding register drift. Minor issue: some metaphoric density ("time stitched itself," "radiant wall between" past and future) flirts with abstraction under pressure, though it remains legible. The child's brief appearance maintains narrative stance without leaking interiority. No dialogue appears; not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Mara; perceptual signature is strong in gardening idiom ("pinch tomato suckers," "speak to soil") and pragmatic-wistful diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("felt the quivering hush") to wider framing ("the lockmaster's tooth, mission finished"). Dialogue is minimal, functional, and carries subtext: "See? Every oar is a promise" teaches without sermon. Register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("phosphorescence," "parchment held to fire") that, while beautiful, edges beyond Mara's established voice under peak pressure. The boy's interiority is inaccessible, appropriately, but his silence risks passivity rather than charged withheld speech. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The rhythm control is strong but some metaphoric density in high-pressure beats (lock as midwife, moon as comb) slows immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in the gryphon's perceptual signature: "bronze feathers rang, atomically reflective," "the brittle awakening," "the precise loneliness she now sought to alchemize." Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated for a mythic register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the sternum crack, wider at the library's respiration). Minor deductions: some constructions edge toward ornamental complexity ("atomically reflective surfaces scattering the chorus into prismatic shards") that slightly obscures immediacy, and a few beats ("the shadow became a stylus") rely on metaphor density that could flatten momentum. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with lyric compression ("a thought too delicate to speak aloud," "an installation no larger than a sigh"). The perceptual signature filters setting through the ghostwriter's idiom (letters as "silk scarves," doves as "paper airplanes"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon ("prismatic quiet," "verdigris"). The piece teaches its patterned, lyric mode early and sustains it through closure, but the final exchange ("We know") flirts with anthropomorphized consensus without clear dramatization of who or what responds.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct: "thumb tilting a balance scale," "chipped silver coin," "gritty lullaby that tasted of copper and thunderstorms." Perceptual signature is consistent—technical detail filtered through her expertise and exhaustion. Psychic distance tightens during peak pressure (02:17) without losing coherence. Minor deduction: a few phrases approach stock lyricism ("ethereal hush of predawn," "old bone") and the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sky-calm," "braided with moonlight") that, while voice-motivated, flirts with overwriting. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (geometric awareness: "parallel rails bowed outward," "enormous unseen arc"). Diction matches Arin's professional lens: "translucent vellum," "meridians," "timber sleeper." Voice modulates effectively under pressure: short clauses during claustrophobia ("chest tightened"), longer syntactic arcs during spatial observation. Minor slip: "wistfully necessary" in paragraph 6 edges toward authorial register rather than character thought. Psychic distance deepens appropriately at the mirror chamber, and the final paragraph's cooler tone signals resolution without severing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric—"mist clung to Juniper's coat like guilt," "each line was a lance…of surgery"—and maintains internal coherence. The single-POV filter is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("methodical bones," "convulsed awake like a heart shocked by paddles") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-particular, and the detective's brief dialogue at the gate ("Here is the evidence…") carries a formal cadence that risks sounding declarative rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is poetic and consistent, with a perceptual signature tied to Mara's archival sensibility (ink bled into semaphore shapes, micro-maps, salt-cipher). Psychic distance is stable third-person limited. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies," "gravitational pull of legacy"), and the dialogue between Mara and Voss—especially the question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?"—reads as thematic articulation rather than naturalistic speech under pressure. The final paragraphs shift into a summary mode that compresses weeks of cataloging, flattening immediacy. Diction remains controlled and purposeful, but the voice does not always reflect Mara's mind under stress—some lines read as narrator wisdom rather than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and diction is purposefully elevated ("fermata held until breath itself became suspect"), but the register drifts into abstract lyricism ("wireframe waiting for skin," "rasterized yet kind") that flattens the fiddler's perceptual signature under peak pressure. Psychic distance widens when metaphor replaces embodied perception. No dialogue is present to judge. The prose reads as authorial performance rather than character-particular thought during the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Jonah; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is distinctive and lyric: "moth wing," "polished calm," "dusky harmony" recur with purpose. Mara's voice ("dissuade a person from panic") and the startup jargon ("pivot tables, investor ghosts") provide brief contrast, though both characters' speech tilts toward the same elevated register. Free indirect style is clean. One pattern: repeated "polished calm" and "territorial markers" phrases risk template cadence, but the lexicon remains voice-consistent and no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyric-inflected ("her fingers still smelling of ink," "star-charts rustled like sleeping birds"), with purposeful compression and patterned diction. POV remains stable third-person limited on the chronicler. The boy's dialogue (constellation names only, then her human name) is minimal and effective. However, the switch to first-person plural at "we stood inside both places at once" is unmotivated mid-paragraph head-hopping, though brief. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at emotional peaks (the chronicler's interior monologue, the boy's tears), and the prose texture is distinct, but the elevated register ("electromagnetic winds," "spectral ink") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into ornamental abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable distance throughout; psychic access remains close to Briar's perceptual signature (trees as "siege towers," apples as "skulls," roots as "comrades"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a distinct rhythmic texture: "the words scraping out like blades withdrawn from wet stone." The prose compresses under peak stress (the seventh-circle beat) without losing internal texture. Minor slip: one instance of filter-verb stack in the opening ("had come," "had shattered," "had steamed") slightly dulls immediacy, though voice-motivated by the retrospective framing. No head-hopping, no register drift; the perceptual stance is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV first person maintains stable focalization with a distinct perceptual signature: "filament of my entangled feet tingle with tomorrow's memories," "lungs fizzing with anxious elation." Vocabulary is controlled and voice-motivated (root-bound, sap-and-circuitry, hedge-scars). However, elevated diction ("root-bound visionary," "eclipsed covenant," "monoculture of glass") in high-pressure beats drifts toward label-speak, slightly flattening immediacy. Free indirect thought and tense remain consistent. No dialogue appears. Under peak stress (grafting), compression is purposeful but some lines ("vegetable code into flesh") edge toward conceptual abstraction rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "holes that whistled," "memories leak out like coins through torn cloth," "dusky resolve...like twilight that refused to become night." Psychic distance is stable first-person, filtered through war trauma and urgency. Lira's interiority remains external except via gesture ("fiercely gentle," eyes "soft yet incandescent"). Diction stays character-specific under pressure. Minor: "inlaying meaning everywhere" and "damned inlayed meanings" edge toward meta-commentary, though the narrator's irritation keeps it in-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mason; perceptual signature is clear (sound-tech vocabulary, tactile object focus). Voice modulates effectively from bitter retrospection in the opening to grounded repair work to lyric resonance at the echo moment. However, several register slips mar the texture: "confidently uncertain" is authorial diagnosis not Mason's diction, and "wrest beauty from what remains" in the final paragraph reads as thematic summary rather than his lived thought. The foreman has no dialogue, a missed opportunity for subtext and voice distinction. Sentence rhythms occasionally flatten into template cadence ("He realized... to wrest... to let... to keep").

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and purposeful, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices in translator's idiom (cuneiform micro-glyphs, phonemes, equations). Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative never head-hops. Two slips lower the band: "touching distance, she thought, is the span between fingertip and memory" reads as exposition rather than lived perception, and the mother's direct speech ("Measure the interval…") shifts into a slightly elevated register that, while poetic, isn't fully grounded in Mira's embodied experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled and richly textured, with distinct diction ("titan-gear librarian," "wintersun serenity," "the lock and the key broken together"). POV distance is stable third-person limited; focalization remains consistent. No dialogue appears. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound—lines like "memory kept by machines is only storage, but memory kept by water is story" read as thematic assertion rather than the librarian's specific perception. The voice is singular and purposeful, but perceptual signature could be more concretely character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—syntactic variety, purposeful cadence shifts, perceptual signature rooted in Mara's inspector training ("doors ajar by rusted longing," "mineral ear"). However, under peak pressure (confession, crown-wearing, mirror entry) the diction remains elevated and slightly distanced; we never hear Mara's unmediated voice in dialogue or raw interior monologue. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "knew") cluster at key turns, dulling immediacy when dramatization would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV first-person-limited voice is maintained with no head-hopping. Diction is character-particular ("daringly methodical," "lithium ghost," "raw solace") and the perceptual signature (river chronicler's mapping metaphors, embodied medication withdrawal) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the tunnel, reflective on the platform). Minor: some constructions lean purple ("accordion's wheeze mirrored her own faltering lungs," "tears diluted the lithium residue") and a few beats use filter verbs ("heard a distant trickle," "feeling the sentence vibrate") where immediacy could be tighter. The final paragraph's cadence ("daringly methodical no longer about dosage but about direction") feels slightly over-engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register and the perceptual signature is selective (phosphorescent tiles, mist, gold thread). However, the prose recycles elevated stems across beats: "Between two fateful letters" opens two paragraphs, "Through propagation delays" recurs without evolving meaning. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") stack in the second half, dulling immediacy. No dialogue. The cipher's all-caps pronouncements break diction and read as authorial rather than world-embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and employs a lush, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise. Perceptual signature is present in the "mulberry ache" and plant-gossip filtering, though these feel more decorative than character-specific. The prose occasionally slips into unmotivated syntactic complexity ("the violin wanted to return home, and it whispered that home was here, where the constellations were pinned back by velvet curtains instead of gravity") that prioritizes metaphoric density over moment-to-moment clarity of thought.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose establishes a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression ("breath catch like a held note," "time moved like honey through a sieve") that coheres across the piece. However, the elevated diction—"lucidly watchful," "radiant hush," "lattice of her bones"—occasionally drifts into abstraction that distances the reader from embodied perception. The protagonist's internal voice remains consistent, but psychic distance is uniform; no modulation under the peak beat (dispersal) that would reflect stress or surrender. The final image is vivid but the POV fades into spectacle rather than a character-specific way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on the caretaker, with vivid perceptual signature ("grape-cooled air," "scallop-winged moths"). Diction is elevated and lyric ("umbral grotto," "tannin," "fermented forgiveness"), fitting the mythic tone. However, vocabulary drifts into register mismatches—phrases like "the law of the cycle: rebirth demands a death" sound expository rather than filtered through the caretaker's consciousness. The boy's dialogue ("I am the next you, born the instant you forgave") feels too perfectly articulated for a figure smelling of tannin and described as dissipating moth-dust. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the final paragraph's omniscient summary ("the valley no longer counted debts") steps outside the caretaker's knowledge frame.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric-philosophical register. Diction is dense and metaphor-laden throughout ("conscience-for-hire," "moral radiation," "protective vulnerability"), which fits the allegorical texture but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sincerely insincere" as visual perception strains credibility). The geologist's brief dialogue carries subtext, and Mira's offer modulates voice under pressure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is stable third-limited on Elara, with elevated diction ("sycamore hush," "quantum foam") that fits the meditative tone and her academic identity. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful. However, the shift to Marcus's perception in the ring-visions and final paragraphs introduces mild focalization drift without a clear break; "Marcus saw himself aging backwards too" reads as omniscient assertion rather than his lived realization. Filter verbs ("saw," "knowing," "understanding") stack in the final third without dramatized micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent elevated register, but the narrative voice converges with the mystical subject matter into a single generic "spiritual quest" idiom that lacks character-specific perception. Diction remains uniform regardless of pressure: Cael's interior voice in the opening ("rhythm that beat against his ribs") is indistinguishable from the climactic moment ("became the echo his grandmother had sent him to find"). Filter verbs ("he knew," "he understood") stack heavily in the second half without dramatized realization, dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, perceptual signature is selective (printer toner mixed with lilacs, lumens as ration units), and diction stays consistent with a bookish mage's idiom. The single line of dialogue ("I'm looking for the sacred in the simple") feels slightly thesis-y but is anchored in the on-page moment and moves the mist to respond. Minor register drift: "accommodates impossibilities the way a drunk accommodates regrets" and "quantum of patience" edge toward authorial cleverness rather than Elian's stress-state voice. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person POV remains stable. Diction is lyric and consistent ("meteor hush," "hiding behind truth," "the color of sound"), though the register stays elevated throughout without modulation under stress. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("Jin believed," "Jin realized") are sparse. The perceptual signature is poetic but uniform; sentence rhythm and lexicon do not shift with pressure, and the voice reads as authorial rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person close on Lira; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with high-register diction ("ambered," "wavelength align," "backwards prophecy"). Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-specific—the elevated syntax does not modulate under emotional pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") appear but fit the contemplative voice. The final third introduces abstract noun clusters ("quantum beacon," "necessary dissonance") that drift from Lira's embodied experience into authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; the reaper's perceptual signature is consistent (frost on fingertips, clicking jaw, hollow chest). Register occasionally drifts into elevated academic diction ("sacrifice crystallized," "cognitive smoothness") that feels more authorial than grounded in the reaper's interiority. The voice modulates with pressure (short syntax during the copper-mirror beat, longer lyricism at the end) but some metaphors stack densely without clear propulsion. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. One elision (the plague-cot memory) arrives late without prior cue, reducing earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean, with perceptual signature in salt-crusted metal, rust as rebirth, and water tasting like "iron and memory." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the drip-counting, pulling back for the years-long span). The dolphin's dialogue feels slightly elevated but is brief and mythic by design. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Marisol's perceptual signature is distinct (professional vigilance, memory-triggered detail like "anise and rain"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("damp gauze," "mirrored hush"). No dialogue present; internal rhythm modulates well under emotional pressure. One slip: "arranged to expunge something—not evidence of crime, but evidence of choice" reads slightly expository, a helpful-narrator moment that edges out of Marisol's immediate perception into interpretation that could be more dramatized through her physical handling of the photos.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (alchemist notices prime numbers, copperplate ink, mica mirrors). Diction is controlled and lyric, matching the fabulist register. Filter verbs ("feeling," "saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. However, elevated register is dense throughout—"axiom and astonishment," "substrate," "harmonics of the same chord"—and at peak pressure (touching the drop, transformation) the prose maintains ornate phrasing rather than compressing or fragmenting under stress. Rhythm varies purposefully, though some syntactic parallelism (repeated "the first...") flattens momentum. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the watcher notices patterns, wingbeats, and signal cadences through professional filter. Diction stays consistent (attentive, cataloging, revision) and modulates under pressure without register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the glider encounter. Two frictions: some filter-verb reliance ("feeling its weight," "seeing the pilot's mask") in peak beats dulls immediacy, and a few elevated constructions ("fibers of her muscles," "bruised the horizon") drift slightly above the established technical voice. No head-hopping, no POV leakage; the instructor's radio voice is externalized cleanly. Elision (three-year backstory) is purposeful and anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer; no head-hopping into Zero's interiority. Diction carries a lyric, heightened register ("slicing through pretense," "metronome against numbness") that reads consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing the ritual. However, perceptual signature feels generic—Mara's way of noticing could belong to many narrators—and the prose occasionally tips into exposition ("the paradox that had saved them") rather than trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with tight psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "memory, he believed, could be tended, coaxed, maybe even restored" and "hope shredding muscle" reveal Ellery's internal idiom. Diction remains character-consistent even under peak stress ("macerated itself against his ribs" fits the mechanical-music frame). Minor register drift: "the afterimage of laughter, the way night sky holds the glow of a spent firework" reads slightly elevated for a grief-stricken father in a tunnel at night, though it stays within literary third-person bounds. No head-hopping; the wife's chuckle is observed from outside, preserving focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is lush and distinctive, with a bookish-feral perceptual signature: breath as "suspended commas," fur as "forgotten marginalia," paw prints as "turning pages." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the guardian's way of noticing is consistently filtered through bibliographic metaphor. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's embodied present ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity," "negative space between breaths")—these phrases read more authorial than feral-cataloguer. The prose modulates with pressure (shorter clauses as she approaches the boundary, longer cumulative sentences during reflection), but the uniformly metaphorical texture flattens some peaks where sharper immediacy would serve.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited. However, diction oscillates between archaic-literary ("vivify," "aludel," "myrrh and ozone") and modern-conceptual ("graduated pipette," "successive approximation") without clear character justification—the register reads more authorial than alchemist-specific. Narrative certainty is high throughout; the alchemist "alone could hear" the blessing's hum, yet this privileged access is asserted rather than discovered. Perceptual signature is generic elevated rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct (poetic compression, metaphor-dense syntax, selective attention to frequency and light). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, tightening at the tuning moment, opening into lyricism at closure. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon—"serenely electric vacancy," "filament for the unheard," "pregnancy with every voice"—creating a homogenous lyric texture rather than a mind under pressure. The prose reads as authored rather than inhabited, especially during peak beats where compression should sharpen rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV is stable; Arden's perceptual signature—humming off-key, grinning sideways, pocketing the brass caps—remains consistent and character-particular. Diction is purposeful and distinct: "the wake spread in slow motion spirals," "the moon dripped like melting silver," "a choir of refusal." No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during hourglass handling, slightly pulled back for the final image). Minor register drift: "Morse of lives almost lived" and "auroral thread" read slightly elevated for a deckhand's internal texture, though they remain legible and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or quote mechanic issues. The prose rhythm tightens during the steering sequence and breathes at the bow, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the lexicon ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary") maintains a surreal-clinical register throughout. However, diction drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the architecture of human bonds," "synapses of shared experience") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a fever-dreaming architect's embodied perception. The composite man's dialogue ("You're mapping the spaces between us") reads as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is present (she processes impossibilities "with unsettling calm") but remains generic across beats; no rhythmic intensification under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on the instructor; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture—"somber marvel," "balancedly curious," "horizons could unfold in directions no compass had ever measured"—that reads purposeful but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the lesson drifted outward, carried by currents stronger than any anchor") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the instructor's lines pursue teaching goals and the boy's question advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. However, the repeated pairing "balancedly curious" and "somber marvel" (used as both description and tone marker) borders on tic, and some lines—"navigation was no longer about arrival but about refusing to disappear"—read as thematic summary rather than inhabited thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance tightens under pressure (archive break-in, confrontation) and breathes during transit. Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters the atrium through pulse-tracing idiom ("Morse without code," "fibrillation"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Hask's "That photograph belongs to the Ministry" and Mira's calm lie carry subtext. Filter verbs ("feeling," "hearing") appear but remain voice-motivated. Diction stays within Mira's technical-yet-poetic register without drift, and the prose rhythm modulates with scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Mara's perception throughout. Perceptual signature shows in how she notices: "gold-flecked illuminant," "fractal burns across reality," technical detail filtered through spelunker's attention. Distance control holds, with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure: "auroral scars," "abyssal silence" feel more literary than embodied thought under claustrophobic stress. The technicians' single line of dialogue—Voss's whisper "without moving his lips"—feels appropriate to their liminal state. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between tight (physical sensation) and wider (understanding the signal). One register slip: "rewriting local physics to accommodate her return" reads more analytic than visceral in a peak survival beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person, and the voice carries a distinct digital-lyric texture: "defragment myself through them, spreading code across the wet fractals," "voice rough as unspooled tape," "each breath a syllable of wisdom." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ink ritual and loosens for the valley overview. The dialogue with the clerk—brief, direct—contrasts the surrounding lyricism without breaking voice.Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist notices via technical metaphor (Wi-Fi, monitor blips, defragmentation) and sensory immediacy (fogging breath, cold razors). Minor issue: "She looks up, sees a man the system says is ashes, and gasps—an exclamation point after months of ellipses" slides into meta-commentary that edges toward helpful-narrator syndrome, though the line remains character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (copper veins as metaphor for her conduit role, texture-to-sound translation filters all perception). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, voice-motivated for a ritual/myth register. However, under peak stress—the swallowing, the calcification—the prose maintains the same ornate density without compression or rhythmic shift, which slightly flattens the pressure curve. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance holds. The voice is distinct and legible, meeting competency but not exceptional modulation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with vivid constructions ("throat full of ice," "gravitationally playful fireflies," "snow collapsing") and the POV remains stable in close third throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated metaphor that strains credibility for a soil chemist under pressure: "orbiting Mara's head like gravitationally playful fireflies" and "harmony untamed swelled…incandescent" read as authorial rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—Mara's way of noticing never reflects her scientific training or the tension between skepticism and belief. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully between close observation and poetic reflection. Diction ("tarnished wonder," "sunrise heard through closed eyes") is distinctive and voice-consistent. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats ("apricot blossoms drifted upward instead of down, reversing gravity's decree"), creating a lyric uniformity that softens urgency. No dialogue appears; interiority is largely summative rather than contradictory in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Riven; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct texture—lyric, compressed, metaphor-dense—that reflects a world where weather is bottled and promises are illegal. Perceptual signature is consistent: Riven notices arcade cabinets, initials, coin slots, and postal anchors. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("foster reunion by linking absences until they become presence") that feels more authorial than character-bound, and filter verbs ("feeling their weight like collected apologies") soften immediacy at a peak beat. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's summary mode ("Riven delivered no letters that night, yet every doorstep… found a single dry envelope") pulls back from embodied perception. No dialogue is present, so naturalism and subtext tests are not applicable. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor are taught early and pay off at closure, but the register wobble in high-pressure moments prevents entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent perceptual signature: the carpenter notices "the memory of gears," "the ghost of his sanding hands," sensory anchors tied to his trade. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("rasp of sandpaper descending a flank"). However, elevated register in some beats ("the arc she had begun years ago, her landing as soft as the carpenter's first kiss on the cherry wood") pulls slightly away from the established idiom, and there is minor psychic-distance drift when describing the trapeze artist's experience without clear filter.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady, and the prose carries distinct texture: "sanely eccentric," "stellar sonnets," "topological pressure." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to interior metaphysics. However, diction drifts into academic register ("Riemannian metrics in iambic pentameter," "wave function of possibility," "strange attractor of inspiration") that reads more like conceptual showcase than character-specific perception. The graduate student and young poet remain voiceless, reducing distinctness. Free indirect style blurs at times—"She realized the scarf wasn't mapping places but mapping the absence of places"—where insight is told rather than discovered through sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mireya throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"compressed starlight and the salt of tears cried by sailors who never reached harbor"—that suits the magical-realist frame. However, perceptual signature is impressionistic rather than character-specific; Mireya's way of noticing reads as elevated authorial diction rather than her own idiom under pressure. Psychic distance floats between close and distant without clear modulation, and the final paragraph's "she would still coax from the collaboration of light and longing" shifts into summary that dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression and strong perceptual signature ("flavor of regret," "city's buried heartbeat"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the elevated diction is voice-motivated throughout. However, the narrative certainty exceeds what the focalizer can plausibly know in real time ("future travelers would call the Keybearer, though they would never know her name"), and several beats lean on stock metaphor strings ("caged behind her sternum, pecking at bone") that reduce specificity under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "chronically curious ache," "corroded sextant… inhaled her questions." Diction remains character-particular ("hands-on folklorist," "field journal… swollen with salt stains"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the sextant beat, wider at the hill conclusion). Some phrases approach elevated register ("persistent constellation of bruises") but stay within plausible narrator lexicon for a folklorist scholar.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lira. Perceptual signature is distinct: annotations on bronze plaques, shard-light metaphors, combative tenderness. Diction remains internally consistent; no head-hopping. The child's dialogue ("Triangles, and a circle almost mended") and immediate comprehension feel slightly over-articulated for age and context, lowering naturalism slightly. Register control is strong; psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("succor," "verdant," "tentonic") that fits a fable register. However, perceptual signature is generic—"insatiably creative mind" and "understood then" are filter-heavy assertions rather than embodied noticing. Psychic distance remains stable with no head-hopping, and the closing shift to wanderer mode is clean. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though some stems recur ("he struck," "he touched," "he flung") in the climax without tonal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a lyric, slightly elevated register ("interlaced hush," "man-shaped absence") that remains coherent throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elian notices fracture lines, knots, phosphorescence through a restorer's lens. One dialogue exchange ("You're grounding me" / nod) feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext of gratitude and shared understanding. No head-hopping; the fisherman's interiority is accessed only via his spoken confession. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (closer during needle work, wider during the spirit's materialization). Diction stays within an artisan-mystic register without unmotivated leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a perceptual signature: Elara notices torn edges, alignment, and "the silence was not absence but a map framed upside-down." Diction is elevated and controlled ("jagged edge dividing the inked coast," "scream wearing silence"), matching the contemplative stance. Distance modulates appropriately during the chapel entry. Minor register drift: "methodically curious nature, usually a calm lantern" reads slightly precious, and a few constructions lean lyric-abstract ("shielded openness of someone who has heard silence speak") without full embodiment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric-scientific texture—"magnesium...like unread telegrams," "spectral ionosphere"—that coheres across beats and modulates under pressure. POV remains stable third-person close on Mara with controlled distance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's lexicon in peak beats: "quietly analytic reminder," "sophisticated melancholy...like a violin chord resolving into minor." Elias's interiority is mostly bracketed, though "already forgetting the syllables of his borrowed name" briefly asserts knowledge beyond Mara's sight. Dialogue is minimal and purpose-driven ("You're late" establishes rapport; Elias's whispered contract shifts the frame), but the piece leans heavily on narrated thought rather than embodied gesture under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lyra, but psychic distance wavers—"driftingly alert" and "the world had been afraid to pronounce" drift into omniscient register. Diction is lush but uniform; phrases like "a chord unresolved," "ghost in code," "tinkersong wonder" recur as labels without evolving meaning, creating a template cadence. The echo's dialogue ("You're encoding us away") is the only direct speech and feels like thematic placeholder rather than character voice. Perceptual signature is weak; Lyra's noticing (ozone, roses, metal) reads generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: Lira notices with a servant's methodical care ("arrayed the pages…aligning edges") and her sensory filter (bergamot, frost, scattered light) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric ("frost-lensed heartbeat," "anguish dressed in confetti") without breaking focalization. The single brief line of dialogue—"the music faltered when she smiled"—is implied action rather than spoken, maintaining distance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during key moments (goggles warming, laughter). No filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (categorizing clouds by emotion, treating the telescope as confessional) is distinct. Diction is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression ("cradle for the last witness of spooled wholeness"). No dialogue to judge. Weaknesses: some filter-verb reliance ("she wondered," "she feared") and occasional register drift into elevated abstraction ("place where empty spaces remember") that, while voice-consistent, edges toward ornamental phrasing in peak beats. The final paragraph maintains clarity and rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV control is stable; perceptual signature (tactile focus, fractally precise observation) reflects the protagonist's condition. Distance and focalization remain consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully anchored to her interior voice: "identity exists beyond recognition," "possibility hasn't yet collapsed into night," "wisdom begins with admitting what we cannot know" read more essayistic than character-bound thought under pressure. The piece teaches a heightened, lyric cadence early and sustains it, so the register is defensible as intentional voice design, but some lines feel less lived-in than observed from above.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Lira's POV throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is close, with purposeful pulls to wide for scene-setting ("antique airship *Aurelia* drifted"). Perceptual signature is strong: "starlings wheeled in autumn murmurations, their shifting shapes reminding her of uncharted currents she longed to name." Dialogue is minimal but functional: the captain's "You've given her a story" and the chief's "Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn" carry goal-driven subtext. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter sentences as lamps dim). Diction is controlled and character-appropriate. Free indirect style is clean. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Brief elision of how Lira knows to read aloud is acceptable given the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is locksmith-specific (gear assortment, pins, escapements) and the prose texture is consistent, elevated but not implausible for an introspective craftsman. However, register drifts occasionally into ornamental lyricism ("silver gauze," "hauntingly bright reflection… like a twin who already knew the ending") that crowds peak beats without clear voice motivation, and the syntactic patterns (many participial openers, stacked modifiers) recur enough to flatten rhythm under pressure. Purposeful elision is minimal; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, so no penalty for compression.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Mara is stable; perceptual signature (condensation at ankles, chilling slate until dew froze) is ghost-specific. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between close (Mara's doubt, her smile) and wide (the colonists' collective action, years-later epilogue). However, diction drifts into elevated register at pressure points—"altruistic pulse travel up his soles like mild electricity," "nebula of respite," "brambled hope"—that reads more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue is absent except for the chalk messages, which serve as voice-distinct action. The epilogue's shift to omniscient observer ("children who never knew her name") is clean but dilutes the intimate lens established earlier. Sentence rhythm is lyric and controlled, though some phrases ("the paradox of brambled hope, the sweetness that stings") over-explain the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the adjuster's perception: "bruised awe," "throat cracked," tactile details of puppet and glass. Diction is elevated and lyric ("matte," "drowned numerals," "silvered backing") but remains consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; the single focalizer's perceptual signature—attuned to nested patterns, memory, and temporal recursion—is distinct. Compression is purposeful and taught early (nested lifetimes, recursive lullabies), and the final image is legible. Minor density: some passages stack figurative language heavily ("veins of mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled," "silence so complete it circled around to music") without always advancing pressure, approaching the overwriting threshold but not crossing it at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (Mara's attention to frost, warmth, mechanical rhythms). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("offhandedly exact," "ghost of warmth," "graceless beauty"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("saw," "watched") appear but fit the reflective stance. The prose modulates well under pressure (short bursts when the bird hovers, longer cadence at the final walk). One minor slip: "offhandedly exact, Mara recited" feels like an author cue rather than organic demonstration of the trait in action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual signature—polymer-chemist idiom ("foam-templated resin," "micro-actuator," "440 hertz, concert pitch")—anchoring voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("half expecting a heartbeat") to wider framing at closure. Minor density issue: some figurative language clusters without tight function ("paper-thin shell catching the light like a translucent fingernail" is vivid but ornamental in the opening). Diction remains within POV lexicon; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is third-person limited, stable to the vendor's perceptual signature: she notices algorithms in cracks, tastes absence, sees reflections that aren't faces. Diction is consistent and elevated ("parole word," "incise the day," "seed crystal trying to nucleate a world") with purposeful lyricism, though some register choices ("compiled from indexes and footnotes rather than born") feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is minimal but functional: "Second chances are priced by the gram of what you leave behind" pursues a transactional goal with subtext. The piece maintains psychic distance and narrative stance throughout, yet the relentless metaphorical density risks flattening emotional immediacy—no moment where syntax or rhythm compresses under stress to embody urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with clear perceptual signature (taste-based memory reception). Diction is distinctive and voice-motivated ("like a tongue against a broken tooth," "the pavilion opened like a throat"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts from the established voice ("emotionally contagious through touch," "subsume the emotional residue") and filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt herself drowning," "felt the fortress above them sigh"). Free indirect style is generally clean, but some constructions feel more authorial than character-particular under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mireya, and the diction carries a consistent lyric-archival texture ("borrowed starlight," "vigorous tender hymn"). However, the prose often drifts into elevated register that exceeds Mireya's plausible lexicon ("interspersing languages into a single liturgy," "ontological custodianship"). The grain elevator's one line of dialogue—"Songs are bridges; silos are islands"—feels like authorial thesis rather than the "gritty vernacular" claimed. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Mireya notices gears and lexicons, but her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited and the prose carries a distinct lyric-technical texture ("copper lace," "helix mind," "turbines bud in her marrow"). Distance is consistent except for one line—"the phrase the townsfolk spat when they saw her inventions walk backward"—which assumes community knowledge not dramatized and feels like authorial intrusion. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("fruition," "synaptic plasticity gone feral") that, while voice-motivated, strains plausibility for real-time perception under extreme stress. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric-fantasy register with purposeful compression ("drift-walked," "clandestinely luminous," "threshold effects"). POV remains stable in limited third with no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that feels more writerly than character-rooted: "threshold effects" and "spectral bands" read technical rather than filtered through Ilyra's archivist perspective. Perceptual signature is present (she counts heartbeats, reads ink shimmer) but the narration often explains her techniques in expository blocks rather than letting her expertise emerge through lived action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "symphonically minded," noticing pitches in fractures, tuning gestures to arboreal time. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("hairline cracks," "fungal webs," "almost-audible mercy"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at mapping, wider at grove-wide resonance). The prose texture is singular and purposeful. No head-hopping, elision is pattern-taught, and the compression serves the "intensely quiet" tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct elevated register ("liminal place," "transposition into a different phase"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("infinite variables of human consequence") that dilutes the tutor's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood") are frequent but voice-motivated. The syntactic rhythm is purposeful, though paragraphs share similar reflective cadence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured ("polite applause," "theatrical sincerity"), with a lyric-surreal register ("chrysanthemum of sound"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited. However, elevated diction ("overstuffed," "elongated moment") occasionally clashes with the visceral present, and some figurative choices feel imposed rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's "velvet flags of a country whose only border was the moment before noise begins" is poetically controlled but risks purple. No head-hopping; filter use is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: olfactory metaphors (seed "exhales," tide "thinks," scent "speaks honesty") anchor voice throughout. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor debt: elevated register occasionally drifts ("olfactorily sensitive," "moon-mulled violets," "cambium") without full naturalization in high-pressure beats, and a few filter verbs ("felt ambition loosen") soften immediacy. The lyric compression is purposeful and legible, but the diction peaks in density where plain urgency might serve closure better.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Aera with a lyric, elevated register. Psychic distance is consistent and filter verbs ("felt," "realized") are voice-motivated. However, diction often rises into poetic abstraction ("the whirling silence swallowed every sound," "a cathedral of unheard choir," "they spoke pressure, the way roots speak to soil") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Peak-pressure beats (arrow insertion, sapling emergence) maintain clarity but the uniform elevation across calm and crisis flattens voice modulation. No dialogue appears; solo-POV interiority is the only lens, and it reads more as narrative essay than lived perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara's POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct texture: clipped technical notes alternating with lyric image ("jellyfish halos," "dark pupil"). Perceptual signature is strong in the forensic filtering (wind vectors, fatigue fractures), and the voice modulates purposefully from flat recorder dictation to dreamlike compression at the plaza. However, phrases like "hazy precision of someone describing a dream while still inside it" tell the voice quality rather than enact it, and occasional elevated diction ("palimpsest of tomorrow's headlines") drifts from the established technical register. Free indirect thought and narrative distance remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct synesthetic filter ("violet ripples," "crimson" ice-song). Diction is elevated and poetic, matching Elian's bell-ringer role. However, register occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("oscillating repose," "acoustic amber") that reads more authorial than character-particular. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The voice texture is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure—peak moments (aurora passage, sheet ingestion) maintain the same lyric cadence as calmer beats, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice tilts heavily poetic with dense figurative constructions throughout: "avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush drank light the way dry earth drinks blood," "her lungs felt like catacombs." Diction is consistently elevated and voice-motivated, yet under peak pressure (the seam opening, the reflection speaking) the register does not modulate—every beat carries the same lyric density. Perceptual signature is present (Kaelen notices sound, silence, texture) but lacks variance; the prose reads as authored lyricism rather than character-particular thought under stress. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she understood") appear but serve clarity rather than dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Quince; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a consistent poetic register ("moon-silver," "gutter of the page," "eigenvalues of sorrow") that fits the character's metaphor-making mind. However, diction often drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("lucid turbulence," "common denominator of longing") rather than compressing into sharper specificity. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but leans toward metaphor over lived sensory bias. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent (jittery caution, wonder-seeking). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's lines carry thematic weight without naturalistic subtext. However, register drifts in peak beats: "sympathetic vibration," "germinate myth from memory's seeds," and "fertile soil between what was and what might yet be" read as elevated authorial diction rather than Elias's working-courier lexicon, triggering the −0.3 to −0.6 register-drift penalty in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (grief-colored, mystic idiom). Voice modulates effectively under pressure ("I need you still" breaking through the lies). Elision of the sister's exact death is purposeful and paid off through frost-braille and refracted moment. One friction: elevated diction ("aggregate sorrow," "mineral breath," "shifted hush") occasionally pulls away from embodied perception toward poetic assertion, especially in high-pressure beats, creating mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent ("moon-white bamboo fiber," "cider-scented rot," "taste was cider and copper and goodbye"). Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, voice-appropriate for a fable register. Filter verbs are sparse. Experimental compression and patterned syntax (e.g., recursive imagery of threads, silence, spinning) teach the pattern early and pay off at closure. Minor: some figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats ("raveling silence being pulled backward through the eye of a needle") without always clarifying causality, and occasional ornamental phrases ("stoically sparkling") drift toward decoration. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited on Thistle, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is generic: "quietly determined," "meek blacksmith" are repeated labels without character-specific filters shaping what he notices. Diction is uniform and elevated ("azure defiance," "bartered awakening") across all emotional states, showing no modulation under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance remains fixed; no shifts to intensify peak beats. The prose reads as committee voice—polished but impersonal, with no syntactic signature tied to Thistle's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature (sensory mapping idiom, technical-poetic diction: "launch drums," "sensory waypoints," "loom of strands"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (half-remembered meetings, vanished lover) are taught early and pay off at closure. Voice modulates under pressure without losing texture. Rhythmic control is strong in peak beats ("She swallows the cube like a seed"; "engines roar anew, cyclically spontaneous"). No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Elias, with perceptual signature evident in "warmly observant eyes read the tower's mute Morse" and the selectivity of what he notices (quartz stripe, rust smear, oilcloth scrap). Psychic distance tightens under pressure: "The skipper's warmly observant eyes" → "He feared the keeper might finally have stepped over the rail" → the click overhead parsed as "she was still keeping, still asking." Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon—"salt-ghost," "luminescent ache," "memory of radiance"—voice-specific without filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak. No dialogue; the silent exchange through stones and glass is the story's idiom. Focalization is controlled: Elias infers the keeper's presence from sound and arrangement, never claiming omniscience. Rhythm modulates from the longer, winding sentences of ritual ("Inside the haunted lantern room...") to the compressed final beat ("Against the starless dark..."), propelling the ending without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic and metaphor-dense ("porcelain echo that sliced the salt air and bled silver notes"), consistent but teetering on uniform elevation throughout rather than modulating with urgency. Diction ("geas," "total internal reflection," "membrane between epochs") mixes archaic, technical, and abstract registers; the blend reads voice-motivated for a mythic storm herald but risks register drift during peak pressure (the sail and navigation sequence). No dialogue present. The prose maintains rhythmic control, but the constant figurative density flattens rather than varies psychic distance, preventing the syntactic shifts that would reflect Lirael's escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single-POV focalization is clean, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows dye-master specificity (pigments, scales, iridescent patterns), and the valley-mist phrasing recurs purposefully. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats—"narrative magnetism," "story-saturated," "quietly explosive gift"—that reads more like prompt echo than Hoshiko's lived idiom under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "realized") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy when the closure moment most demands embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "split thumbnail," "canvas bag," "carpenter's chalk"—details filtered through her maintenance worker lens. Diction is elevated and lyric ("constellations of sorrow," "mundane miracles") but voice-motivated and consistent. The prose compresses beautifully under pressure: "Moonlight poured through the fractures, refracting into spectral trees" maintains clarity while charging the moment. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("rose and copper braided by invisible hands," "echoes stitched from starlight and regret"), voice-consistent across the piece. However, the elevated register occasionally clashes with the immediacy of crisis: "pain sharpened recollection" and "tuning fork struck at the heart" read as writerly metaphors rather than the keeper's lived perception under duress. The final paragraph's shift into collective we ("they walked out...communities gathered") blurs focalization without clear section break, though the dominant lens remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and employs a heightened, lyric register appropriate to the mythic tone. POV distance is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear (Elara "tasting" emotions, sensing the library's heartbeat). Minor slips: some diction veers toward overwrought lyricism ("enlarged tranquility," "woman-shaped hush") that risks obscuring rather than sharpening meaning, and Vale's brief dialogue feels slightly formal but not disruptive. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; Mila's perceptual signature (noticing drift, naming vanished streets) is distinct and consistent. Diction ("flour ghosts," "tea-steam sighs") is purposeful and voice-specific. However, elevated lyricism pervades nearly every sentence, creating a uniform textural density that flattens urgency—high-pressure beats (planting at night, pressing palm to mosaic) carry the same ornate cadence as reflective passages. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the syntactic rhythm is too uniform to modulate with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable and apt; the narration maintains a heightened, lyric register consistent with the library's "quartz hush" and the protagonist's archival role. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices "hairline fracture," "copper fittings green with age yet still warm," and translates sensory data into symbolic meaning (loyalty as "silver thread," wonder as "golden chord"). Diction remains within an elevated but consistent lexicon; phrases like "drowning in reverse" and "dandruff from a dying god" are metaphorically dense yet voice-coherent. One brief register slip: "converting the death of meaning into numbers that might outlast their significance" reads slightly over-articulated for a moment of action, edging toward thematic summary, but recovers quickly into embodied beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: contraband imagery, maritime metaphors ("slipped," "liquid night," "fish gutted on deck"), and inherited criminal diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the wait ("half-moons into my skin"), pulling back for the market overview. Rhythm tightens at dawn: "I opened my fist. The mermaid dropped…" No head-hopping; Jonah's calm is read externally. Minor: "comforting unease" and "curiosity steadfast" edge toward oxymoron decoration rather than embodied contradiction. Filter verbs ("I realized," "I felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric, with consistent texture ("tasted spring rain and winter's first snow simultaneously"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("human embodiments of atmospheric phenomena that science could measure but never truly explain") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The woman's dialogue carries suitable gravity, but the protagonist's interior voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—her way of noticing is generic rather than shaped by her skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV remains stable; the artist's perceptual signature (charcoal-smudged hands, mnemonic precision, taste of minerals) is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the character's established register—phrases like "auroral sorrow," "mnemonic rescue mission," and "gratitude ricocheting off stone" read more authorial than character-rooted, creating slight psychic distance wobble under peak emotion. The prose rhythm varies purposefully and the final dream sequence ("dates bending like crystal growth") maintains voice coherence. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout; perceptual signature is strong ("gilded leaf…glinting beneath dim grow-lamps," "humid silence"). Diction stays consistent with Aurelia's artisan perspective. The line "proving that even after the oasis dries, candor in small moments can still irrigate a city" in the final paragraph shifts into essayistic register, briefly exiting her immediate perception. Corin's arrival is cleanly handled without head-hopping, and the shared reading avoids dialogue, sidestepping voice-convergence risk. Psychic distance remains stable, with purposeful compressions during the map assembly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated diction and lyric compression throughout, with a perceptual signature filtered through the tuner's mute-season discipline ("fingertips reading micro-oscillations the way blind priests read breath-scriptures"). POV distance is stable, though some phrases veer toward abstract narrator commentary ("the color of wonder itself") that exceeds what the tuner can plausibly think mid-calibration. The purposeful compression and patterned syntax are taught early and remain legible, but under peak pressure (comet's pass, sculpture activation) the voice does not modulate—it stays ceremonial when sharper sensory immediacy might ground the tuner's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on K-17 with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent texture blending technical precision ("servos," "neural networks," "optical sensors") with lyric compression ("memory-dust," "tiny sun," "roots of code and carbon"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises, tightening from reflective observation to sensory immediacy during miniaturization. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats: "fragmented wholeness where past and future existed simultaneously in its processing core" and "resolution didn't mean elimination" read more like thematic summary than K-17's particular perceptual signature. The prose maintains legibility and no dialogue appears to test, but syntactic patterns ("The roses [verb]... The android [verb]...") recur across multiple paragraphs, flattening rhythm. Diction remains within android-consciousness bounds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Mira's curatorial idiom ("objects return to stories," "sand waits for wind"). No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible interior lexicon ("lub-dub" clinical notation, "valve none knew was pressurized") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue appears, sidestepping naturalism and subtext tests. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming to sensory immersion at the mailbox, pulling back for collective witnessing). The prose carries distinct rhythmic control, particularly in the dawn vigil sequence, and no filter-verb stacks or convergence under pressure. Minor register drift in metaphoric flourishes ("living tissue of the courtyard") but not severe enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (dancer's idiom: "pirouette of numbers," "ankles wrote cursive warnings") and voice is lyrical throughout. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats ("lyrical code breaker," "heartbeat trying to remember its rhythm"), creating register consistency but reducing immediacy under stress. The line "voice braided with bubbles" and "calf muscles spelling out the master key" border on overwrought metaphor that obscures literal action. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is controlled, though the metaphorical density sometimes abstracts Mara's concrete perception. The voice is distinct but risks becoming a sustained poetic performance rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: Miren notices gravity shifts, lantern mechanics, sailor coffee grounds. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity ("gleaming silence," "breathing rainbows"). Brief compression in the peak ritual sequence—"memories emerged like minnows"—is purposeful and pattern-taught. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter during the ritual, broader during the final walk home. Voice remains distinct and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent (cosmic metaphor, silence as substrate). However, the diction drifts into elevated register that sits oddly with the earthy ritual: "terrestrially cosmic," "murmuration of quiet," "tessellating into a single sphere of smoothed hush" read as authorial rather than character-bound. Under peak stress (swallowing the sphere), the prose maintains the same ornate texture instead of compressing or intensifying. The voice is distinctive but not character-particular; it feels like a narrator describing the summoner rather than the summoner's own mind. Psychic distance remains uniform, missing the modulation that would ground high emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    First-person POV remains stable; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the tutor's reveal and the gargoyle's speech. Perceptual signature is consistent (linguist's eye for conjugations, stress fractures, "grammar of cracked brick") and the prose carries a singular texture—lyric compression without opacity. Free indirect style is clean when the narrator channels the building's voice. The tutor's dialogue ("Language tutors...are only ever summoned by need") and Mrs. Chen's brief exchange feel natural and distinct. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, though the elevated diction ("patiently nimble," "dactyls of fire") occasionally hovers at the edge of the narrator's plausible lexicon without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Mara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric-gothic texture ("trespassing inside a bruise," "funeral clothes," "chlorophyll mist") that matches the velvet-garden setting and Mara's charged interiority. Occasional register drift into elevated diction ("resonance structures," "re-authorize what had been criminalized") reads slightly above Mara's established voice in peak emotional beats, creating minor distance inconsistency. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully between sensory immediacy and reflective stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a woman under emotional duress ("wisely enduring," "unlink herself from the chain of vengeance," "calibrated strike against tyranny"). Perceptual signature is generic; Mara's way of noticing sanctuary details doesn't reflect her forger's eye or present emotional state. No dialogue present to assess voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"taste the iron in a stranger's blood memory," "reed-blown melancholy"—and diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with the "echo singer" role. Purposeful compression and sentence fragments ("Tonight's echo differed") serve voice. However, the vocabulary occasionally drifts into stock poetic phrases ("webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs," "understanding struck like cold water") that flatten specificity under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, though some lines ("She needed to learn why") tell motive rather than showing it in choice. No dialogue appears; the weaver's single line ("My daughter learned to listen, but you learned to finish") is functional but brief. The prose modulates with emotional beats (descent narrows syntax, closure opens it), yet the narrator's internal texture sometimes smooths into neutral lyricism rather than remaining character-particular. Rhythmic control is solid, and no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage occur, keeping this in the mid-to-upper 6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is distinct and textured—"borrowed starlight," "glacier groaned like a sleeping whale," "hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness"—with purposeful compression and lyric patterning throughout. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited, and perceptual signature (dream logic, ghost-medium idiom) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("windows of connection," "collective sorrow," "tapestry whose pattern") that feels more thematic than character-particular under pressure. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("the future she is still weaving") blurs the line between Marrow's perception and authorial gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: diction (slick stone, dark commas, coaxing of fibers) reflects the philosopher's artisan attention, and perceptual signature is consistent (noticing grain, knot, absence). Purposeful compression (elliptical construction, poetic phrasing) and elevated register suit the reflective stance. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("the invisible labor inside it") that tells rather than dramatizes, and the line "demure audacity, the courage to feel wonder without shouting it" reads as authorial gloss rather than lived thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Marisol notices hexagonal scars, temperature shifts, and tessellation patterns in a way that reflects her former analytical role. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional phrases ("sharply observant eyes caught the pattern") filter unnecessarily and a few constructions ("impossibly glossy," "ghost tides") drift toward stock lyricism. The narrative voice modulates well under pressure, tightening during the reassembly and softening into the final broadcast moment. No head-hopping or POV leaks; distance stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and carries a distinct lyric-prophetic register ("cobalt glass shards," "gritty whimsy bubbling up like blood from a bitten tongue"). However, several lines drift into elevated abstraction that clashes with the visceral moments: "the residue of every future that had collapsed into this present" and "variant allegiance" read more conceptual than character-particular. The perceptual signature—radio static, frequencies, childhood lullaby—anchors voice, but the prose occasionally sacrifices immediacy for thematic declaration. No dialogue is present to test rhythm or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person POV with stable distance and a lyric-poetic texture: "bones humming with the lonesome splendor," "cathedral where gulls preached to the sand." The prose remains character-filtered and purposefully compressed. However, several constructions veer into overwrought register: "positively wistful," "gleaned redemption…brush her ribs like a cat asking to be named," "invitations…copper seeds." These moments privilege ornament over clarity at pressure points, and the final paragraph's metaphorical density ("bridge built of every voice willing to be carried") borders on abstraction that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and aptly elevated for an engineer-mystic, with controlled diction ("frequencies rather than ridges," "fleshly ethereal"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic certainty matches Mireya's expertise (she "understood the logically emotional calculus"). Filter verbs and passive constructions appear but feel voice-motivated ("was dying," "were detaching"). Minor register drift occurs in peak beats: "vibrational matching that invited the shadows to listen instead of consume" reads more conceptual than embodied under stress. The prose maintains distinct perceptual signature (resonance, sound, memory) but sacrifices some immediacy for lyric distance during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; distance remains consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated—"dropped mirror," "coin balanced on a wire," "reverse snowfall"—and the perceptual signature (tracking ricochets, reading polarity like breath) is character-specific. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses as the moon climbs, longer reflection earlier. Minor friction: a few metaphors ("twin heart of impatience," "lung full of frost") approach decorative density in adjacent lines without full payoff, though they remain legible and coherent. No head-hopping; interior access clean.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and controlled: "watchfully calm gait," "bones picked clean," "ghost signal," "small fortress of visibility" establish a measured, observational register apt for an investigator processing trauma. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightening during the childhood memory intrusion ("hit like a train"), expanding for forensic assessment. The prose reflects Mara's professional training layered over personal damage. Free indirect style is clean. One weakness: the final paragraph shifts into explanatory mode ("she would file her report—not just the empirical observations, but the story") that tells rather than shows the decision, and "guide these memories" trails off mid-sentence as if unfinished.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds Emil's POV cleanly with strong perceptual signature—"prayers felt like coins flung into a dark well," the warrant "heavier than any cassock cloth"—and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the repair negotiation, reflective for Rowan's backstory). Olya's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("A pulse can be coaxed, Chaplain, but the song it plays may not forgive you") and subtext. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("aptly deliberate" repeated, "explicates" implied in complex syntax) but remains largely voice-consistent. The phrase "vibrant hush" recurs as both setting descriptor and tonal marker, bordering on authorial intrusion but staying just within the lyric register the piece establishes early.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct baroque texture ("sour wind," "grammar of light," "chord that tasted of copper and ozone"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("transliterate the acid sea's moods into a grammar of light") that feels more conceptual than Juniper's lived perception. The Algorithm and Hunter are told rather than dramatized, reducing psychic distance control. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "steadily curious, never mocking...yet never reverent enough to kneel—her awe wore a smirk" reads as narrator summary rather than Juniper's own idiom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric-SF register ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "rattled like a dying hard drive") that modulates under pressure but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("dementia servers," "pirate frequencies") that risks aesthetic gloss over embodied perception. Free indirect access to the keeper's thought is clean. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though several metaphors stack without clear embodiment (archive as "living archive orbiting the planet"). No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, third-person limited with a lyric-poetic register that matches the mythic premise. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during empathy-swallowing, cooler during exposition of the harbor-market). Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets are moot. The perceptual signature—border-keeping vocabulary, emotional residue on objects, mirror-warping—is character-specific and sustained. Diction occasionally tilts elevated ("weighted breath before reply," "bruise-colored clouds") but reads intentional rather than register-drift.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct texture ("the fold in patience kept her fingers still," "a chime thinner than moonlight, a sound that tasted of salt and lullabies"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that clashes with immediate scene pressure: "the exact sound of approaching endings: not a scream but a sigh that keeps going" reads as authorial summation rather than Mara's lived perception. The boy's dialogue is minimal but functional; no dialogue on the page tests subtext or goal-driven rhythm. Free indirect style is clean, though the mosaic structure and time-jumps occasionally obscure whose present moment anchors the narration (e.g., "Years later, when the boy grew").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric-literary, sustained across the piece with controlled metaphoric density. POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded, especially during a solitary moment of high emotion. Perceptual signature is present (vintner's eye for grafting, terroir) but the prose rhythm stays uniform—lush, contemplative—without modulating sharply under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, oblique recognition). Diction is elevated and specialized ("kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm," "consecrate") but consistent within the walker's professional register. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose reflects the walker's way of noticing—edges, indirection, ritual steps—creating a voice-motivated filter. Minor register drift into abstraction ("raw substance of understanding") but no disruptive breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with purposeful compression and elevated diction that reads as consistent perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction ("grief," "transmutation," "collective healing") that flattens immediacy. The archivist's perceptual filter is selective and biased toward whimsy, but under peak pressure (the closure moment) the voice does not modulate—texture remains static. Elision is taught early and legible, supporting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and lyric ("suspended hush that clung to the air," "sonically reflective," "weathered innocence"). Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices books, sounds, particulars of the library. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during testimony, pulled back at departure). Brief dialogue-like moments ("possible, possible"; internal "I remember" testimony) carry subtext. However, some diction ("sonically reflective," "fractured sequences") tilts toward abstract register, and the phrase "weathered innocence" risks preciousness. Rhythm control under pressure is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a distinctive lyric-philosophical register with controlled metaphoric density: "fog sculptures shifted with the wind, momentary monuments to impermanence." POV distance remains stable throughout, filtering all perception through the prophet's particular way of noticing decay and memory. Some register elevation appears in peak moments ("imperceptible frequency where youth transitions into something else entirely"), but it remains voice-motivated rather than jarring. The piece successfully sustains its meditative cadence while maintaining forward pressure, though the uniformly elevated diction occasionally risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable; focalization remains anchored to Mira throughout. The prose carries a consistent lyric-poetic texture with purposeful compression ("a lullaby sung by metal fatigue"). However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts from Mira's plausible idiom under stress, and filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt," "understood," "knew"). No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature: she filters the ward through sound (squeak, rattle, hum) and scent (warm plastic, petrichor, citrus). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality ("borrowed time from the air," "shadows with it"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Calderon's "Thought vinyl was extinct" and Mara's "Only the intact ones" carry subtext about loss and fragmentation. Free indirect style is clean. Minor strain: "the chord she'd woven still vibrating in the air like an invisible thread" risks abstraction at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; psychic distance is consistent and the narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock lyricism—"star-threaded dome," "silk scarves pulled by invisible hands," "looms"—that flatten rather than individuate her scholarly perspective. The prose under pressure remains ornate rather than compressing: "State epoch" / "Third cycle after spoons bent reality" is crisp, but surrounding beats layer metaphor without acceleration. No dialogue beyond the automaton's single exchange, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Elara's healer lens: "willow and bone-setting song," "itching with the memory of splints"). However, the changeling's interiority intrudes: "learning the shape of human love so precisely" exceeds what Elara could witness, a brief head-hop. Diction is elevated and consistent ("nostalgic innovation," "opalized, root curled like a fetus") though occasionally risks purple density. No dialogue present. Psychic distance holds except for that single changeling access point, which prevents higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "eyes wide as lunar craters, mouth a shoreline receiving tide." Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent, fitting the star-watcher frame. However, register occasionally drifts into archaic phrasing ("zephyr bloom cool") and the narrative certainty about villagers' inner states ("feel, perhaps for the first time, unafraid") exceeds what Lira can know in the moment. Free indirect style is mostly clean but one phrase—"job completed"—reads as authorial summary rather than character voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is good; sentence lengths vary purposefully through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Perceptual signature is poetic and consistent: Mira notices spores, pendant swing, drip cadence. Distance is stable third-limited. The prose texture is distinct but occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("grafting new meaning," "peat," "digits of a signature"). Elias's brief actions carry subtext (muting the loop, copying to moss-covered USB) without dialogue. No head-hopping. Figurative density is high but mostly voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "fog curled into quotation marks," "voice like pages rubbed together," "sentences rearranging beneath her sternum." Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at Lira's appearance, wider at dawn). Dialogue is brief and goal-driven ("Take your shapes, but give me the courage to finish"). One slip: "lucidly watchful, counting heartbeats" repeats the prompt attribute without fully integrating it into micro-choices; it reads slightly ornamental in the opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("whimsical tinkerer," "verdant arbor," "gathering hush"), though it occasionally drifts into expository register ("sophisticated systems for maintaining balance"). The narrative voice is distinct but ornate, with phrases like "spun golden stories" recurring as motif. Psychic distance is controlled, filtering the ritual through Elara's knowledge and memory. No dialogue is present to judge. The voice is coherent but tilts toward poetic summary rather than immediate perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, third-person limited with tight focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: starlight, heartbeats, patterns, rhythm. Psychic distance is stable. Voice is lyric-formal, consistent in register and syntax throughout, with purposeful compression ("as if the air itself were glass," "patterns with discarded items"). The prose modulates intensity through rhythm and image density without breaking character. No dialogue to judge. Diction remains within the alchemist's poetic-ritualistic lexicon. One persistent weakness: sentence stems recur frequently ("He [verb]," "The [noun]"), creating mild template cadence, and several figurative constructs—"the hollow of his throat, where her name once lived," "inside him, the safekept starlight now echoing her heart in frequencies only absence can tune"—approach stock lyricism without fully transforming it. Distance and focalization hold cleanly, lifting the score into the high 6s.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Ansel's perceptual signature—peripherally focused, attuned to reflection and sound—is consistent and voice-particular. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstracted register that strains plausibility for a locksmith under pressure: "crepuscular hours," "stray moments," "archive of stray moments," "erased minutes," "obedient again." Psychic distance is mostly controlled, but filter verbs and metaphoric density ("wounded season," "frost on a dying breath," "bruise") stack heavily in high-pressure beats, flattening immediacy. The prose reads as the author's poetic voice rather than Ansel's mind under stress, creating a tonal gap between role and language.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the confession, observational during ritual). Perceptual signature is distinct: metallic textures, recursive reflections, weight-as-tangible-object. Diction is elevated and lyric ("whalebone reverie," "auric note," "calcifying the air") but consistent within the established voice. Two issues lower the score: the prose occasionally drifts into ornamental register that feels more authorial than character-filtered ("boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush" repeated without functional variation), and the single line of dialogue ("the day she left her sister…") shifts abruptly into plain speech without tonal bridge. No head-hopping, and the focal control remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric-textural voice ("sawdust and thunder, hauntingly practical"). Distance control is consistent, and perceptual signature reflects Mara's circus background (braided manes, safety ropes, tent stakes). However, the prose leans heavily on figurative density and elevated diction throughout, risking register drift from a grieving widow's immediate experience. Lines like "promising he would stay if she just kept the cage door closed" blur into metaphor that feels more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue present to assess, and no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and lyrically dense with a poetic, introspective register ("regret is just empathy traveling backwards," "cloudwater lapped at the copper deck"). POV distance remains stable in first-person singular with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—chronologically confused, fragment-collecting—but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ambitions erode another micron") that feels more authorial than character-lived. Free indirect style is absent; interiority is direct and image-heavy. The ghost's dialogue carries distinct voice ("You replaced our future"), but dialogue is minimal. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, moving from exterior carousel description to intimate negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Alya with a distinct lyric register (calliope chords, Möbius confession, vermillion as rehearsal). Psychic distance is consistent. Compression is purposeful and legible. The architect hologram's dialogue feels functional but slightly expository ("Design for resurrection…"). Voice modulates under pressure (cap rotating like a slow black planet, valve clearing its throat) yet several passages rely on elevated diction (stoic wonder, kinetic sculpture, vectors of intention) that holds the reader at lyric distance rather than embodying immediacy. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-close, distance controlled, and the perceptual signature is consistent: Arlen notices moss, iron, and the planet's pulse. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the reflective mode. Weakness: the prose does not modulate under peak emotional pressure; the same ornate cadence persists whether Arlen is remembering investors' laughter or placing the pendulum. Key phrase "excruciatingly gentle" recurs as authorial motif rather than character-specific idiom, slightly diluting voice ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene upheaval," "palimpsests of altered routes") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under canal-barge conditions. Riga's cigarette-and-command voice is sketched efficiently. The phrase "by the silence of morning radio" recurs as motif but reads slightly mannered. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or exposition dumps harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds Ari's perceptual filter (seed-collector idiom, rope-reader stance). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("time accordion," "midwife to every line"), which reads voice-motivated for a philosophical protagonist but risks register drift under the harbormaster's arrival when urgency might compress syntax and diction—yet it remains unchanged. Psychic distance stays stable. No dialogue beyond the two spoken lines; those lines carry goal and subtext cleanly. Harbormaster's voice ("data rot") is distinct. Some figurative density ("sleeping serpent," "harbor moons") ornaments rather than advances pressure in mid-scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate work of projecting presence") aims for a heightened register. However, the prose relies heavily on abstract concepts ("extracted presence," "geography of healing") that float above concrete perception, and the narrator's perceptual signature is not character-particular—the traveler's way of noticing does not feel distinct from the authorial voice. Phrases like "whatever force collected explained absences" and "purposeful effect" read as explaining rather than inhabiting the world through her eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric, syntactically varied, and committed to its heightened register ("bitterly sweet," "borrowed shoes," "quaking," "the word count of his life"). POV remains stable third-limited throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into self-conscious ornamentation ("the suspended palace swayed between stalactites like a corroded cradle," "a ribbon of colored wind") that reads more as authorial style than character-specific perception. The prince's perceptual signature (hypothesis, trembling reverie, apology for grave-robbing) is consistent but not sharply individuated. Peak-stress compression is acceptable, but the final meta-phrase ("word count of his life") breaks the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "cloud shadows slid across the dunes like slow bruises," "stars pierced the cloud migration...counting them like sprinkler heads." The firefighter lens filters consistently. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon under stress: "unyielding compassion," "covert platoon," "kelp-drift peace" read more authorial than interior. The prose stays clean and rhythmically controlled, but voice-specificity wobbles at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") but occasionally tips into prompt-echo phrasing that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Perceptual signature is present (Mara notices light, warmth, vibration in the box; memories as "liquid light") yet several lines read as external narration rather than filtered perception: "The geese above remained paused, their migration suspended by some cosmic hand" asserts cosmic causality unavailable to Mara's skeptic stance. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but psychic distance wavers when the prose declares thematic meaning ("a constellation of regrets") instead of showing Mara arriving at that realization.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: "calculating machine gear," "his hearts," and the nebula's "throat" all mark an otherworldly yet grounded register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the beacon encounter, wider during the final spiral meditation. Minor slip: "each petal a note in a song that approximated infinity" in the closing drifts slightly toward authorial summary, though the prior image work earns the reflection. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and lyric ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative") but remains consistent and voice-motivated for a contemplative character. Grandmother's dialogue arrives via butterfly wingbeats, a purposeful stylization that reads legibly. Perceptual signature is present (carver notices patterns, stone texture) but interior texture flattens into abstract register ("collective grief," "transformation to be undergone") at peak moments, blunting the specificity needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance tightens during the pendulum pause ("I have the space of one heartbeat to choose") and opens for the dusk return. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist notices inscriptions, machine oil, escapement wheels, and the tower's iron bones—a custodian's lexicon. Diction remains within the narrator's register: "searing reverie," "ethically diligent," "blush with orange grief" carry a formal, elevated texture consistent with forty-seven years of solitary ritual. Compression is purposeful: "For forty-seven years I have been..." and ellipses between carving and winding skip transit without losing causality. Minor slip: "they will lay me beneath the yam field" shifts to a future certainty the narrator cannot fully know, a brief omniscient leak that does not obscure the present scene. Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short beats during the carve and lash, longer syntactic waves in the dusk reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-close. Voice is lyric and elevated: "velveteen gloom," "intentions folded," "audible chords." Diction remains consistent, though some phrases—"blithe gardener," "tenderly organized heart"—feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-specific. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (chess clock, spiral, velveteen) are taught early and paid off at closure. Psychic distance is controlled; Mercy's perceptual signature emphasizes geometry, texture, and tending. Minor register drift into mythic exposition ("the next keeper of the spiral") at the end, but the effect is intentional and the closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person-limited with distinct perceptual filters ("groundedly imaginative as glacier-melt carving valleys it would never see"). Register drifts into elevated philosophical diction during peak beats: "ignorance wasn't absence but a deliberate clearing" and "the necessary vacuum before creation" flatten immediacy. The cartographer's interior voice converges with narratorial summary rather than maintaining character-specific perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean but lacks rhythmic modulation as pressure builds.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose establishes a consistent lyric register—"mist curled like forgotten sheet music," "dust remembers the bow"—but the elevated diction occasionally drifts from Mila's implied lexicon (a working copyist is unlikely to think "thistled calm" or "clouded testimony" mid-crisis). POV remains stable in third-limited, and perceptual signature (musical terms, transcription metaphors) is clear. However, the final third leans on stock constructions: "she did not flee; she kept copying" reads as summary-tell rather than embodied choice. The pirate broadcaster's voice is distinct when quoted, but Mila's interior voice lacks sentence-level variety under peak pressure, defaulting to passive constructions ("the hall filled," "inspectors burst in").

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filters all perception through Elena's artist's sensibility: "charcoal-stained fingers," sight-line calculations, the way light catches porcelain "like the mica in sidewalk concrete, like the glitter her grandmother had once mixed into paste." Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("that safety is always a mirage...that love is the powder we scatter") that feels imposed rather than organically thought in the moment, particularly in the final paragraph where multiple abstract formulations cluster. The prose remains legible and voice-motivated overall, with strong rhythmic control in the opening's converging clauses and the final spiraling sentences that mirror content.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("sedimentary layer of denial," "abrasive calm") that reflects Caldera's philosophical stance. POV distance is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is coherent (everything filtered through layers, strata, filtration metaphors), though the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("ballast, weighting the city to a preferred past"). The single line of dialogue arrives late but is distinct and thematically charged. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative certainty matches what Caldera can plausibly know through her diving and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and apt, with narrative certainty calibrated to Mara's knowledge and perceptual filter. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"traveled stillness," "velvet turned inside out," "a frequency she could now subtract"—that coheres with the ritual's contemplative mode. Diction is elevated but remains consistent; no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs. Distance modulates purposefully as Mara moves from action to reflection. Minor slip: the final paragraph shifts slightly toward omniscient summary ("neighbors would wake hearing an unfamiliar tenderness") without anchoring in Mara's present perception, though the effect supports closure rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited tracking Marisol; distance and tense remain consistent. Perceptual signature is present (she reads wind by rattled bolts, tastes memory in glass) but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register—"meristems," "volatile molecules," "synaptic plasticity"—that exceeds her embodied idiom during high-pressure beats. The sentence "between her teeth, the flavors resolved into a map of failures" demonstrates voice control, but passages like "nudging them to reroute, letting strangers wake with borrowed recollections" feel more authorial than character-filtered. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: Mara notices ozone, brass heartbeats, nectar-dusk hues filtered through her eleven-year routine. Diction is controlled and distinctive ("fragile varnish over wonder," "involuntarily truthful stare," "proboscis") and the prose modulates from meditative opening to kinetic climax. One voice slip: "When nectar dusk hardens to night, seek the spark that never burned; open the sky where drones once yearned" reads more like authorial poetry than a riddle a tech would inscribe. The boy's single line of dialogue and Mara's response carry subtext (threshold-keeper, riddle-bearer) but brief duration limits full evaluation of dialogue naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices "shingles bleaching from cedar to the color of old photographs," reads house heartbeats—anchoring voice in her profession. Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent with the hushed tone: "violet flare that did not illuminate but deepened the shadows, making them tender." One register slip: "inadvertently profound, like assembling a confession from pronouns" reads meta-commentarial rather than Elara's lived thought. Psychic distance stays controlled. The prose modulates well under pressure, tightening in the crawlspace and opening at the covenant. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect is clean, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person statue with telepathic access; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: mineral/stone metaphors ("warm ink," "calcified certainty"), synesthetic telepathy (tasting grief, feeling pulse through fissure), deliberate pacing that mirrors stone awakening to agency. Diction remains within the narrator's contemplative, newly sentient register throughout. The gardener's memory is clearly filtered as received impression, not direct access. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences during reflection; shorter, decisive fragments at the breaking moment ("I answered with the only honesty I owned: 'I am learning.'"). Minor issue: some phrases approach stock lyricism ("warm ink," "electric") and the bubble-message at the end risks slight whimsy against the established gravitas, though the voice holds coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV stable throughout; third-person limited to Elara with consistent psychic distance. Diction reflects mathematician identity: "recursive function," "sigma symbol," "sum infinite series." Perceptual signature is selective (prime steps, asymmetry, uneven clatter) and character-specific. Minor register drift: "velvet-heavy with the texture of almost—almost rain, almost laughter, almost touch" elevates past Elara's established lexicon in a peak beat, and "boundless confinement" in the opening reads slightly authorial rather than filtered through her mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, third-limited, holds stable distance and perceptual filter. Diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with the premise (saffron quiet, moon-tipped, rusted nails). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at peak beats (the visions, Jules's arrival). Weakness: syntactic uniformity—most sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrase in a recurring cadence that flattens rhythm under pressure. No dialogue present; Jules and Mira interact via gesture and silence, which fits tone but limits differentiation tests.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person close on Aurelia throughout with consistent perceptual signature (opera glasses, careful script, cultured composure). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("alchemy of displacement and determination") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. Dialogue when present is functional and natural; the old woman's rebuke carries authentic voice. The Chen family's actions show distinct agency without head-hopping. Distance control is mostly clean, though moments like "the sound of cracking ice and buzzing bees growing fainter" in the dream sequence abstract rather than embody. Overall voice is competent but not fully distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to the clockmaker. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register ("neatly inventive trap of centuries," "bleak exhilaration") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator notices symbolically charged objects (hunger stone pulsing, murals appearing) without the selective bias of a craftsman under duress. Free indirect style is clean, but no dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The phrase "bleak exhilaration" recurs four times, becoming a tic rather than a rhythmic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is dense, image-driven, and rhythmically controlled: "roadkill can look jeweled beneath headlights," "words clogged like sawdust." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person, and perceptual signature is consistent (threat and beauty intertwined). Non-standard constructions (e.g., "smearing color," "unbosom the memory") are legible and voice-motivated. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("repulsive allure," "paradoxical notes") that, while consistent, risks feeling curated rather than urgent. Single-POV piece; no dialogue present. The final paragraph modulates into clarity without losing texture. Strong control with minor register elevation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on the prophet; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("alto cumuli sliding into bass stratus," "Sea's Locked Jaw") with purposeful register. Perceptual signature is sonic-first (he hears obstacles as instruments). The piece trends lyric and accumulative, which suits the lens, but lacks rhythmic modulation under peak pressure—syntax remains uniformly lush even when the raft is stalled. Children and crew speak no dialogue; their presence is gestural only.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "quietly driven, the way a tide is quiet when it carves continents grain by grain" and "dread pooled beneath them" anchor a consistent perceptual signature. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally edges toward elevated register ("oxidized metal," "bioluminescent ink") that feels slightly outside the cartographer's immediate crisis lexicon, though it remains legible. The final image's compression ("terrible chart") and the whistle's clatter provide embodied closure. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction for one or two lines where the prose leans slightly more decorative than voice-urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (measuring shadows with "emotionally rational eyes," parallels drawn explicitly). Diction is controlled and elevated, fitting a historian's lens. The prose compresses transit efficiently and filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "imagined") are voice-motivated. Minor slip: "心跳 counting options like a metronome" intrudes as an untranslated fragment, breaking the established register without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: professional vocabulary (hydraulic lime, coring, steel spatula) blends with lyric compression ("constellations," "censers that had forgotten their prayers"). Diction remains within Mara's plausible register, though occasional elevated metaphors ("thread made of light," "anxious tessellations") edge toward ornament without undermining voice coherence. No dialogue present. Under peak moments (the dome inscription, the final walk) syntax compresses appropriately and the narrator's texture stays consistent. Brief register drift into abstract lyricism ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") is pattern-taught and legible, though the metaphor density in the middle third risks slowing the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Mara's perceptual signature favors tactile and archival detail (fingertips grazing indentations, tin box, bronze drawers). Voice modulates appropriately from investigative calm to discovery intensity. Some elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated, and "reclaimed stillness" recurs as a phrase rather than varying its expression. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (she infers but does not claim omniscience). Filter verbs are minimal. Prose as character: syntax reflects her methodical cataloguer mind.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and compressed, with a distinct perceptual signature: the maker notices kerosene, gem-polishing strokes, and the basalt island through craft-trained eyes. POV distance is stable third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("paradox the floating islands demanded of every pilgrim," "luminous torment") that reads authorial rather than character-particular, especially under peak stress. The prose teaches its poetic compression early, but some figurative density ("galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories," "fire she could not bear to hold alone") abstracts rather than specifies the maker's grief. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent poetic-philosophical register. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices fractures, energy signatures, unused math problems—details filtered through his post-trauma obsession. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that strains plausibility for a man with shattered ribs in acute grief ("perturbation theory," "intangibly tangible," "grave robber of possibility"). The bride's reflection reads as authorial interrogation rather than his own contradictory impulse, creating brief psychic distance instability.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara with no head-hopping. The opening carries a distinct lyric texture ("eyes that held galaxies," "brilliant dimness"), and the pilgrim's dialogue is economical and purposeful. However, the prose drifts into elevated register during peak beats—"frequencies hit her like music she'd always known but never heard"—without grounding in Mara's established idiom, and filter verbs ("watched," "saw," "recognized") appear frequently without voice-motivated reason. The perceptual signature is atmospheric but not character-particular; Mara's way of noticing does not shift under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent interiority and perceptual signature (e.g., "sieved hush," "crescents into his palm," "rings know when they're lying"). Diction occasionally elevates ("genealogist of ghosts," "tempered regret") in ways that feel slightly imposed rather than emerged from Elias's mental register under pressure. The mother's single line of dialogue carries subtext and goal but we get only one exchange, limiting full voice distinction test. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment to reflective overview.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael with a consistent lyric-elevated register ("borrowed bone," "furrowed hush where blame thinned to gauze"). The perceptual signature is distinct—moon phases, leviathan imagery, "squid grief"—but the diction occasionally drifts into writerly artifice ("trafficked in futures, not ledgers") that strains against the scene's immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful (Seris's question about contrition, Kael's reply), and the closing narration modulates to a quieter, retrospective cadence that supports the Charged Poise closure. One recurring friction: elevated metaphors appear in nearly every beat, creating density that sometimes slows momentum rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: maritime vocabulary, navigator's lens filtering utility poles as constellations, technical detail (drysuit, aircraft beacon). Diction stays character-consistent through most beats. However, several register shifts break voice: "nature abhors a vacuum so passionately" reads overly literary for crisis navigation, "backlash of regrets" as a term feels clinical, and "merrily melancholic" repeated as descriptor rather than dramatized state. The lover's quoted line "Come back when your charts match your pulse" sounds writerly rather than spoken. Psychic distance and tense remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance appropriate for lyric-philosophical mode. Perceptual signature is present (sensory metaphors, embodied transformation) but diction drifts into elevated abstraction under peak pressure: "delicately robust yearning," "jaded wonder," "consent to fracture." These phrases feel authored rather than focalized through a character whose memories were scrubbed hours prior. Syntax modulates with intensity (short fragments during peak beats, longer cadences in reflection) but the voice reads more as stylized narrator than character-particular mind. No dialogue present to judge naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature (starfruit bruises, cracked porcelain bowl, "little moon" endearment) and consistent first-person present anchors POV. However, register drifts toward elevated lyricism ("caravan of memories," "threshold of myth") in several peak beats, straining the focalizer's plausible lexicon under grief. The merged voice at closure ("two voices in one chest") is handled cleanly with dual plural we. No head-hopping, but the elevated diction in high-pressure moments (inhalation, merger) dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through the cartomancer's grief-saturated perception is consistent (the moonlight "tasted," the cloud "shuddered, remembering"). Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the fairy-tale register, but at peak emotional beats ("The cartomancer's throat filled with choking beauty") the metaphor leans toward stock poeticism rather than character-particular idiom. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (crack as river/canyon/lightning bolt, time as pooling liquid) are taught early and sustained. Psychic distance remains close but declarative, with limited embodied contradiction. No dialogue to evaluate. Distance control is clean but the prose occasionally drifts into narrated summary ("she understood," "she realized") where dramatized perception would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register ("star-pocked silence," "gravitationally lighter when happy"). Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated for the contemplative tone. However, peaks ("shadow work complete," "joy flooded her—not naive, but forged") slip into therapeutic abstraction and authorial assertion. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression and ellipsis are present but the piece does not fully teach the pattern; some transitions feel like connective gaps rather than deliberate elision.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Kael. Diction elevates under pressure ("mosaic of every person he had ever helped, each shard whispering a single word: texture") in ways that strain plausibility for a destitute man mid-crisis. Lira's dialogue ("whether transformation hurt as much as the silence that followed it") reads writerly rather than urgent. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans lyric-generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Garnet with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct baroque texture—"murdered torch bracket," "lovers' exhale," "thin kites snagging on surprise"—that is consistent and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("motif of the hour," "reweights the dominant stake") that sits uncomfortably with the action-driven urgency. Luce's brief whisper and Garnet's response feel functional rather than character-distinct. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "recognized") appear but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the lock-picking and Voss encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register, and the prose carries a distinct texture (e.g., "borrowed dawn," "geometry of absence"). However, psychic distance drifts: the narrator claims certainty about Mira's death as "the last equation in a sequence that began with the first star's collapse," knowledge Elias could not possess. Diction occasionally inflates beyond the focalizer's plausible lexicon during peak beats ("interference patterns in the air itself, visible as shimmering equations written in light"). The precognitive curse allows strategic withholding, but key mechanics (why these rocks, why this sequence) are elided without on-page cost or later friction that pays off the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose sustains a heightened, lyric register with strong perceptual signature ("rain on hot pavement," "needle-cold droplets," "negative space between stars"). POV remains stable in close third, and the compressed diction ("rarefy," "halide," "cumulonimbus") fits the poet-protagonist's lexicon. However, the voice occasionally tips into purple density—"furiously tranquil, a vigil in pause" recurs as a refrain that borders on over-ornamentation. Under peak stress (storm strike, dissolution ritual), the syntax maintains its baroque texture rather than compressing, which dilutes urgency. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent narrative register. Vale's dialogue ("You still sew your arguments?") carries subtext. Minor slips: "diplomatically fierce in his stillness" is writerly rather than perceived, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("syntax," "proposition buried in geometry") that sits awkwardly in a waiting-room scene. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is present in Lark's attention to molting and poetic detail. Dialogue when it appears ("Can poems stop bulldozers?") carries subtext and advances the collaboration. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"jurisdiction-less," "sovereign gap," "lantern-bearer"—that feels imposed rather than voice-specific for a vagrant poet. Filter verbs ("feels," "remembers") cluster in reflective beats but do not severely dull immediacy. The final paragraph's prophetic future tense ("will return," "will stream out") shifts from present-scene focalization without clear signal.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"reluctant pigeons," "brass corpse," "celluloid-thin"—that reflects the pianist's wistful register. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "tidal arbor," "strategically creative fingers," "iron filings around an invisible magnet" read more authorial than character-voiced. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-passage the voice loses specificity under metaphorical load. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains controlled, yet the prose occasionally sacrifices immediacy for ornament, dulling the sense of embodied urgency at the shaft climb and film-entry beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited voice is stable and richly textured: "empirically whimsical hush," "stories dislike being weighed," "the ridge's heartbeat lowered her into darkness that tasted of orchids and iron." Psychic distance modulates purposefully between Calyx's embodied perception and the wider world. One persistent weakness: elevated diction ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical," "monochrome canyon," "Conceptual Repricing") occasionally drifts into essay register, especially in the final two paragraphs where the narrator over-explains the thematic stakes ("cultural memory survives not because it is true…") rather than trusting the image. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (maples as "breathing sculptures," the compass "counting heartbeats the world had forgotten"). Kaede's dialogue is purposefully compressed and voice-distinct ("Memory is a tide"), though brief. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("arabesque," "stanza of silence") that feels imposed rather than character-bound during the ritual beats. The narrative stance modulates appropriately from arrival to instruction to reflection, and the time-jump to "Years later" is clean.

    The close third-person voice is distinctive, fusing scientific register (“magnetic field decay curve of PSR J1748-2446ad”) with lyrical, sensory description (“humidity still clung like a guilty conscience”), and remains consistent throughout. Psychic distance is well controlled; we get both her technical focus and her emotional undercurrents without head-hopping or jarring stance shifts. Diction and syntax feel like a specific mind—precise, metaphor-friendly, but always informed by her astrophysicist identity. A few abstract/philosophical sentences verge on essayistic, but they align with her intellect enough that they don’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in glass, heat, frost, and kiln imagery that feels intrinsic to this character. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, modulating from compressed, image-dense canyon passages to slightly more expansive, reflective beats in the bus and new studio. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. The elevated diction occasionally brushes up against overt thematic phrasing, but overall the voice is controlled, cohesive, and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct sensory palette and metaphoric logic that fits Mara’s acoustic-scientist/artistic mind. POV distance is stable and appropriate; we stay in a close third with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and diction modulate well with intensity, especially as the performance builds and the prose leans into cascading images without losing track of concrete action. It reads like a singular, intentional voice rather than generic elevated prose.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly tuned to this character’s profession and temperament, with recurring mortuary and archival metaphors grounding the surrealism. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with long, baroque sentences creating a hushed, immersive mood that fits the underwater library’s timeless quality. Focalization stays cleanly with the undertaker’s perspective while allowing mythic distance where needed. The diction is elevated but coherent for a fable-like, literary mode and does not break character or world.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close on Mara is stable and confident, with a distinct, quietly lyrical texture (“Dawn bruised the horizon,” “scent rising like unbanned prayer”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with no head-hopping or register glitches; brief access to Lita’s and the boy’s speech reads cleanly as external. The voice modulates well with pressure, keeping the same tonal palette while slightly tightening around key beats (formula in cart, sanctions tightening, dawn ringing). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext about names, covenants, and future roles.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“breath…tasted purple, medicinal”) that feels organically tied to the pilgrim’s sensibility. The single line of dialogue from the man is tonally matched yet distinct, carrying subtext without breaking the spell. Psychic distance is well-managed: even when the prose grows ornate, it remains anchored in her embodied experience rather than abstract commentary. The risk of over-lyricism is mostly controlled, and the pattern is taught early enough that it reads as intentional rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct, poetic lexicon that matches the speculative, metaphysical subject matter. Diction and syntax remain consistent with an observant, design-obsessed protagonist whose thoughts naturally take geometric and filmic shapes.

There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and psychic distance modulates smoothly as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged but controlled, with consistent diction and a strong perceptual signature (“patient as drought-grass,” “dust rolled through the midway”). POV is stable and free of leakage; the occasional elevated metaphor still feels like her sensibility rather than an external commentator. The single line of heightened ringmaster dialogue is tonally appropriate and character-distinct. Minor risk: the narratorial register is so burnished that in a few spots it feels more authorial than strictly character-bound, but it rarely breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s audio-sensory and synesthetic focus (hearing heat as cello, colors as sound). Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences vary in length and musicality without slipping into incoherence or register drift. The narrative does not head-hop, and its occasional omniscient-leaning phrasing still feels like an extension of Mara’s consciousness rather than an intrusive authorial lecture. Under stress, the voice compresses toward more charged, image-heavy moments without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric, metaphor-rich, and plausibly aligned with a contemplative artisan who comforts herself by narrating. The playful high-register faux-epic lines (“Behold, the pilgrim...”) contrast effectively with the more intimate, softened narration toward the end, signaling her emotional shift. POV remains stable with no leakage, and the diction choices feel deliberate rather than generic. A touch more variation in rhythm between lush and plain sentences might sharpen contrast further, but current control is already publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistently colored by stunt and film metaphors (“call for places,” “family brand,” “edited lie surrounding every shot”).

Dialogue is minimal but effective, especially the girl’s line “Only to people who listen scared,” which deepens theme without over-explaining. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, balancing lyric flourish and clarity.

    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistently lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., “latitude of last lullaby, longitude of unopened farewell”). Diction and rhythm are carefully modulated, sustaining a high-poetic register that still tracks the oracle’s worldview and the story’s mythic mode. POV is stable and confident; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Repetition (of hush, stars, mapping) is patterned and purposeful rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person, close-but-formal narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for a newly sentient robot: coolly observant, slightly elevated, with technical touches (“optical sensors,” “neural net”). Rhythm and diction are controlled, and the patterned repetition of phrases (“In the frozen courtyard at twilight…”) works as a deliberate structural motif rather than artifact. That said, the voice sometimes edges into generic SF-philosophical register, with repeated abstractions (“consciousness,” “purpose,” “evolution”) that blur J4N-17’s distinct perceptual signature. A bit more idiosyncrasy in how this specific robot notices and thinks would push the voice into a more memorable zone.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice tied to Mira is consistent and confident, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture (“listening to snow fall upward,” “her voice soft as wet gravel”). Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the shift from lyrical narration to simple spoken lines at the end is effective. The narrative lexicon occasionally skirts the edge of writerly flourish, yet overall remains coherent with the contemplative, nocturnal register. There’s a distinct perceptual signature without POV leakage or mechanical scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with occasional widened awareness (the garden “watched”) that feels integral rather than leaky. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the prose modulates well between quiet ritual and heightened, almost sacred, discovery without losing coherence. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she notices plant behavior, seasons, and small textures like spider silk. It falls short of the absolute top tier only because the voice, while strong, doesn’t quite achieve the startling idiosyncrasy or rhythmic daring of the most memorable literary narrators.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the mechanic’s professional and bodily lens (xenobiology logs, prosthetic lungs, mechanical metaphors). Syntax and rhythm modulate well between hushed atmosphere and moments of conceptual intensity, without losing clarity. The diction (“chrysalis,” “imago,” “lattice of light”) fits both the scientific and quasi-mystical valence of her perspective. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the narrative confidence feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the haunted, waterlogged setting. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and there’s a consistent perceptual filter focused on sound, water, and liminality that feels character-appropriate for a musician. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping; time and stance are stable. The main limitation is occasional abstract phrasing (“space where the unsung could finally be heard”) that leans more toward essayistic statement than textured perception.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses meteorological language with bodily and mystical imagery. Diction like “barograph’s trembling hairline” and “radio static that murmured names of the soon-to-die” feels native to this character rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is stable; we never head-hop or slip into an authorial register that breaks the spell. The only restraint from an even higher score is occasional density where back-to-back metaphors risk slowing moment-to-moment reading.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—industrial-lyric, skeptical yet susceptible—that remains stable and precise. Diction (“drowsy alertness,” “swallowed truth,” “measured, balanced, appraised”) feels both character-appropriate and thematically charged without slipping into alien register. There is no head-hopping; psychic distance is well controlled, tightening when she handles the wheel and opening slightly for patterned description. The single spoken line from Mara aligns with her interior skepticism and functions as action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive, with controlled syntax and a strong perceptual signature built around books, stone, silence, and time. The prose modulates from exploratory to climactic without head-hopping or stance confusion, and the patterned diction (folds, burrowing, drift of seasons) clearly teaches and then fulfills the design. At times the register leans toward ornate, but it remains coherent with the mythic, accumulative mode rather than reading as arbitrary purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and closely tailored to Elara’s perceptions, with controlled shifts in cadence as the eclipse peaks and ebbs. Diction (“filament of sound,” “interval between heartbeats”) is elevated but coherent with the mythic-ritual frame and never slips into expository flatness. The narrative stance balances interior access and panoramic glimpses of the valley children without head-hopping confusion. Overall, the voice feels distinct and polished enough for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the historian’s sensibility—attuned to textures, metals, and quiet. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, more incantatory lines around the diaries and ritual and tighter beats at structural pivots (“She descended to the ground floor and chose the smoothest stretch of bare concrete”). Diction is elevated but coherent with the world and focalizer; there is no register drift or POV leakage. The pattern of metaphor and repetition (“bronze quiet,” “axis,” “doors”) is taught early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward light, instruments, and coded communication that fits Chen’s mind and trade. Dialogue is economical and natural, carrying subtext (the keeper’s casual questions vs. Chen’s layered answers) without over-explanation. There is some mild omniscient drift (into fishermen’s future reactions) but it reads as a controlled, storyteller stance rather than head-hopping. The rhythmic control is strong overall, though the high-poetic register is uniform enough that it slightly flattens distinctions in mood and psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The omniscient lyric voice is highly controlled, with a distinctive texture of metaphoric and conceptual noticing that stays consistent throughout. Phrases like “a rosary of clicks” and “a Möbius strip of intent without object” show a clear perceptual signature and confident rhythm. There is no head-hopping; despite the occasional access to multiple congregants’ experiences, the stance feels like one unified, authorial intelligence. The density of figurative language is high, but it reads as deliberate stylistic choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and highly particular in diction (“chronologically homesick,” “upturned hush,” “postal system of prophetic loops”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the memory-etching sequences and the shift into named musical movements, without losing clarity. The perceptual signature—someone who thinks in scores, shells, and temporal metaphors—remains distinct throughout. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the voice’s intensity is almost unwavering, leaving little dynamic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, confident texture—“Archive of Unfinished Hours,” “periodically eternal,” “labyrinth had grown teeth”—and maintains a coherent psychic distance throughout. Diction and rhythm are tightly controlled, with patterned phrasing taught early and sustained, and no head-hopping or stance confusion. Lyric compression in high-pressure moments (two-heartbeat windows, collapsing timelines) feels intentional rather than evasive. A tiny push more toward modulating sentence texture at the climax could move it into truly extraordinary territory.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and well-adapted to a deaf protagonist, foregrounding touch and vibration over hearing without breaking plausibility. Diction and syntax have a distinct music—“cedar and goatskin,” “tone-arm lifted like a broken wing,” “each flake landing with a hush she could almost hear”—that feels like this character’s way of experiencing the world. Psychic distance is controlled, flexing closer at peak beats (her tears, the memory of her sister’s laugh) without slipping into authorial explanation. There is no head-hopping; even references to Temen’s perceptions are grounded in visible action rather than interior access.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tight third-person voice is lyrically controlled and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a storm recorder, with metaphors tied to weather, pressure, and systems. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate without becoming opaque, and psychic distance remains stable and apt for the piece’s contemplative but tense mode. There’s no dialogue to test, but interiority and narrative stance feel unified and confident. The voice is distinctive and memorable, just shy of exceptional because it occasionally leans toward polished general-literary lyricism rather than something unmistakably idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is highly controlled and distinct, with a consistent lexicon that marries technical precision (“esters,” “genome,” “ventilation ducts”) to lyrical metaphor. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, baroque sentences for contemplation and tighter ones on key emotional turns (“He had come to grieve, aromatically cautious…”). The perceptual signature—thinking in scent, light, and trade metaphors—feels inseparable from Elian’s mind. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helper” voice undermining the intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinct and coherent, blending roadside roughness with lyric perception in a way that feels true to a “drifting roadside poet.” Diction and imagery (“air shimmer like heat above summer asphalt,” “the memory of perfume in an empty room”) are controlled and character-specific rather than generic. Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or implausible omniscience. The voice sustains its texture under pressure, especially in the closing road-walking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited voice is strong, stable, and distinctly tuned to an acoustically obsessed musician; perceptions are consistently filtered through sound and resonance metaphors. Syntax and rhythm vary with pressure, leaning lush but controlled, and never tipping into confusion; the accumulative lyric mode is taught from the first paragraph and held. Diction fits both the quasi-mythic tone and Mara’s sensibility, avoiding register clashes or explanatory intrusion. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative voice alone carries subtext about grief, tradition, and invitation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyric, sensory, and keyed to someone who lives by manipulating feelings via scent. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with cadences that flex between aphoristic insight and embodied perception without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional and subtextual, revealing status and aims without over-explaining. A few lines verge on crafted aphorism, but the overall perceptual signature stays coherent and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct maritime-commercial lexicon (“demurrage,” “manifest,” “broker authority”) braided into poetic images. POV remains stably close-third on Marisol while allowing light, controlled omniscient touches that fit the fable-like tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-specific, especially Beto’s understated lines and the intern’s practical admission. Rhythmic control is strong, with varied sentence lengths and few if any missteps in register.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (reeds, glass, breath, sound) that feels specific to Lira’s sensibility. Syntax and rhythm vary in step with emotional intensity, and elevated diction matches the mythic-fantastical register without jarring modern intrusions. Brief dialogue from the twins is sparse but distinct in its braided cadence and goal-directed content. Occasional authorial-abstract phrases (“luminescent ache,” “beyond the murmur of lost languages”) integrate smoothly into the established tone rather than reading as register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm that fits both Mira’s artistic eye and the fantastical city. Patterned phrases around time and echo (“liquid lace,” “doorway of sound,” “womb of resonance”) are purposeful and reinforce the conceptual frame rather than feeling generic. Psychic distance is well managed; we stay near Mira’s perceptions without sliding into authorial explanation. There are no POV slips or register mismatches that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinctive, and consistent, with a mathematician-conjurer’s lexicon (“vectors of longing,” “cavern’s algebra,” “integral sign cradling a heart”). Rhythm varies well between longer lyric sentences and shorter, weighted beats, especially around key actions like the drop striking the eye. The controlled use of abstraction matches the narrator’s character and doesn’t drift into generic poeticism. There is no dialogue to test, but the internal narrating stance is stable and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a close third on Elias—rich but controlled syntactically, with strong rhythmic modulation. Diction and imagery (“sapphire hush,” “breadcrumb of human breath”) create a distinct texture without slipping into abstraction. Access to the girl’s inner life is inferential rather than direct, but that choice supports Elias-centered focalization and the theme of partial visibility. Overall, the prose “sounds like itself” in a way that would be immediately recognizable on a magazine page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and sensorially precise, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in botanical and environmental metaphors. Rhythm modulates nicely from longer, lush sentences in atmospheric beats to tighter phrasing during the peak bodily transformation (“Her fingers lengthened, becoming translucent green near the tips…”). The later omniscient-leaning summary of the nursery’s future is a deliberate but noticeable widening of distance; it works thematically but slightly erodes the intense subjective texture established earlier. Overall, the voice feels confident and distinctive without major slips in register.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Mara’s sensibility as a weary, observant painter; diction and metaphor choice feel like hers. The old woman’s brief dialogue has a compatible yet distinct cadence, with the late echo of “wryly earnest” reading as intentional mirroring rather than flattening. POV control is steady with no leakage or unexplained knowledge. At times, abstractions like “unearthed convergence” verge on essayistic, but they remain grounded enough in image to preserve voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinctive lyric texture—“bright darkness,” “corridors branching like frozen lightning,” “grammar of possibility”—that remains controlled and consistent throughout. The narrative stance is stable, with occasional gentle omniscient flourishes that suit the mythic tone and do not muddle focalization. Rhythms vary well between longer, cascading sentences and tighter clauses, giving the prose musicality that matches the setting. A few abstractions (“concept,” “possibility,” “overlapping shadows” as explanation) approach rhapsodic over-explanation, but they generally stay anchored enough in image to avoid blur.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically patterned, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that filters everything through archival and textual metaphors. Diction and syntax feel unified with the narrator’s sensibility; phrases like “every mast a sentence snapped in half” and “sentences whose verbs were exiled” weld occupation and psyche. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext and pressure without breaking the established register. The voice sustains its lyricism under increasing emotional weight without slipping into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture that matches Alden’s “analytically artistic” mind, with patterned diction around mapping, tickets, and cracks. POV is stable and modest—no unjustified access to other minds or world-knowledge—and the narrative stance feels like heightened free indirect rather than detached commentary. Rhythmic variation is good, with long sinuous sentences offset by shorter, emphatic lines at key beats (“Alden lifted it; the metal was warm…”). The high-poetic register is sustained, though at times it risks smoothing over the rawness of his inner turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its musical metaphors and attention to pattern (“migration routes of human attention”). Diction is elevated but suits Mara’s temperament and the quasi-mystical scientific setting, and the narrative distance stays stable even as it leans into poetic omniscient turns. Rhythm varies well—long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere, tighter ones at points of impact (“Mara staggered back, knocking over the telescope”). There is no dialogue to test differentiation, but the narrative voice alone is strong enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinct, with controlled lyricism (“Möbius sigh,” “iron boredom in his blood”) that matches Vey’s immortal perspective and modulates gracefully as pressure builds. Diction and rhythm feel intentional, with almost no register slips or explanatory overreach; exposition is folded into sensory and conceptual texture. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, carrying subtext and thematic weight, particularly in the question “What happens after goodbye?”. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, marrying sensory vividness with Cassidy’s cool, calculating mindset. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with images like “dawn was a bruise over the city” and “granite policies into negotiable vapor” giving the prose distinct texture without losing clarity. Dialogue is efficient, status-aware, and subtextual—Rurik’s “granite” line and Cassidy’s “holding a detonator” courtesy both signal power play. There are no POV slips or expository intrusions undermining the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is highly controlled, lyrically dense, and consistently filtered through Aurelia’s sensibility as a stationer obsessed with texture, light, and falsified documents. Images like “footprints recording minutes the way a sunday records hymns” and the lamp humming “C-sharp” show a distinct perceptual signature rather than generic poeticism. Psychic distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinct—lushly metaphorical yet coherently tied to Mara’s sensory and conceptual focus on metal, tides, and paperwork. Diction and syntax stay consistent, with purposeful lyric compression (“some aisles glowed with sodium light, others drowned in salt shadow”) that teaches its pattern early. There’s no head-hopping; even world-level statements feel filtered through Mara’s lived experience of bureaucratic nonexistence. A few elevated abstractions clip the edge of her implied register but don’t materially disrupt the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel aligned to Arlen’s sensibility as a myth-busting empiricist in a decaying scientific temple (“boot crunching on glass that once measured starlight”). Diction and rhythm modulate well with pressure, tightening around key beats like the cracking shell or the reweighted TV quote. Limited dialogue is natural and charged, especially the mother’s line reframed through music. There’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts; the slight authorial elevation feels purposeful and in character for someone steeped in myths and science.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, mixing wry observational metaphors (“games were rigged by uncertainty”; “laughter…like a countdown”) with Lina’s grounded, practical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive and tightly controlled, with a strong cartographic/linguistic perceptual filter (“walls ribbed like throat cartilage,” “subterranean arteries”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between contemplative description and compressed action; the prose feels intentionally patterned rather than generic. The narrative only knows what Maren can infer, and the occasional higher-register phrasing matches her educated, observant character. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the lyrical compression remains intelligible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)

Patterned phrases (e.g., hush, resonance, lilac) are intentional leitmotifs rather than artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, idiosyncratic lyricism—phrases like “chasing hush the way men chase fog” and “the floor forget gravity” feel both stylistically unified and character-colored. POV remains stable and modest in its knowledge, allowing the strangeness of the lighthouse to emerge through Cassian’s perceptions rather than authorial explanation. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the father’s rusted, minimal lines contrasting Cassian’s more articulated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled, with a coherent third-person lens that hews close to the ghost bride’s perceptions while allowing cool, precise phrasing. Diction (“iron air,” “furnace wind,” “atoms of ash becoming moths”) is distinctive without feeling mannered, and syntax varies in length to match contemplative vs. climactic moments. Brief dialogue is natural for the world and age-appropriate for the boy, and her archaic, bell-like utterance suits her nature.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and richly textured, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses Calyx’s sensibility with the narrator’s mythic register. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the dense imagery from feeling mechanical, and the narrative distance stays stable.

Some editors might wish for an occasional plainer sentence to punch through the lushness, but as an aesthetic choice the voice feels fully committed and well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a consistent perceptual signature—sensual, spiritually attentive, preoccupied with bones, roots, and time. Diction like “cautious enchantment thick as honey” fits the world and the protagonist’s stance without drifting into an alien register. Dialogue is sparse but pointed; the caretaker’s “rebuild or rob?” line crystallizes stakes efficiently and in a distinct idiom from the narration. The lyric compression and long sentences are well handled, though a demanding venue might want one or two more variations in rhythm at peak beats for optimal modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through her sensibility, with a strong rhythmic control that suits the reflective, high-pressure moment. Diction and imagery (“neon signs from the 2080s flickered like tired fireflies”) feel specific to this narrator’s way of seeing and remain stable throughout. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping; psychic distance is well managed. A few repeated phrasings (“carefully inventive,” full phrase “codes in children’s sidewalk chalk”) are noticeable but not seriously damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in textile, astronomy, and pattern language. Recurrent phrases (“flame from eternal candle,” “adjacent possibilities,” “echoed silence”) function as deliberate, patterned diction rather than artifact and are varied enough in use to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent with an introspective translator used to moving between languages and metaphors. Diction (“shelling,” “palimpsest,” “Charged Poise” equivalents) feels earned for this character and setting, and the rhythm modulates nicely between long, sinuous sentences and sharper beats. Dialogue is sparse but charged; the boy’s few lines are age-believable yet resonant, and the narrator’s response (“I unknot by naming”) lands as both character and theme. There’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition—compression and elision read as deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly textured: a lush, cinematic lyricism that matches a muralist who “paints with light.” Third-person focalization never leaks; interior access and descriptive choices clearly belong to Luma’s sensibility.

The voice is stylized but controlled, with no confusing slippage in stance or register.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“lyrics were all verbs without endings,” “coloring-book ghosts”) that fits Liora’s perceptual world. POV control is clean—third-person close with a steady distance that allows both tactile detail and conceptual play. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, and the guide’s final line carries subtext and thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, witty, and controlled, with metaphors (“orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors,” “moonlight taxed itself for the privilege of existing”) that feel rooted in Arlo’s scholarly, tax-haunted mind. POV is stable, with no head-hopping and a consistent register that plausibly matches a “rogue scholar.” Dialogue is sparse but effective, particularly Voss’s “candidly cryptic” line, which carries subtext and tension.

Psychic distance is well controlled for a lyric mode, slipping closer at key beats (touching the dew, reading the postscript) without losing coherence. Patterned diction (spirals, blossoms, shells, off-key wind) is taught early and repurposed at closure, giving the prose an intentional rhythmic weave. There’s no head-hopping or register clash; the density feels deliberate and character-inflected rather than generic purple.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and closely aligned with Lira’s sensibility, with metaphors and diction (“foxglove regret,” “opal library”) forming a coherent perceptual signature.

The rhythmic control is strong, especially in the opening and closing cadences. A few lines flirt with over-ornateness, but they remain legible and character-appropriate rather than feeling like generic “poetic” prose.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature—technical detail (surveyors’ chain, adhesive lattice) intertwined with sensuous, almost mystical description (“building breathed,” “dappled resolve”). Third-person focus on Mireya remains stable, with no head-hopping or register slips; the occasional elevated diction feels appropriate to her vocation and the story’s mythic tone. Rhythm varies well between long, textured sentences and tighter ones at key turns. The voice sustains its intensity without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice is close, lyrical, and remarkably consistent in diction and rhythm, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., dust as arpeggios, pigeons as correspondents). Syntax and metaphor density feel intentional and character-inflected rather than generic “poetic” overlay. Brief dialogue lines are spare and in keeping with the atmosphere, and the slight pullback at the very end into a broader vantage is controlled and legible. A small glitch (“learning to trust again across learning to trust again”) momentarily jars but does not materially damage the POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-close voice is consistent and distinct, with a calm, precise lyricism (“pages soft as moth wings,” “read necessary distances in the way wood remembered storms”). Diction and syntax match Juniper’s contemplative, craft-attuned perception, and the narrative distance remains steady throughout. The rhythmic control across long, layered sentences is generally excellent and supports the accumulative pressure. At times the register approaches grand abstraction (“grain of our own becoming”), but it still fits the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—scientific lexicon braided with mythic and ceremonial imagery—that feels coherent with a “landscape astrologer” mind. POV remains stable and modest in its claims, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well: longer, image-rich lines under wonder, slightly tighter phrasing around key actions, though the piece remains generally lush. The voice’s specificity and consistency under pressure would meet the bar for many high-end venues.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident, consistent, and character-colored; diction like “cheerful gloom” and “sea-foam recollectionist” feels unified rather than grab-bag. Imagery and syntax modulate well with beats—the cadence softens at closure, the middle densifies as discoveries accrue—without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrator’s certainty tracks what Lira can observe or infer within this stylized world. It’s a distinctive, controlled voice suitable for high-end venues.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and specific, with metaphors (“gulls trace invisible thermals,” “calculated wilderness of chords”) that feel organic to Cipher’s analytical yet romantic mindset. POV remains stable and confident, allowing brief omniscient-ish touches (e.g., describing the crowd) that still feel filtered through his conceptual frame of “ordering randomness.” Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, flexing from dense description to cleaner causal beats at moments of action. The diction is elevated but coherent with the piece’s ambitions and never drifts into jarring register shifts or explanatory hand-holding.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and clearly filtered through Lysira’s sensibility (tide metaphors, bodily awareness, dance language). Syntax and rhythm modulate well—from longer, incantatory sentences when she invokes gaps, to tighter beats at key turns—without ever losing clarity. The elevated diction fits the mythic, speculative register and feels intrinsic rather than imposed. There is no dialogue, but internal narration carries subtext and mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in the way Mara notices light, glass, and small damages. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the imagery tends to be precise and grounded (“storms slid off them like apologies,” “engines cannot reach”). Occasional contemporary phrases (“She understood the assignment”) momentarily jar against the otherwise timeless, mythic register, but they don’t break coherence. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and controlled enough to support publication in a high-end venue.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet steady, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses Elias’s firefighter past with his current ritual. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, modulating between long, image-rich sentences and shorter, declarative pivots at emotional beats (“But embers eventually speak.”). Diction like “translate pain into a universal language” sits on the upper edge of plausibility but reads as earned introspection rather than authorial intrusion. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice sustains its texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-focus lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct texture—scientific diction braided with dreamlike imagery (“dawn before language,” “jet stream of collective thought”). Rhythms modulate well between longer, sinuous sentences and tighter closures at key beats (the gauge clicking, the balloon bursting, the final walk into the tide). POV is stable and filtered consistently through Mira’s logical-yet-dreaming sensibility. A few formulations skate toward overt statement, but they do not fracture the voice or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent perceptual signature centered on sound, architecture, and image inversion. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and the slide to a slightly more omniscient, reportorial tone in the rescue-team coda feels like an intentional zoom-out rather than leakage. Diction remains coherent with the story’s speculative-literary register, avoiding distracting register jumps. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable in a competitive venue.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is distinct, confidently lyrical, and consistent in its metaphoric palette (“taller than grief,” “living chandeliers,” “song sharp enough to cut glass into grace”). Third-person close POV holds steady and does not overreach knowledge beyond the painter’s perceptual frame. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the heightened diction feels congruent with the fable-like, surreal world. At times the lyricism approaches saturation, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, comfortably inhabiting a mythic register that matches the subject matter. Phrasing like “operatively gentle” and “gardener of memory” gives the narration a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility for a high-fantasy frame. Rhythmic variation and sentence length are generally well controlled, modulating nicely around key beats such as the name-recitation and the casting of the clipboard. At times, the voice leans on familiar solemn formulations, but not enough to erode its distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in this man’s blend of technocratic power and bruised nostalgia (e.g., “laundering the cruelty through scholarships and hospital wings”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long, sinuous sentences in reflective beats; sharper, more charged lines around the egg’s fracture and the swallowing. Diction choices (“manufactured drought,” “secret sentimental plaque,” “grace refracted through a fractured conscience”) feel unified rather than showy, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift. The narrator’s limited omniscience is stable and believable for this slightly elevated, literary stance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive and consistent, with a confident, lyric diction that fits the fantastical, ritualized setting. Phrases like “every obligation is a knot waiting for fingernails” and “darkness polished to a mirror” show a strong perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Psychic distance stays stable; we are anchored in Lys’s perceptions even as the narration remains slightly elevated. The high-register, metaphor-dense style occasionally risks over-saturation but rarely tips into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third‑person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fits an urbane calligrapher given to metaphor and reflection. Syntax and diction are controlled, and the magical elements are folded into the narrative stance without jarring shifts. The free‑indirect feel stays stable; there’s no head‑hopping, and the quasi‑omniscient flourishes align with the piece’s fable‑like tone. Occasionally the abstract register (“ethical storytelling,” “manifesto”) intrudes a bit, slightly flattening the otherwise vivid voice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, mixing sensory concreteness with esoteric, slightly formal diction that fits the character and world. Syntax and rhythm are well controlled, with long, flowing sentences in contemplative moments and tighter pulses around key beats (“The last monarch… circled her head three times…”). There’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience beyond what can be read as lyricized interior perception. The single spoken line and grandmother’s remembered maxim integrate smoothly without disrupting narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with controlled, elevated diction that fits a reflective artisan steeped in ritual and craft. Lexical and rhythmic patterns (“technically gentle,” the layered metaphors) are consistent and feel like a single mind, not an impersonal narrator. Psychic distance is well managed, allowing both close affect and broader conceptual framing without head-hopping or stance drift. At times the lushness verges on over-rich, but it rarely undercuts clarity or character plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, confident, and consistent in its lyric density and “precisely playful” phrasing, with a clear perceptual signature (directives, architectures, and weather all treated as sentient systems). POV handling is stable and appropriate; the narrative distance stays close enough to her sensorium while allowing mythic inflection. Rhythm and diction are well-controlled—sentences vary in length and often land on charged images or conceptual turns. The only minor drawback is that the elevated, metaphor-rich register is so uniform it occasionally flattens emotional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon that marries scientific and sacred registers (“equations in cuneiform,” “translated devotion into dimension”). Rhythms vary and are well controlled, supporting the accumulating, reverent tone. The occasional authorial aside (“as if empirically ironic…”) fits the established narrative stance rather than breaking POV. There is no dialogue, but interior access and narrative distance are handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly surreal register that matches the shifting reality and Lira’s liminal work. Syntax and diction choices (“cellular memory,” “spirit skin,” “shifting grace”) feel of a piece rather than stitched from disparate registers. Psychic distance stays stable: we ride Lira’s perceptions and interpretations without head-hopping, and even conceptual claims read as her cognitive frame. The voice could risk overstatement in lesser hands, but here it maintains clarity and emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close, lyric voice is stable and distinctive, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in craft, breath, and luminous materiality. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences matching the ritualistic tone without collapsing into murk. The diction fits the mythic-fabulist mode and does not drift into alien register; no head-hopping or stance confusion appears. It stops short of absolute top-tier only because the voice is tonally narrow—always at a high, incantatory pitch—with limited modulation for moments of sharper fear or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, confident texture—densely metaphorical yet controlled, with coinages like “deciduous vows” and “accidental wisdom” that feel native to this character’s worldview. Psychic distance stays steady, giving us close access filtered through the mender’s craft and history without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between lush descriptive sweeps and tighter action beats (opening the pouch, knotting the ribbon, barring the elders). Occasionally the lyrical register flirts with over-saturation, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads intentional rather than uncontrolled.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lush, and consistent, with a distinct blend of scientific lexicon and mythic lyricism that suits an astral curator. Diction and syntax maintain a stable psychic distance while flexing rhythmically at key moments (e.g., the rapid tightening around page-erasure vs the more expansive descriptive openings). Patterned phrasing (“brightened disquiet,” “simply complicated truth”) feels like an intentional leitmotif rather than artifact. Overall, the perceptual signature is memorable and controlled, even if sometimes more essayistic than embodied under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is strong, consistent, and lyric without losing legibility, with a clear perceptual signature in how language, books, and music are noticed. Experimental conceits (sentences as physical structures, definitions as stairs) are taught early and sustained, so the reader can follow without explanatory asides. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, especially Elara’s line about cutting the sentence and “renegotiation,” which matches the story’s conceptual register. Rhythmic control is high; sentence patterns vary and modulate with scene intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident, consistent, and highly distinctive, with strong rhythm and inventive but coherent imagery (“lions of light pacing behind bars of forgotten laughter”). Psychic distance stays steady: intimate enough to carry her perceptions yet not collapsing into expository explanation. Patterned diction (threads, names, gardens, fog as pages) is taught early and repaid at the end. Despite density, the voice remains legible and aligned with the story’s dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphors (“jaw of chronology,” “book shutting on someone else’s dream”) that feel tied to an archivist’s mind. POV distance stays stable in a close third that never leaks into others’ interiority, and the slight omniscient gloss on the janitor’s diary and campus legend reads like institutional lore Elara would plausibly know. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from becoming sing-song despite its density of figurative language. Occasionally the voice veers toward over-polish, smoothing away rawness that could sharpen individual moments, but it never loses control.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and well-matched to the mythic, acoustic world: diction like “hammered repose,” “petrified song,” and “fossilized chords” builds a distinct sonic texture. POV stays firmly with the mapkeeper’s perceptions and priorities, with no head-hopping, and the few dialogue lines sound natural within this heightened register while advancing stakes. Rhythm modulates appropriately, lingering on augury and stonework, tightening slightly in the dome confrontation. At times the narratorial texture edges toward uniformly ornate, but it remains controlled enough not to blur perspective or intent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a strong lyric texture that matches the character’s sensibility and the world’s strangeness. Diction and imagery (“thistle-blown hope,” “seeds of silence”) feel of a piece rather than grabbed from a thesaurus, and the rhythm modulates well between quieter reflection and charged moments like retrieving the hush shard. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty remains plausibly tied to her perceptions and retrocognitive gift. The voice carries much of the story’s originality without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, with a controlled, poetic lexicon that aligns with an archivist steeped in metaphor and abstraction. Diction and syntax maintain a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the fabulist premise, and the patterned imagery (archives, weather, cartography) feels like her mind’s native idiom. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay close enough to her perceptions while allowing a slightly mythic framing that never slips into head-hopping or authorial lecture. At peaks, the prose intensifies rhythmically without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, confidently close to Luma while retaining a mythic, lyrical register that suits the fable-like fantasy. Syntax and diction are controlled and musical, with strong rhythm and patterning that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Dialogue is sparse but distinct in function—Jax’s quiet subversion, the governor’s brittle rationalizations, Luma’s playful challenge—and it advances stakes rather than expositing. The perceptual signature (e.g., “satchel of star-shells clinking like distant thunder,” “air itself felt corked”) is consistent and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly rooted in the chronicler’s sensibility: metaphors emerge from marine life, geology, and her professional observational stance. Psychic distance is well managed, with occasional slight widenings (“memory-forward”) that still feel compatible with her intellect and grief. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the daughter’s “I thought time would feel sharp…” cleanly echoing and complicating her mother’s conceptual frame. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence length modulating to suit quieter and more charged beats.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is highly controlled, with a strong lyrical texture that clearly belongs to Lira’s perception—gravity, air, and quiet are all felt through her body and history. Diction remains internally coherent (“gilded hush,” “intangibly tangible,” “bolt-sigh”) and patterns of metaphor are taught early and sustained. Psychic distance stays tight, and the narrative doesn’t leak knowledge beyond what she can plausibly infer in this surreal world. The lushness is just shy of over-saturation in places, but rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep it from bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Nilo yet overtly lyrical, with a strong, distinctive texture (“wind, previously a hushed seamstress, now slipped needles through the lattice walls”). Diction, rhythm, and metaphor are controlled and patterned rather than random, teaching the reader early how ornate the narration will be. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, and the commuter’s single, plainspoken line contrasts effectively with the heightened narration. There’s a mild distance from raw interiority because of the elevated register, but it feels like a deliberate stylistic stance, not an accident.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature that blends the technical and the mystical (“plasma torch,” “quantum key,” “pocket of spacetime”). Diction and rhythm largely suit both the character and the hybrid world, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing shifts. The brief label “futuristic nostalgia” is a bit on-the-nose but otherwise the voice shows rather than tells its tonal aim. This is a strong, confident narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (body-as-threshold, pain-as-ritual, suffocation metaphors) that feels native to this character. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, carrying subtext (“You’re teaching me to suffocate so I can breathe?”) and avoiding stiffness. Psychic distance is steady, and the narration doesn’t leak into authorial exposition. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical despite its high figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confidently singular: corporate and quantum registers spliced with deadpan humor (“dimension of perpetual webinars,” “reset the multiversal interest rate”) in a way that tracks with Lira’s history and current milieu. POV is stable and close, with figurative language clearly filtered through her perception; there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. Rhythmic variation between dense, baroque sentences and short, snapping lines at key beats (“squeeze harder.” “Light returned, but gentler…”) supports emotional modulation. A couple of jokier phrases flirt with undercutting tension but overall they enrich the tonal strangeness rather than cheapening it.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (sepia, golden shadows, sound as physical vibration). Syntax varies well, and the narrative distance stays stable, blending limited interiority with rich external observation. Phrases like “eloquently silent” and “golden shadows” recur as motifs rather than tics, largely supporting tone, though they verge on self-consciousness. The very slight abstraction in some lines doesn’t undermine the otherwise confident, character-inflected narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong, recognizable texture of diction and imagery that matches the surreal setting and the knight’s inwardness. Psychic distance is stable, and the telepathic puppet speech feels of a piece with the established narrative mode. Rhythm varies effectively; long baroque sentences are balanced by shorter, weight-bearing lines at key turns. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell, though the sustained high lyricism leaves little room for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly Rowan’s: her metaphoric frames (dust as wind-script, kindness as compass) feel like one mind’s habitual way of seeing. Diction and rhythm show control, with long, sinuous sentences balancing tighter declaratives at key turns (“The system asked for provenance; she typed ‘Unknown, but breathing.’”). There’s no head-hopping, and the brief remembered dialogue is spare and tonally aligned. At rare moments the register brushes the essayistic, but not enough to break the unified perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close-third voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (technology filtered through metaphor, memory, and street-artist sensibility). Syntax and rhythm modulate well with pressure—from contemplative lagoon descriptions to tighter, more action-driven beats during the sprint and rewiring. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the slightly elevated diction feels plausible for Mira’s interior mind even if her spoken dialogue is absent. The voice is memorable and confident without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrically charged, and clearly focalized through the saxophonist’s sensibility; details like intervals “tasting of copper and rust” read as his way of noticing. Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, with longer, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter ones at key pressure points (“Not yet, not yet”). The quasi-omniscient glimpses into other people’s futures work as part of the story’s magical logic rather than head-hopping. At times the diction verges on uniformly elevated, but it still feels like a coherent narrative stance rather than an imposed poetic filter.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with patterned phrasing (“emerges transformed always,” “during the hush”) that the story teaches and then reuses meaningfully. Diction and rhythm feel intentional and well-controlled, matching the mythic, folkloric register without sliding into academic or clinical language. Psychic distance is steady—close enough to reflect Mireya’s perceptions while maintaining a slight storyteller remove that fits the folklore frame. No POV leakage or stance confusion appears, and the narrative modulation at the ending retains clarity despite heightened lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in a clockmaker’s sensibility and a slightly whimsical, melancholic omniscience. Syntax and rhythm are varied and deliberate, supporting both wonder (the cellar waterfall, spinning compass) and quieter resignation (later visits to the ivy-covered hatch). Occasional zoom-outs to sailors’ lore and citywide clock behavior broaden the POV but remain coherent with the established stance, reading as controlled omniscience rather than leakage. Dialogue is sparse but effective, and Elias’s tavern speech sounds like a human extension of the narration instead of expository intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends technical alchemical diction with lyric, grief-inflected observation (“factually-mystical,” “charcoal heart”). Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay inside Aurelia’s sensibility even when the prose grows more abstract, and there’s no POV leakage. Patterned phrases like the numbered limits and recurring weights/starlight motifs feel like intentional structural devices rather than tics. The voice’s elevated register always feels grounded in who Aurelia is, not in generic poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elara’s sensibility; metaphors emerge from the story’s logic (throat of stone, spectral confessions, music that “tastes” like lullabies). Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences balanced by cleaner declarative lines at key turns, and there’s no POV slippage. The diction is elevated but not incongruent with the mythic frame, and moments like “modestly fearless silence she carried like a second skeleton” show a distinct perceptual signature. It edges toward lushness but remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is sharply controlled: clinical yet hallucinatory, with consistent diction that fuses scientific and religious registers (“millijoules,” “communion,” “asymptote”). The perceptual signature is distinct—an awareness obsessed with joints, straps, coefficients, ledgers—and remains stable under stress. Temporal and psychic distance are well handled for a lyric piece; we stay inside the altered consciousness without head-hopping or explanatory intrusions. A handful of similarly structured, image-dense sentences cluster in the middle, creating a faint rhythmic sameness that slightly blunts peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and well-suited to a liminal translator—lyrical without losing clarity, with recurring diction that feels like a personal idiom rather than generic “poetic” language. Psychic distance is stable: we stay inside this consciousness, and the modulation from wonder to vertigo to bittersweet release tracks cleanly. Patterned phrases (“elusively tangible,” “copper and salt,” “between childhood and now”) read as deliberate leitmotifs rather than tics. The brief dialogue lines are spare but tuned to the established tone and advance the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close-third voice is distinctive—technical yet lyrical, with horological and elevator metaphors integrated into perception. POV is stable and plausibly limited to Mara’s knowledge while still accommodating the ghostly surrealism. Rhythm and syntax vary intentionally, often matching pressure spikes (the dust avalanche, the loop revelation). A few lines sound a touch more like an essayistic narrator than Mara under stress, keeping this just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyric, with a consistent, character-inflected lexicon (“letterpress that grew like a steel orchid,” “heart was a cracked chase”) that feels suited to Corwin’s craft and world. POV is stable and distance well-controlled; we stay in his perceptual field even when the narration tilts toward the allegorical. Syntax varies rhythmically and modulates effectively as rupture intensifies. The voice is distinctive enough for high-tier venues, though an occasional image edges toward self-conscious cleverness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-focus voice on Aurelia is consistent and textured, with a strong lyric-science-fiction idiom that feels specific to her sensibility. Later, the camera pulls back slightly to encompass the archaeologist and orbiting ships, but the stance shift is controlled and legible, reading as an intentional widening rather than head-hopping. Diction (“burnished sorrow,” “lattices of the newborn crystal,” “ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood”) is elevated yet coherent with the established imaginative register. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well with pressure; exposition is folded into image and action rather than explanatory aside.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct “tinkersong” texture in its metaphors and sound-focused diction. POV stays essentially with Elias while allowing a light, controlled omniscient widening at the end without confusion. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense description and brisker summary, matching emotional intensity. The prose feels like a singular vision rather than generic fantasy register.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is distinctive—lyric but controlled, with metaphors that are both character-appropriate and thematically relevant (“silence thick as felt,” “pocketed them as vapour”). Diction and syntax stay coherent throughout, modulating subtly with pressure without slipping into a different register. Patterned phrases like “hinged awakenings” and “place where explanations fail” are repeated just enough to feel structural rather than mannered. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the voice’s confidence matches the surreal material it carries.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its storm/wood/light lexicon and syntactic rhythms. Diction is elevated but plausible for this mythic-tinged mode, and metaphoric density is controlled enough that events remain legible under pressure. Recurring phrases (turbine-hum, timewoven, ledger, spirals) form a recognizable music without lapsing into mechanical pattern. POV remains stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps—allowing the accumulative texture to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, distinctive, and deeply fused with Liora’s sensibility—attention is always angled through an artist’s eye without announcing itself. Rhythm and diction are controlled; sentences vary in length and cadence in a way that supports the meditative, accumulative mode. The voice modulates subtly as seasons shift, with winter’s passages feeling heavier and more hushed, and the final sections slightly more expansive and declarative. The only small limit is that, at peak thematic moments, the voice edges toward essayistic clarity, which slightly undercuts the otherwise seamless imagistic register.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (professional precision mixed with baroque imagery). POV remains stable and plausible; world terms (Biblioteca Volante, Repression) are introduced without breaking immersion. Rhythm modulates well from descriptive to climactic beats, and the “searing reverie” tone is embodied by the syntax. A slight risk is that the elevated diction is almost unrelenting, which, for some readers, may blur fine emotional gradations.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with a solitary alchemist-philosopher—rich in metaphor but grounded in craft and civic detail. Diction and syntax feel controlled and patterned rather than randomly ornate, with recurring conceptual frames (retorts, recipes, working memory) anchoring abstraction. The few spoken lines to the bottle are clean and serve as extensions of interior conflict, not exposition dumps. There’s no POV slippage or register drift; the perceptual signature stays sharp throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent with Ambrose’s erudite, archaic sensibility; dead languages, historical kings, and horticultural detail all feel natural in his interior diction. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, using long, sinuous sentences for lush description and tighter lines at key turns (“A prophecy, then, but accidental…”). The pattern of slightly elevated, metaphor-rich narration is taught immediately and maintained without head-hopping or register slips. A tiny limiter is that, under peak stress, the voice remains almost too composed, which slightly flattens the sense of mental degradation or fracture one might expect.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct diction that blends botanical, cosmic, and temporal registers in a consistent way (“galaxy of ancestry,” “silk soaked in dawn”). Psychic distance stays stable: we hover very near her perceptions without slipping into authorial gloss or head-hopping. Rhythms vary and often dovetail with scene beats, slowing around pivotal images (sap, bead, cap) and quickening at turns. At times, the language edges toward uniformly elevated metaphor, which can slightly flatten the sense of a human mind under strain rather than a mythic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, observationally rich, and tailored to a technically minded yet quietly reverent character. Lexicon like “lee-wave rotor,” “katabatic spill,” and precise timestamps feels plausible for her role and deepens texture without sliding into exposition for its own sake. Rhythm and sentence variety are well controlled; lyrical images are balanced with concrete measurements and never break POV plausibility. There is no dialogue to test, but interior focalization under pressure remains steady and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (cosmic-scale metaphors, gentle irony around “hired—though no one remembered posting the job”). Rhythm is well-controlled, mixing long, sinuous sentences with strategically shorter beats at key turns (e.g., “He wept then…”). The diction suits the quasi-mythic tone and never drifts into jarring registers. At times the lyricism approaches density that could risk over-saturation, but it remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-yet-lyric voice is consistent and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature (weight, ash, bees, silence) that clearly belongs to Alden’s way of seeing. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between long, incantatory sentences and slightly tighter beats around the fracture and dream, without losing clarity. Diction remains coherent—elevated but not academic, and appropriate for this mythic, contemplative register. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the controlled repetition of phrases like “tranquilly perceptive” reads as pattern, not glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and distinctive, marked by idiosyncratic metaphors (“polite graffiti,” “unabridged novel” of wheat, “bitten minute”) that reflect a time-obsessed consciousness. POV control is steady; we never slip out of his filter, and moments of exposition (museum, numbers’ strike) are embedded in his sensibility. Sparse dialogue feels natural and economically does character work (the boy’s shrugging pragmatism) while advancing the conceit. The voice is rich without becoming opaque, though it occasionally skirts the edge of preciousness in its density of figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly lyric without losing clarity; diction like “burnished hush” and “loom of almost” feels unified rather than showy for its own sake. The perceptual signature—attentiveness to small fractures and musicality of sound—is very strong and character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but well-pitched and integrated into the sonic texture of the prose. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and the voice modulates gently with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly filtered through Mara’s botanical/architectural sensibility (“micro-current equal to a hummingbird’s heartbeat,” “doorways were nostrils”). Diction and syntax have a distinct rhythmic texture—long, image-rich sentences offset by short declaratives like “Tourists fell silent; even the breeze waited.” Dialogue is minimal but in character, and the single repeated phrase “brazen calm” reads as intentional motif rather than laziness. Lyric compression never drifts into confusion or head-hopping, maintaining a stable, confident narrative stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-close voice is assured, musical, and consistent with a scientifically trained but lyrically inclined mind. Diction choices like “chord struck on a cello made of bone” and “nostalgia’s isotope” feel both character-plausible and tonally unified. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer at the spore inhalation without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping or register whiplash, and the modulation from curiosity to quiet aftermath is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in mythic realism and ecological imagination. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, sustaining an incantatory tone without losing coherence or slipping into exposition. POV distance remains stable; we ride close enough to the coachman to feel his stakes while still accommodating grand, world-level metaphors. A hairline deduction comes from the uniform high-register lyricism, which occasionally flattens modulation across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is a controlled, lyrical third person with a clear perceptual signature—especially in its synesthetic blending of scent, sound, and image (“secret texts in the grooves,” “wild hush”). POV distance and stance are consistent, with brief dips into character consciousness that still feel governed by the same sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, and the elevated narration contrasts effectively with Kite’s simple spoken lines without feeling like a register error. The rhythm varies well and supports pressure; only occasionally does the lyricism risk feeling somewhat uniform across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with controlled rhythm and a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “each photon arriving like a letter delivered decades late,” “heartbeat stretched into whale song”). POV stays coherent—primarily close third with a brief, clearly signaled omniscient glance at future visitors that reads as a deliberate widening rather than a slip. Diction and syntax suit the character and setting: technical touches (“relativistic years,” “magnetic core”) blend smoothly with more poetic constructions. The modulation from cold, humming stillness to the more luminous, almost sacred corridor retains voice consistency under increased emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent, distinctive idiom that fits the fable-like speculative mode. Imagery is inventive yet controlled, and brief dialogue lines are character-specific (Vespers’ aphoristic daring vs. the child’s blunt observation). Psychic distance remains stable; we’re close enough to feel stakes without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. The prose modulates slightly with pressure (climb vs. match vs. descent) while keeping a unified narrative personality.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Mara notices patterns, shadows, and minor gestures. Diction (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) matches the story’s high-concept, post-regal tone without slipping into explanatory exposition. Dialogue is sparse but pointed and character-specific—Kestrel’s first unrehearsed line encapsulates both his training and his break from it. POV remains stable and controlled, letting occasional wide-angle, near-omniscient flourishes feel intentional rather than leaky.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently aligned with the seer’s sensibility; diction like “storm-tasting” and “Encyclopedias of Extinct Verbs” feels native to her mind. POV control is tight—no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience—and brief dialogue from the custodian has a clearly different texture (“Seeking?” / “Reality is rearranged by subtraction”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, compressing at the bargain and climax without losing clarity. The lyric density is high but pattern-taught from the first line, so it reads as an integrated stance rather than decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries technical chess diction to a lyrical, meditative syntax befitting an erudite, self-exiled tutor. Rhythm and register stay consistent while modulating intensity, especially around the decoding sequence and the walk into the maze. The narration never overreaches beyond what Marek can plausibly infer, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The phrase “fierce repose” and the sustained metaphorical texture feel like an organic extension of the character’s mind rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature that could only be Lira’s (seeing pleas as ribbons of light, echoes as accusations). POV control is tight—no head-hopping, and the narrative’s certainty stays within what she can plausibly perceive or infer. Rhythmic modulation is strong: long, image-rich sentences undercut by short, cutting lines at key beats (“Still, the weight did not lift.”). The lushness flirts with overrichness but rarely tips into self-indulgence, maintaining clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong sensory and conceptual signature (“pockmarks like a star map of ruin,” “a tiny sun sinking with her”). Repeated phrases (“Between breaths held underwater”) are pattern-taught and function as structural refrains rather than tics. Psychic distance is controlled: we stay in Lira’s perceptions and knowledge without intrusive authorial explanation. Elevated diction fits the invented world and character without obvious register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically distinctive and consistently tied to Ren’s sensibility, with metaphors (gulls as saws, lane as scar) feeling like a painter’s perception transposed into language. Psychic distance is controlled; we stay inside his noticing without slipping into omniscient explanation, and the occasional aphoristic line (“keys were for people who planned to return”) reads as character-coherent. There’s no head-hopping and no register drift; diction and syntax maintain a unified, confident stance from first sentence to last. The modulation from harsher industrial surfaces to more hushed, cathedral-like cave description mirrors his internal descent and resolution without losing tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyrical, saturated with sensory focus and the lexicon of vibration and tenderness—and it remains consistent throughout. Rhythm and syntax are generally well-controlled, with long, winding sentences suiting the meditative mode without losing clarity. There’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience beyond her plausible inferences, and the final “understanding” about her mother feels like an internal reframe rather than an authorial intrusion. Occasional abstraction slightly dilutes the otherwise sharp perceptual signature, but not enough to undermine the voice’s strength.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person-closish voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently filtered through the navigator’s sensibility, with striking yet coherent metaphors (“the geography of loss has no area codes,” “raw solace shaped like a lullaby sung through teeth”). The rusted-water voice on the phone and her own voice returned are differentiated by texture and function. Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early and maintained without causing confusion. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature: tactile, fungal, and storm-focused, with a rationalist vocabulary fraying under pressure. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, allowing dense metaphor without losing legibility. The register—mixing mystical relic language with quasi-clinical phrases—matches a character who clings to rational frameworks in a surreal, affect-saturated world. POV boundaries are clean; even the brief “voice above me” is handled as an ambiguous presence without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person POV is stable and convincing, with a distinct perceptual signature tuned to light, sound, and absence befitting a lighthouse keeper. Diction and rhythm are consistently lyrical yet purposeful, and figurative language feels like Maris’s way of thinking rather than an imposed style. Temporal and focalization control are solid; even when time blurs around the spectral recurrence, the narrative stance remains coherent. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shift, and the voice modulates tension with control.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with a gently lyrical, old-world narrative texture that fits an antique map dealer in a rainy midsummer town. Diction and distance are consistent; there’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the occasional technical term (“type foundry matrix chip”) feels organic. The voice, while pleasant and clean, is not particularly idiosyncratic or surprising. It carries the story effectively but doesn’t yet feel singular enough for top-tier literary distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“air thinned into lace, a lacy menace”—that feels appropriately heightened for mythic fantasy and remains consistent. Diction and metaphor choices feel like extensions of the queen’s sensibility and situation rather than generic ornament, and psychic distance stays steady throughout. There is no dialogue; all pressure is carried by narration and interiority, which the prose supports without drifting into expository explanation. Occasional doubled images (“lace, a lacy menace”) show the edge of excess but don’t undercut control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Corin’s “scientifically romantic” mind—phrases like “directed spontaneity” and “palette of resolve” feel voice-consistent rather than arbitrary ornament. POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping; we stay inside Corin’s perceptions even when the narration grows more abstract. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (Mira’s rehearsed casualness, her deliberate “accident” of touch) and advancing the emotional turn. At times the register pushes toward purple, but the pattern is taught early and remains legible and coherent through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with metaphors that clearly arise from this character’s mindscape (pages, ladders, wheels, archives). Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter, cutting ones, matching shifts in pressure. The “jaded wonder” tone is well sustained without slipping into register that feels alien to her role or psyche. On the margin, occasional aphoristic constructions risk reading as slightly more essayistic than embodied, but they don’t break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Mira’s, with her professional history and current limitation guiding specific metaphors and observations. The prose sustains a controlled lyricism—“shop of ticking ghosts,” “workshop into a diaphragm”—without drifting into an impersonal or omniscient essayistic stance. Psychic distance modulates smoothly, drawing closer during the screw-reading and widening slightly at the citywide inhale, while never losing focal clarity. There are no POV slips or register breaks that jar against the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically heightened yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature: Lina notices texture, sound, and magical mechanics in ways that reflect both scholarship and trauma. Rhythm modulates well between long, incantatory sentences and sharper, clipped beats at crucial turns (“The eleventh stroke. / … Twelfth stroke.”). Metaphors feel organic to the world (breath crystallizing, steam as a questioning finger) and rarely drift into generic poeticism. POV is steady, with no leakage into Jomei’s interiority, and the single line of dialogue is perfectly calibrated to his role and the story’s tone.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, musically-inflected texture that feels tied to this character and world, and it stays consistent under pressure. Metaphoric diction like “pizzicato whispers” and “microtonal lament” reads as part of her perceptual signature rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but charged, carrying subtext and stakes in very few lines (“Was any of it heard?”; “I was wrong”). The lushness is high, but the POV control and rhythm keep it from drifting into formless lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is assured, consistent, and clearly focalized through a single, distinctive consciousness that thinks in cosmological metaphors and exacting spatial language. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with long, incantatory sentences that match the ritualistic atmosphere while remaining legible. Diction (“spiral arbitration,” “cartographer of endings,” “pregnant universe”) feels unified rather than stitched, and there are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies. At times the elevated register risks uniformity of tone, but it still reads as an intentional, stable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of technical detail and metaphysical musing (e.g., “ocean met sky in an endless negotiation of boundaries”). Sentence rhythm is varied, and the diction—“hydraulic clock shepherd,” “watercolor wash of impossible gradients”—serves a distinctive, slightly archaic-lyric tone. There are moments where abstraction (“world’s relationship with duration”) edges toward neutral essay register, but they mostly stay anchored in Torvald’s specialized way of seeing. No POV leakage or stance confusion undermines the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Maya’s spatial cognition (“nested topographies,” folds) and technical role. Diction occasionally approaches high-register abstraction but remains anchored by concrete sci-fi and biological detail. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct: Voss’s polished corporate-utopian tone contrasts with Luc’s understated greeting and tremor. Psychic distance and tense are steady, and patterning (“quiet wildfire”) is purposeful rather than rote.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (math as prayer, “clover melancholy,” contradictions as field guide). Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled; the free-indirect third-person close to Mira never leaks into authorial explanation in a jarring way. Diction—“traverse,” “lucid contradictions,” “exception that proves the chaos”—fits her intellectual background and emotional state, so the elevated register feels earned. POV remains stable and precise throughout, supporting both atmosphere and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with metaphors (“climbed the tunnel walls like damp ivy,” “cultivated estrangement the way gardeners cultivate orchids”) that feel character-specific rather than generic. POV is stable and confident; we never leave his consciousness, and the lyric register fits his introspective, ritualistic existence. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the child/woman’s questions and final request carrying subtext and plot weight. Under stress, the voice tightens without losing its texture, especially in the gate scene and the emergency-phone beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with distinctive metaphors (“ink blooming like bruised violets,” “gulls laughing like children who knew they were already ghosts”) that feel native to this particular mind. POV control is clean; we never leave the archivist’s consciousness, and distance modulates smoothly between sensory immediacy and reflective thought. Brief dialogue (with the guard, then the daughter) sounds natural and carries subtext, especially in the line “Not lost…relocated to where it can keep listening.” The density of coined phrases is high but disciplined enough that it reads as deliberate style, not noise.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture: long, sinuous sentences, dry wit, and quirky formal phrases (“pallets of hope,” “swap meets of solitude,” “mayor who governed no one”). POV is stable and omniscient-leaning but consistently colored by Kit’s sensibility, especially around logistics, reciprocity, and jokes. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, with Kit and Lila clearly differentiated in rhythm and implication (his creaky showmanship vs. her precise, anarchic deadpan). The prose occasionally skirts the edge of density, but it remains controlled and legible under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in non-visual senses and mapping metaphors. Diction and syntax are consistent with the piece’s mythic, contemplative register and modulate subtly as pressure rises toward the stillpoint. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative never claims knowledge beyond what this consciousness could plausibly infer. The patterned phrasing around sound, touch, and language absorption teaches its own rules early and pays them off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly Mira’s, with a consistent blend of technical and metaphorical lexicon (“quantum buffer,” “filaments,” “static as fertilizer”). Rhythms vary and modulate with pressure, particularly around the rewriting beat and the anomaly’s easing. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative’s confident surrealism matches the SF-mystical premise. At times the diction leans uniformly elevated, but it suits the character and setting rather than feeling like free-floating ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person, semi-omniscient lyric voice is assured, consistent, and distinctive, with rich figurative language and controlled rhythmic variation. The narrator glides through brief focal shifts (advisor, boy, old woman, town) without confusion, maintaining a coherent mythic perspective. Diction and syntax are well-matched to the fable-like register, and psychic distance is modulated smoothly across big images and close, concrete moments. It’s just shy of extraordinary because the voice’s lushness is occasionally uniform, leaving little modulation between contemplative and climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice with its recurring phrase “volcanic tenderness” and emphasis on fire/metamorphosis gives the prose a recognizable texture. POV control is stable and consistent; we stay inside Ember’s perceptions without leaks, and the lyric register fits the mythic ambition of the piece. At times, diction edges toward purple and self-conscious repetition, which slightly flattens its impact. Still, the voice is distinct and coherent, even if not yet refined to an elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong sonic and imagistic signature that fits the sound-driven world. Diction and rhythm are controlled; long, musical sentences match the accumulative, textural drive without slipping into confusion. Psychic distance wavers slightly between close interiority and more authorial abstraction, but the shifts feel intentional and do not muddle focalization. There is no dialogue to test, yet interior phrasing and descriptive angle remain coherently Mira-centered.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third on Mira is steady and confident, with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound, weight, and infrastructure; this specificity grounds the more lyrical geomagnetic imagery. Diction and rhythm feel controlled without being mannered, and tense remains consistent. Dialogue is slightly expository but still reads as speech rather than essay, with the academic vs. worker contrast coming through in content more than accent. The voice maintains coherence under the story’s increasing strangeness, supporting the conceptual turn at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its attention to light-bending, water, and silence. Syntax and diction are controlled—longer, sinuous sentences suit the reflective mood and tighten slightly at key moments (“A hush deeper than silence followed”). There is no head-hopping; the narration’s limited omniscience about the darkness’ “attention” and “question” feels like an extension of her perception rather than a random stance shift. Occasionally the register edges toward ornate (“spiralingly calm,” “tutor it in its own forgotten worth”), but it remains coherent with the chosen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-but-lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (unspoken pieces, breath of buildings, coins needing to “breathe”). Diction and rhythm are well-controlled; long, image-rich sentences are balanced by shorter declarative lines at key beats. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Mara’s way of speaking (“unspoken gambit”) matches the narrative’s metaphorical register. At times the lyricism risks over-saturation, but it never loses track of who is seeing and why.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet coherent, with a distinct maritime-rough tenderness that matches Lira’s psyche. Diction and rhythm are controlled—sentences stretch for lush description but tighten around key turns, like the tremor, whale call, and final release of the scrimshaw. Brief dialogue snippets (“I’m not your guilt, Jack; I’m your exit wound.”) are sharp and character-specific, carrying subtext without exposition. Psychic distance stays stable; there’s no head-hopping or register drift that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: dryly ceremonial, slightly bureaucratic (“Item:…”) yet lyrical, which matches the protagonist’s performative coping. Dialogue, especially from the crow and the officer, carries subtext and distinct idiom while remaining of a piece with the world’s strangeness. POV control is clean, with only a brief, intentional drift into the officer’s perception that doesn’t disrupt coherence. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively toward the ending without losing the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses legal, musical, and optical metaphors into one sensibility. Third-person close focalization stays steady, and the diction—“paraphrase the boundary law,” “borders are parentheses we forget to close”—feels organic to this particular world and protagonist rather than generically ornate. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter lines at key pressure points (“She understood the risk”). The piece teaches its elevated, metaphor-rich mode early and sustains it without jarring shifts in register.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture with strong control over rhythm and imagery (“bruised rainbows,” “language of rust and heat”) and maintains a consistent psychic distance. Focalization through Milo (with brief but coherent access to Rosa) feels stable and character-colored, with perception filtered through his artistic sensibility and later altered vision. Patterned diction and mythic register are taught early and sustained without confusion. A slight tendency toward high-concept phrasing in thematic lines nudges it just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lucid, and lyrically inclined, with a clear conceptual vocabulary around light, sound, and pilgrimage. Repetition of key phrases (“texture of connection,” “golden shadows,” “artificial pilgrimage”) creates a recognizable rhythmic pattern, mostly in a controlled way. There’s no POV slippage or register clash; the distance fits the allegorical, fable-like mode. What keeps it below top tier is that the voice sometimes drifts into generalized abstraction rather than staying tightly tethered to this specific mind and moment.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the liminal, ritualistic action, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in her craft and grief. Sentence rhythm is varied, and the diction knits the metaphysical and the tactile without obvious register clashes. While the narration sometimes slides into generalized abstraction, it remains within a plausible elevated literary register rather than feeling like authorial intrusion from another voice. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance alone carries the piece with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyric, and consistent, with a distinctive blend of occult language and tech/finance diction (“barometrics,” “circuit diagram drawn by mystics,” “dead token’s final trade”). The perceptual signature—filtering everything through cards, grids, and cultural data—is strong and matches her vocation and obsession. There is no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts; even broader contextual statements feel like extensions of her worldview. Occasionally, the register risks feeling a touch more essayistic than character-bound, but it remains coherent and textured.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (memory-inflected, metaphor-forward, sensuous). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the long metaphor chains readable, and psychic distance remains stable. The narrative confidence about surreal phenomena matches the world’s logic, avoiding unmotivated omniscience or hedging. At times the abstraction of diction slightly blurs the historian’s individuality, but the voice itself is assured and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature keyed to color, endings, and tangible memory (stone, reels, orchids). Rhythm and diction are controlled and intentional; the prose modulates slightly at the climax without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the occasional omniscient-tinged line (“future dreamers would sometimes glimpse…”) feels like a deliberate widening rather than leakage. The elevated register fits the mythic, speculative tone and never slides into bureaucratic or academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its animal-focused imagery and ritualistic cadence (“a compass of grief,” “vertebrae of a promise”). Syntax varies to match emotional temperature: longer, image-rich lines in reflection, tighter ones around key choices. There’s no POV leakage or unjustified knowledge; everything is anchored in Miren’s sensibility. A few phrases verge on mannered repetition (“quietly vivid,” “shimmering stillness”), but they feel like deliberate tonal motifs rather than artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confidently controlled, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical signature (“meteor hush of pre-dawn,” “rooting” instead of falling). Psychic distance stays stable; lyric flights remain plausibly within this narrator’s consciousness and never slip into authorial essaying. Rhythmic variation is strong, with long sinuous sentences counterweighted by shorter emphatic ones at key beats. The density of figurative language comes close to excess but is largely disciplined by consistent POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches Mara’s sensibility and the cinematic/mystical frame (“storm without rain, like applause trapped behind velvet curtains”). Diction and imagery are controlled and patterned rather than random, and the narrative distance stays steady and appropriate for a quietly numinous piece. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from eerie quiet to cathartic release is well handled. To push higher, the voice would need a slightly more idiosyncratic edge or surprising rhythm under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., reading the sky “like Braille,” hearing words as “pressure behind her eyes”). Rhythm modulates well, with long, sinuous sentences in meditative beats and tighter phrasing on key turns like “The metal squeaked; the stars answered.” The diction is elevated but fits the character’s star-obsessed inner world and holds steady under emotional pressure. At times the register edges toward uniform rhapsody, which can blur micro-shifts in intensity, but it never collapses into vagueness or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The omniscient-leaning close third has a confident, distinctive music, with patterned phrases (“occasionally everywhere,” “divergent archive”) and controlled cadence that suits the mythic tone. Psychic distance is steady: we stay in the guard’s conceptual frame without head-hopping, and the voice never explains beyond what this world’s rules permit. Repetition and long, flowing sentences feel intentional rather than mechanical, creating a “fractured lullaby” rhythm consistent with the content. Very minor risk of over-uniform lyricism under pressure keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinct, blending technical diction (“coaxial cable,” “binary”) with sensory lyricism without register clashes. POV is stable and focused through the philosopher’s experiential lens, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The jaguar’s single spoken line is tonally integrated and carries thematic weight without breaking the established narrative stance. Patterned phrases (“sound of wind through different trees,” “probable miracles”) are used as deliberate leitmotifs rather than tics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a stable, lyrical, slightly ceremonial texture that suits the mythic setting and never drifts into jarring register. Repetition of key phrases (“shoreline lullaby,” “vigil in twilight,” “star-stamped tickets”) feels pattern-driven rather than lazy, building a ritual cadence. POV distance stays consistent and legible; we’re close enough to Marta and Jun to track stakes without explicit interior monologue. Dialogue is sparse but in-key, serving function without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistently colored by the bellhop’s history and preoccupations (music, metal, silence), giving the narrative a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between slower, reflective lines and sharper present-moment beats without head-hopping or register slips. Elevated diction (“seraphically mundane,” “conceptual repricing” equivalents) feels in keeping with the story’s mythic, almost fable-like distance rather than imposed from outside. There is no dialogue to test, but the silence itself functions as an eloquent gap.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The omniscient-leaning third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a distinct idiom (“voice calm as closed winter,” “dust motes rose like liberated subjects”). Diction and syntax support the mythic, slightly archaic tone without obvious register slips or head-hopping. The narrative stance balances cosmic scale and small physical details of the titan’s movement effectively. At times the compression of high-concept metaphors in close proximity risks slight overrichness, but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyric, and clearly colored by Mira’s professional and emotional sensibilities; metaphors are oceanic, biological, and mechanical in ways that match her. Repeated phrasing (“a practice of tapping rhythms on surfaces”) functions as a deliberate structural and tonal motif rather than a clumsy echo. Psychic distance contracts appropriately in key beats (discovering the atlas page, inserting it into the pillar) while maintaining a composed, observant narrative stance. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions, and the rhythm modulates well between longer, sinuous sentences and tighter, action-focused lines.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphor choices and cadences (“militia’s loudspeakers had rusted into dumb metal flowers”). POV control is steady; we never leave her consciousness, and the narrative’s elevated diction feels plausibly matched to this character’s inner language. Rhythms modulate between long, baroque sentences and tighter beats as pressure rises, supporting mood. The density of figurative language nears excess in places but remains mostly legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically textured, and tightly married to Nara’s sensibility (botanical metaphors, reconstruction-era bitterness, grandmotherly craft). Diction and syntax remain consistent, with no head-hopping or register slips; the narrative stance feels like a seasoned insurgent’s mind filtered through mythic language. Rhythmic control is strong, with long, image-rich sentences used for atmosphere and tighter ones for tactical beats (“She had minutes before his radio crackled.”). Even highly figurative lines (“mineral clouds swirled like galaxies”) stay legible and situationally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled yet character-rooted, with a distinct perceptual signature (botanical Latin, somatic language, war imagery). Rhythm shifts with emotional intensity—long, recursive sentences during reflection; shorter, declarative ones around key acts (“I do not watch it land.”). Lexicon (“somatic markers,” “clerical error,” “arithmetic of continuation”) feels plausible for this narrator and stays consistent. The voice is memorable and confident without sliding into omniscient commentary or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person lyric voice is distinctive and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature: Elian perceives everything as painterly metaphor and mutable coastline, which feels true to his psyche and vocation. Rhetorical questions, rhythmic clauses, and carefully chosen diction (“luminescent ache,” “necessary darkness,” “pages of unwritten atlases”) create a recognizable cadence that holds under pressure. The narrative stance stays tightly bound to his sensibility even as it occasionally lifts into near-omniscient commentary at the very end (the villagers), a shift that feels intentional and thematically coherent. The minor weakness is some tonal sameness—nearly every beat is equally heightened—which slightly flattens modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, clear, and suitably lyrical without losing control; the diction (“serene anger,” “fractal spirals,” “consciously wild”) feels unified and character-compatible. The narrative stays within Kael’s perceptual field, with Lyra’s words filtered through the portal and her journal rather than stray omniscience. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, image-rich sentences and shorter, decisive ones, especially as he approaches and enters the ink. A bit of conceptual exposition at the end feels more like authorial summary than pure character-anchored voice, which slightly flattens the otherwise strong texture.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with patterned but purposeful diction (“dizzying quiet,” “contraband truths”) that fits Sera’s heightened, half-dreaming state. Internal access and narrative certainty remain cleanly bounded by what Sera can infer or hear, even as the city’s reaction filters down as sound and vibration. Rhythm modulates well—from longer, figurative sentences in reflection to tighter beats around the crawl and upload—without losing clarity. The dense lyricism occasionally risks sameness of register, keeping it slightly below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—attentive to texture, color, and quiet—befitting a character who lives through plants. Diction (“engraved quiet,” “tranquil blaze”) is elevated but coherent with the chosen tone and doesn’t slip into mismatched registers. Psychic distance stays steady, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice modulates gently with emotion, though it rarely fractures or roughens under stress, which keeps it beautiful but somewhat even.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled, confidently lyrical, and consistent in its elevated diction, with a distinctive perceptual signature (sound, pattern, and mythic resonance foregrounded in nearly every sentence). Third-person focus tracks Mara cleanly; even when describing cosmic phenomena, the language feels filtered through her vocation and temperament. Dialogue is brief but potent, with the goddess’s line about “every echo owes its life to the first cry” encapsulating the pressure in a voice distinct from the narration. The one risk is a relatively uniform high-register texture that rarely modulates down, though it remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, rich with press and astronomy metaphors that feel specific to Cordelia’s mind and history. Narrative distance is well-controlled, slipping gracefully between image-driven description and concept without head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Dialogue is sparse but tonal and efficient, with Orlan’s wry line about “proving the stars apologize” neatly echoing the established solemn playfulness. The only minor constraint on a perfect score is that, at peak beats, the elevated diction occasionally leans a hair more toward authorial lyricism than strictly character-bound lexicon, though it remains plausible within this heightened fabulist mode.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person, lyric-tilted voice is consistent and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature (“meteor hush,” “sky swallowing its own fire”). Syntax and rhythm modulate well with pressure, growing denser around key turns without losing legibility. The diction—technical (“firmware”) juxtaposed with mythic/cosmic registers—feels purposeful and character-appropriate. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence matches what she can know in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical signature that remains stable and clearly tethered to Mira’s sensibility; diction and imagery are consistently art- and sensation-focused. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with long, lush sentences in contemplative moments and tighter phrasing around key turns (“She answered by sweeping one spiral into a sudden straight path…”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the omniscient-leaning closing gesture about distant listeners still reads as an extension of the established, slightly fable-like narrative presence. The voice’s confidence and control under pressure are high, with no noticeable register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Asha’s tactile and symbolic attention to tesserae and constellations. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, allowing reflection-heavy passages to remain propulsive rather than bogged down. Diction (“retrocognitively trapped,” “empathy’s armor,” “map of forgetting”) feels unified with the speculative-literary register and Asha’s role without lapsing into jargon. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance jumps, and the slight omniscient breadth in the legend coda reads intentional and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct theatrical/synesthetic sensibility—phrases like “citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret” feel character-specific rather than generic. POV is stable and close enough to reflect his perceptions while allowing ornate phrasing that suits a ghost steeped in performance. Dialogue between Casper and Lila is brief but tonally apt and carries subtext about art, longing, and complicity. A few lines brush against over-rich description, but the rhythm and lexicon remain controlled and consistent with the piece’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct texture in its mingling of technical language (“frequencies,” “somatic markers”) and more lyrical phrases (“fractally precise,” “willowglass hope”). Diction generally suits a scientifically inclined artist thinking under pressure, and POV boundaries are respected. At times the narration drifts toward mildly purple abstraction or repetition, which slightly dulls edge and rhythm but never breaks clarity. Overall the voice is controlled and pleasing, if not yet startlingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of sensory mapping and mystical register (“factually mystical,” “afterburn of longing”). Rhythm and diction are well controlled, modulating from hushed description to more incantatory cadence during the channeling sequence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and narrative certainty stays within what Aera can plausibly infer, even when depicting ancestral memories as visions. Occasionally the elevated register flirts with over-ornamentation, but it remains coherent with the story’s chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice is assured, with a distinct lyrical texture (e.g., “every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed”) and consistent diction that suits this uncanny world. Psychic distance is steady; we never head-hop, and the narrative confidence about echoes and buttons matches the quasi-mythic register. Rhythm varies well across long, lush sentences and sharper pivots at structural beats (uncorking the wax, resealing the jar). The only restraint on a higher score is that occasional aphoristic lines verge on authorial commentary rather than staying tightly in her perceptual grain.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically restrained, and clearly marked by this spy’s professional, sensory-biased way of noticing (tools, codes, weather as cover, transmission details). Syntax and diction are controlled and varied, with recurring phrases (“silver hush,” spring tilt, snow) forming a deliberate pattern rather than a tic. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the slight elevation of language feels earned by the reflective, end-of-career frame. Under stress, the voice tightens rather than frays into exposition, preserving a strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, confidently lyrical texture with patterned metaphors and a consistent elevated register. It maintains focalization through the coachman’s situation while allowing a lightly omniscient, fable-like stance that suits the allegorical premise. Phrases like “percolated through the coachman’s memory the way steam rises through ambient awareness” show deliberate rhythmic and lexical control. The only limiting factor is that the diction sometimes feels more like an external stylist than something organically arising from this specific character’s consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a controlled rhythm that suits the contemplative, mythic mode. Metaphors are aligned with the character’s perceptual world (kilns, clay, bees, light) and the psychic distance is stable throughout. The shift to the child’s perspective at the end is clean and still reads under the same overarching lens. A few lines approach over-explication of theme, but the narrative stance remains confident and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is distinctly lyric, with controlled metaphorical threads (oars, light, petals, locks) and a consistent close third-person distance tuned to Mara’s perceptions. Rhythm modulates well between long, sinuous sentences for contemplation and tighter beats for key actions like opening the lock or moving through the stairwell. The occasional conceptual flourish (“translation,” “protected vulnerability”) stays within a believable register for this narrative stance. Under stress, the voice holds steady rather than fraying, which suits the character but slightly flattens potential shifts in psychic distance at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and tailored to this character’s perceptual world—images like “wings folded like a scholar closing a book” marry mind and milieu. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that match the contemplative, high-fantasy register without slipping into abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is steady and appropriately intimate. A marginal drawback is that the uniformly elevated diction slightly flattens modulation between moments of pressure and relative calm.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct lyrical signature—metaphors anchored in thread, light, and paper—that remains consistent without slipping into generic poeticism. Psychic distance is well modulated, moving from wide-shot temple description to intimate sensations (“marble felt warm, alive”) at key beats. Even in peak moments (colors forming sentences, words like henna on skin), the narration remains controlled and legible. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty matches what this focalizer could plausibly perceive within a lightly magical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person narration maintains a consistent, character-appropriate register: technical where needed (“SWR meter,” “ionospheric skip”) yet lyrical in metaphor, blending her scientific and poetic sensibilities. The voice modulates well with pressure, tightening rhythm and sensory focus during the interference sequence and relaxing slightly in the denouement without losing texture. There’s no head-hopping or stance slippage; all knowledge and inference plausibly belong to Lyra. The prose feels like a singular mind noticing the world in a specific way rather than a generic narrator draping style over events.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Arin’s sensibility as a trained, almost ritualistic explorer; diction like “spatial mutiny” and “Meridian Vault” feels native to her world. The narrative filters description through her perceptions (e.g., rails as “jaws of a compass,” tunnels as “drunk sentries”), giving a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well—longer, lush lines for atmosphere; clipped beats (“Arin hesitated only a heartbeat”) at key decisions. The mildly elevated register skirts purple without tipping over, but that lushness is fully pattern-taught and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (method-driven metaphors, clinical-but-poetic language like “Each line was a lance, not of war but of surgery”). Rhythm and diction modulate effectively from incantatory (“Method required opposites to touch”) to sharp, grounded realizations (“Face-blindness had been mercy, not curse”). The brief dialogue at the gate is spare but charged, doing thematic and emotional work without over-explaining. There is no POV leakage or unearned omniscience; even the quarry’s “exhale” reads as filtered metaphor rather than literal head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is a controlled, lyrical close third with a strong perceptual signature—dense, weathered imagery, archival metaphors, and bureaucratic irony that all feel aligned with Mara’s mind. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent, and the few lines of dialogue are functional and in character, especially Mara’s pivotal question to Voss. Psychic distance remains stable; we never head-hop, and the occasional omniscient-leaning phrasing still reads like an intensification of Mara’s perspective. Under pressure (dirigible, discovery, final choice), the voice maintains rhythm and intensity without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in music, photography, and construction. Imagery choices (“scaffold-wrap Morse,” “rasterized yet kind”) feel specific to this narrator’s mind rather than generic poeticism. Psychic distance is well-controlled, maintaining intimacy while allowing mythic overtones. At times the density of figurative language slightly smooths over sharper, character-specific thought rhythms that might heighten immediacy under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with striking but controlled metaphors (“each note soft as a moth wing,” posters glowing “like dying fireworks”) that feel aligned with Jonah’s introspective bent. Diction and rhythm are confident, and the narrative stance remains steady without intrusive authorial explaining. Dialogue is sparse yet functions cleanly to reveal Mara’s role and shared sensibility without expository dumping. There is mild risk that some elevated phrases exceed what Jonah himself would frame internally, but in a literary register it reads as an acceptable, unified narrative intelligence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, contemplative third-person closely tracking the chronicler’s sensibility and a strong perceptual signature in how she reads stars, ink, and grief as interlinked systems. The single slip into “we stood inside both places at once” reads as an intentional brief expansion of the witnessing stance rather than clumsy head-hopping, and the boy’s “speaks only in constellation names” idiom adds texture without disrupting distance. Rhythm and diction are largely well-modulated, sustaining a dreamy register without losing intelligibility. A slight sameness of elevated tone across all beats keeps it shy of the very top tier, as there’s little modulation into rougher or more fractured texture under emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—Briar reads the world through war and nature metaphors (“siege towers,” “war banner,” “unhidden war”). Rhythm shifts appropriately: longer, sinuous sentences build the vortex’s hypnosis, while the confession line is short and scraping. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction feels organic to this character and world. The patterned images (roots, circles, mirrors, sap/scar) are deployed with confidence and clear intention.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—lyric, metaphor-rich, but grounded in a coherent perceptual signature (“root-bound visionary,” pain as antenna, futures as calendars collapsing). POV remains stable and limited to the narrator’s experience; even the prophetic visions are clearly framed as what they witness inside the maze. Rhythm modulates well: lush, long sentences for atmosphere, punctuated by shorter, decisive lines at turning points (“I obey,” “I let the maze drink”). Diction and imagery feel of a piece across the story, with no register slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, balancing lyricism with concrete perception (“holes that whistled at night and let memories leak out like coins through torn cloth”). Lira’s speech and manner are distinct from the narrator’s narrative register, and their brief dialogue feels goal-driven rather than expository. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure; long, lush sentences in calmer beats tighten slightly under choice-points. The only restraint on a higher score is that the retrospective narrator occasionally sounds a bit more essayistic than this character strictly needs, nudging the voice toward crafted authorial wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a strong sonic and tactile bias that matches Mason’s background (“pulse thudded like a kick drum,” wiring syntax like “+52 volts, signal return, safety earth”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled and character-appropriate, and the narrative distance stays stable despite interleaved backstory. There’s no head-hopping, and the compression of time and reflection is handled gracefully. The lyricism stays tethered to Mason’s perceptions rather than a generic omniscient commentator.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a translator and scientist of transition. Diction and rhythm carry a distinct texture—dense but controlled—and the brief intrusion of her mother’s “kindly, methodical” voice feels like a deliberate mirroring rather than a POV slip. The narrative confidently handles abstract concepts without losing emotional anchoring. At times the prose edges toward heightened essayistic phrasing, but it still feels compatible with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent texture: imagistic, slightly formal, and suffused with mechanical-organic metaphors that clearly belong to this world and this consciousness. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and psychic distance stays stable; we are always anchored in her perspective even as the narration zooms out to conceptual frames. There’s no dialogue to test, but interior access is conveyed through how she perceives and names things rather than abstract commentary. A few lines edge toward overt thesis (“memory kept by machines is only storage, but memory kept by water is story”), yet they still feel like this character’s cosmology rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (“the caves hummed like a throat holding back a confession”) that clearly belongs to this character and world. Diction and rhythm are deliberate and modulate subtly as pressure increases toward the mirror and crown. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shift; even the quasi-omniscient-seeming final paragraphs stay anchored in Mara’s transformed vantage. The slight limitation is that the register remains uniformly elevated, which, while fitting here, reduces opportunities for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Lila’s, with a strong perceptual signature (mapping everything, translating emotion into hydrology). Diction balances lyricism and precision, and the narrative distance stays steady without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between longer, sinuous sentences and sharper, action-focused ones during discoveries and the climax. A few phrases flirt with writerly flourish, but they remain aligned with the established sensibility rather than reading as outside authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-closely-held voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctive, with recurring technical phrasing (“through propagation delays”) integrated into a dreamlike register. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the patterned recurrence of motif-phrases reads intentional rather than accidental. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative’s certainty remains bounded by her perceptions and realizations. At the very highest level, one might want slightly more modulation in diction between conceptual exposition and visceral perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lush, metaphorically inventive, and consistently filtered through Lira’s sensibility as a researcher and unwilling seer, with no POV leakage. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, leaning long and sinuous for atmosphere but tightening around key decisions. Lyric strangeness (“old starlight,” “palace of ice suspended above a river of molten gold”) feels unified rather than grab-baggy. The register is high but coherent; a slightly sharper modulation into more clipped interiority at the apex could push this even higher, but as-is the voice is distinctive and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in her mortician-beautician sensibility and pattern-obsessed mind. Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaks occur. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, especially in the ritual and closing beats, without collapsing into confusion. The elevated diction fits the surreal, numinous setting, though it occasionally risks uniform lushness where a single plainer sentence might give contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, with a coherent perceptual signature (grape, tannin, scallop, hush) that feels rooted in this world and character. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, giving the piece a chant-like but not monotonous cadence. Dialogue is sparse but pointed—the boy’s “I am the next you” and “born the instant you forgave” carry subtext and drive plot. The lyric distance never drifts into vague abstraction or omniscient commentary; it stays tethered to her felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that matches Mira’s profession and the story’s speculative-literary mode. Diction (“conscience-for-hire,” “moral radiation,” “protected vulnerability”) feels like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic prose. Dialogue is sparse but effective and character-specific; Mira’s coat metaphor in the climactic exchange carries both theme and pressure without sounding like flat exposition. Psychic distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping or unjustified narrative omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close/limited-omniscient voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a consistent speculative-philosophical register that suits the material. Phrasing like “temporal meridians” and “consciousness as a wave that could propagate in either temporal direction” fits Elara’s intellectual world and the story’s tone. Occasionally the narration lapses into explanatory summary of the science and theme, slightly distancing us from immediate sensation. Still, the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled, with no POV leakage or mechanical dialogue issues.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in ritual, sound, and geology. Diction is elevated but coherent with a mythic, ceremonial frame, and there’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience; everything is filtered through Cael’s sensibility. Rhythm tends toward long, flowing sentences but varies enough that the piece doesn’t feel mechanically patterned. The voice carries the entire story in the absence of dialogue and remains emotionally legible under increasing symbolic density.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet stable, with a clear perceptual signature (tech-meets-magic metaphors like “lilacs and printer toner” or “algorithmic auroras”). Diction and rhythm shift appropriately with pressure—the stair’s instability tightens syntax and focus—without losing coherence. The narrative does not over-explain; it trusts images and Elian’s biased noticing to carry meaning. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the occasional omniscient touch (servers logging a rounding error) feels like a controlled, pattern-consistent zoom rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, close, and distinctly lyrical, with a controlled lexicon that suits the quasi-mythic, synesthetic frame. Patterns like “meteor hush,” “luminous vows,” and sensory cross-wiring feel intentional rather than mannered. The narrative perspective never head-hops and maintains a consistent way of noticing the world that feels specific to Jin’s obsession. Rhythm and diction are confident and textured without major register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with a lush cosmic lexicon (“starlight fossilized,” “lighthouse for ghosts of light”) that aligns with Lira’s role and situation. The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance, dipping into her thoughts without head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. Rhythmic control is generally strong, with sentences modulating to match ritual intensification and climax. Some phrase repetition (“quietly enthusiastic,” “understanding static bursts”) feels slightly patterned, but it mostly reads as intentional motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyric texture (“constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice”) that stays consistent and character-attuned. Distance modulates well, moving from sweeping cosmic description to sharply particular regrets without jarring register shifts. The narration’s slight omniscient tilt (stating what “reapers cannot” do) feels intentional and supports the mythic tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice carries subtext and mood efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear mythic cadence that suits the material. Repetition of structures (“47 seconds. / 46. / 44.”) and short declarative lines is used purposefully to carry rhythm and theme, not as scaffolding. POV distance is stable—slightly distanced from Kael yet colored by his earnestness—and the lone bit of dialogue (from the dolphin) feels naturally of-a-piece with the world. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the narrator’s authority feels consistent across summary and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Marisol’s sensibility—pragmatic yet receptive to nuance and atmosphere. Syntax and diction vary with purpose, sustaining a quiet, watchful rhythm that suits both her profession and the nocturnal setting. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the slight poetic elevation still feels natural for a reflective, solitary night patrol.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is confident, controlled, and consistently lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses scientific and numinous diction (“prime numbers,” “kaleidoscopic curtain,” “burning without heat, sounding like wind through empty pages”). POV is stable close third with no leakage or unjustified omniscience, and the narrative distance modulates smoothly between sensuous description and interior stakes. Rhythms vary effectively between longer, incantatory lines and sharper, declarative beats at key turns (e.g., the moment she lowers the crystal into the flame). The lexicon and style feel plausibly matched to an alchemist’s mind and never lapse into flat or generic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and suffused with her professional, pattern-obsessed way of seeing. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between tense observation and more spacious reflection, maintaining clarity despite lyric density. Metaphors like “soundless echo” and “dawn finally bruised the horizon” feel of a piece with the voice rather than imposed. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the surreal elements are narrated with steady, believable certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a strong lyrical texture that matches the speculative-mystic frame and remains consistent throughout. Dialogue is economical and functional, carrying subtext (especially around fear, resignation, and the dojo’s creed) without lapsing into exposition. Psychic distance is generally well managed, with only light omniscient tinting (e.g., flatly stating Zero has no fear left) that doesn’t disrupt coherence. The perceptual signature—attention to paradox, sensory synesthesia like “tasting color,” and ritualized language—gives the narration personality rather than generic smoothness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lush, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature built around mechanical and botanical imagery (“gears that clicked like anxious teeth,” “roots erupted outward, not downward”). Lyric density feels intentional and patterned rather than random, and the narrative stance—close-ish but slightly elevated over Mira—holds steady without head-hopping. Some phrasing repeats (“safeguard space for innovation,” “orthogonal”) in a slightly thesis-like way, but not enough to break voice cohesion. Overall, rhythm and diction support the surreal, conceptual atmosphere without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., laughter as “a glass marble dropped onto tile,” the tunnel as “concrete throat”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure—longer, lush sentences in reflective beats, tighter ones at turns like the first impossible sniffle. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; lyricism remains plausibly within the narrative register. The diction occasionally edges toward the elevated, but it matches the story’s chosen lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, highly idiosyncratic, and clearly filtered through the guardian’s perception of the world as text and library. Diction and syntax maintain a lush, contemplative rhythm that fits the liminal, post-sleep world and never break POV with intrusive exposition. The narrative confidently juggles abstraction and concrete detail (“breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas”) without losing track of the scene. There is some risk of uniform lushness, but within this short piece the control and distinct perceptual signature remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, cohesive, and stylistically distinctive, with patterned metaphors (“bloom,” “fissures,” “frost”) and a controlled high register that suits an alchemist in a mythic world. POV is stable and limited to his perceptions; even the creature’s communication is filtered through his experience, avoiding head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation works: long, baroque sentences fit the ritual’s build, while shorter beats (“Blind, the alchemist smiled…”) punctuate key turns. The diction skirts the edge of over-elevated but remains consistent enough to read as a deliberate aesthetic rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with a distinct blend of cosmic lyricism and working-world precision (“maintenance hatch,” “primary tuning coil” alongside “constellations across her skin”). POV distance stays stable, hovering in a close third with only minor omniscient flourishes that feel aligned with the quasi-mystical frame. Diction feels appropriate to a specialist operating in a mythic-technical milieu. The lushness occasionally flirts with over-saturation, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built around maritime work, sideways time, and wry resilience. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, supporting both atmosphere and momentum (“like dancing with a ghost who knew the next move”). The few snippets of “voice” via the radio (his own past self) fit cleanly within the narrative stance and avoid head-hopping. There is a minor risk of over-ornamentation, but it largely stays on the right side of controlled lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to the hallucinatory material, with a consistent blend of technical (“neural network”) and sensuous/metaphoric diction. The “fever dream architect” lens gives the language a distinct, slightly clinical surrealism—“rational enchantment,” “realistically imaginary space”—that feels intentional rather than generic. The brief dialogue with the composite man fits the register and functions as an intensification of the concept rather than a jarring shift. Occasional abstraction edges toward uniform texture, but overall the perceptual signature is clear and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in the instructor’s sensibility as a navigator and teacher. Diction choices like “somber marvel” and “balancedly curious” give the piece a distinctive texture without tipping into full self-parody. Dialogue is spare but functional, carrying subtext (her nearly lying to the boy, his parents’ fixation on the hatch) and advancing stakes. Psychic distance is well controlled, tightening at emotional peaks and loosening for world texture.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors (mist as velvet, atrium swallowing sound) that feel organic to Mira’s sensibility and job. The narrative distance is well-controlled, allowing both textured observation and immediate pressure without head-hopping or register slips. Occasional elevated phrases (“Conceptual Repricing”-adjacent abstractions) remain embedded in physical detail, keeping the voice from drifting into detached commentary. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext—especially Hask’s “That photograph belongs to the Ministry” and Mira’s lie about fungus—without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by Mara’s sensorium and fear, with syntax modulating well between dense description and clearer narrative turns. Diction around technical elements (“transatlantic lines,” “fiber,” “cable vault”) stays within a plausible register for the world and meshes with the more poetic phrasing. The brief bits of dialogue—especially Voss’s line—are spare but effective, carrying subtext and advancing the turn without breaking the prevailing tone. Psychic distance is handled confidently; we feel inside Mara’s perception without slipping into omniscient explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—technological metaphors braided with bodily sensation—and maintains a coherent psychic distance throughout. The diction (“defragment myself,” “ride the Wi-Fi like wind,” “voice rough as unspooled tape”) feels like this particular liminal being, not a generic lyric narrator. Rhythm varies effectively between dense, image-heavy lines and cleaner declaratives at key turns (e.g., the morgue drawer heartbeat counts). Occasional aphoristic statements skim close to authorial essay-voice but the character’s conceptual bent makes them mostly plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a consistent mythic-register third-person that clearly belongs to this world and character. Imagery (texture-grammar, veins as filaments, phonograph-heart) builds a distinct perceptual signature that feels like the storyteller’s own way of thinking. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and psychic distance stays stable in a close, interpretive mode appropriate to the fable-like frame. Rhythm modulates well, tightening around the curse awakening and softening into resonance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and consistently filtered through Mara’s mind, blending scientific precision with lush surrealism (e.g., “gravitationally playful fireflies,” “throat full of ice”). POV remains stable, with no head-hopping, and the diction/rhythm modulate effectively as the story intensifies. Recurrent phrasal choices feel like deliberate motif rather than tic. The lyric register is high but controlled enough that it reads as a designed aesthetic rather than accidental flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (iron and apricot tastes, rusted fairy tales, bridges as “hammocks strung between stars”). Syntax and rhythm are controlled; long, ornate sentences are balanced with shorter cadences at key turns, especially around the seed’s uprooting and the orchard’s exhale. The narrator’s knowledge and stance match what this slightly mythic vantage can plausibly know, including the later rumors in the iron cities. While lush, the register feels coherent with the fable-like mode rather than drifting into incongruous abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (neon as veins, drones as hornets, tokens as apologies) that feels particular to Riven’s sensibility. Rhythm is well-controlled, alternating longer, image-rich lines with shorter, declarative beats that carry key turns, and there’s no POV slippage or inexplicable knowledge. Patterned diction around absence/presence and borders is deliberate and supports both mood and theme without breaking stance. At times the register edges toward the uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens modulation under peak stress, but it remains coherent and intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically textured, with diction and imagery tuned to a craftsman habituated to mechanisms, wood, and performance spaces. Syntax and rhythm vary well—long, sinuous descriptive lines give way to shorter, weightier sentences at key turns (“So he sang, not with mouth, but with memory.”), modulating emotional intensity. The narrative never leaks into omniscient fact-dumping; even the more omniscient-seeming lines remain plausibly filtered through his sensibility. The overall perceptual signature—mechanical metaphors braided with religious/performative ones—feels distinct and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature mixing mathematical and poetic diction in ways that fit the premise and Ms. Penumbra’s sensibility. Occasional omniscient-leaning moments (seeing the graduate student’s and poet’s futures) feel integrated with the metaphysics rather than like accidental head-hopping. Rhythm varies nicely between lush description and more expository sentences. At times, explanatory “she understood now” constructions flatten the lyricism, but not enough to seriously damage voice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric signature: dense but controlled metaphor, rhythmic clauses, and a mythic-register lexicon that clearly belongs to this world. POV distance is stable; we never leave Mireya’s psychic space even when the narration grows more panoramic (“as though the archipelago itself were being developed”). Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught; the prose trusts the reader to inhabit its invented logic without over-explaining. Under peak beats (the decisive frame, light implosion), the voice tightens but does not break tone or slide into expository explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“improbable longing,” “hush of cosmic possibility”) that clearly reflects this particular locksmith’s mind and world. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that suit the mythic, contemplative pressure, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative confidently manages abstraction while staying anchored in tactile images (frost-slick marble, ink in the mouth, scar as tuning string). It’s distinctive and publication-ready, if slightly homogenous in its elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly shaped by a folklorist’s sensibility—notice how scientific terms (“field journal,” “tincture”) and mythic diction (“when stars fall to earth”) comfortably coexist. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; everything is filtered through Mara’s perceptions and interpretive frameworks. Rhythm modulates well—long, lush descriptive sentences give way to tighter action clauses at key beats (selecting the scalpel, slicing the mushroom). The voice is distinctive without tipping into self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close-third/lyric narrative voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with strong control of rhythm and image (“Lira smiled the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut” is exemplary). POV is stable; we never slip confusingly into other consciousnesses even as the narration takes on a slightly omniscient, fable-like texture at times. Dialogue is sparse but age-appropriate and subtextual, letting the ritual movements and glances carry meaning. The density of figurative language is high but patterned and intentional, supporting the surreal tone instead of feeling like random ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, assured, and well-matched to the mythic-fable mode, with a clear perceptual signature in how it fuses botany, craft, and light. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent, and the narrative distance stays stable around Arin’s worldview without intrusive authorial commentary. Rhythmic control is strong—long, flowing sentences at the contemplative start, slightly tighter cadence around the tuning-fork beat and the veil’s opening. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the closing modulates tone slightly toward retrospective myth without breaking the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature focused on touch, light, and silence. Metaphor choices (“eye threaded with moonlight,” “man-shaped absence”) feel both character-filtered and tonally coherent with the slightly numinous world. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the fisherman’s “You’re grounding me,” which carries subtext without overexplaining. The only constraint on a higher score is occasional narration that leans more toward authorial summarizing insight than fully embodied focalized thought.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently colored by Elara’s cartographic sensibility; metaphors of maps, borders, tears, and frames feel organic to her. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, contemplative sentences and sharper precisions, and the free-indirect access to her perceptions is stable. The narrative does occasionally step closer to essayistic exposition than strictly necessary, but without losing focalization or emotional coherence. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinctive and well sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confidently controlled, with a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Mara’s analytical yet haunted sensibility. Diction and syntax are intentionally elevated but feel coherent with a scientist-like mind steeped in metaphor, and the few dialogue lines are spare, in-character, and subtext-heavy. The narrative distance stays stable, with brief expansions (e.g., about Earhart’s last call) still clearly filtered through Mara. A handful of lines flirt with essayistic abstraction, but overall the voice remains specific and character-rooted rather than generic-poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyrical voice is distinctive, with consistent storm-and-signal metaphors that feel organic to Lyra’s sensibility. Phrases like “static that lived between lightning and thunder” and “wings ticking out binary lullabies” show controlled, character-inflected diction rather than generic prettiness. POV distance remains stable and the rare dialogue lines are in tune with the surrounding register. Some repetition of favorite constructions (“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong wonder”) is noticeable but not enough to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lira’s sensibility; metaphors (e.g., “melody… anguish dressed in confetti”) feel like expressions of how she thinks rather than authorial imposition. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with long, baroque sentences balanced by clean pivots (“The elevator dinged; the tenth floor corridor smelled of cold iron and old paper.”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence matches the quasi-fantastical world. At moments the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, but it still reads as a coherent, singular voice rather than generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically distinct and consistent, with metaphors (“propeller trying to remember its own name,” “dusty starlight”) that feel anchored in Mara’s sensibility and vocation. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between descriptive reverie and sharper, shorter beats when the cable frays or the gondola lurches. POV control is clean; there is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. The density of figurative language is high enough that, at the most elite level, an editor might trim a few flourishes to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive texture, blending sensory precision with mathematical and astronomical diction that fits a face-blind, fractal-minded artist in a scholar’s guild. Perceptual bias is consistent: she notices weight in shoulders, speech in hands, negative space between people and shelves, rather than conventional facial detail. Rhythm varies well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter, stress-marking phrases (e.g., at the siren and explosions). There is no POV drift or unmotivated register shift, and lyricism remains under control.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-filtered, with metaphors that feel like Lira’s perceptions (maps, currents, after-images) rather than generic ornament. POV is stable and modest about knowledge, never slipping into head-hopping even when the crew gathers. Rhythm varies well, with long, textured sentences balanced by shorter, weight-bearing lines at key beats (“Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn; got one?”). The elevated diction fits the fable-like, slightly archaic world and never drifts into anachronistic register.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in clocks, moons, metal, and frost, and it maintains stable focalization through Rowan. Diction and rhythm feel carefully controlled, with recurring syntactic patterns (“when…,” “because…”) used for emphasis rather than as scaffolding. The narrative distance stays tight enough to blend his interiority with the descriptive texture without head-hopping or authorial intrusion. A few turns of phrase (“driftwood nostalgia,” “another craftsman’s dreams”) flirt with writerly ornament, but they never fully sever the link to his consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a consistent perceptual signature—rich metaphors tied to orchards, gravity, bells, and nebulae—without losing narrative control. There’s a good modulation of rhythm between more expansive, image-heavy lines and tighter, action-focused ones, especially around the harvest. POV distance and stance remain steady, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. The voice is distinctive and memorable, just shy of the absolute precision needed for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent: lyrical, precise, and anchored in the adjuster’s perceptions (“boots sinking into damp sand that remembered every footstep she would ever take”). POV remains stable despite cosmic scales and lifetime flashes, and the diction’s elevated register fits both her role and the mythic situation. Rhythmic modulation (longer syntactically rich sentences broken by shorter certainties like “She understood then the method”) effectively tracks emotional peaks. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and stable in distance, with a clear perceptual signature in how Mara notices mechanics, cold, and constraint. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, tightening around moments of threat (the bird’s approach, the final fork) and relaxing slightly for reflection without stalling. Diction fits the world and character, leaning elevated but not implausibly so for the mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty stays within what Mara can infer.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by a scientifically trained, metaphorically attuned mind. The prose sustains a distinctive texture (polymer analogies, acoustic and tactile notices) without losing track of narrative clarity. Shifts between ravine and lab maintain the same perceptual signature, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels earned by the character and mode. There is a risk of the lyric register becoming a bit uniform across beats, but it never slips into confusion or obvious register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is assured, rhythmic, and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches the surreal premise. Diction (“algorithm of absence,” “parole word”) feels unified and intentional, and brief dialogue is natural within the stylized frame, carrying subtext and world rules efficiently. POV distance remains stable; we stay close enough to the vendor’s functional perspective without head-hopping, even when glimpsing the librarian’s constructed nature. At times the elaborateness of phrasing risks overshadowing character interiority, which is what holds this a shade below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—sensorial, culinary, and mineral—that feels coherent with Marisol’s identity and the story’s concerns. Diction and syntax are lyrical without becoming opaque, and the narrative distance stays steady, avoiding head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Extended metaphors (fortress weeping, pavilion as throat) are controlled and pattern-consistent, contributing to a unified perceptual signature. There is minimal explanatory scaffolding; most information arrives via her embodied noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    The omniscient-lyric voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and consistently colored by Mireya’s musical/linguistic sensibility (“gears whispered and constellations leaned close to listen”). Diction and syntax are rich but not random; images like “a roadway of resonance no silo could contain” demonstrate a coherent perceptual signature. The few snippets of dialogue (the elevator’s line in particular) carry subtext and thematic pressure without breaking the register. This is a strong, distinctive voice that would be at home in a prestige venue.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a dense, metaphor-rich register that matches the character’s technical and visionary mind. Phrasing like “watchmaker having seizures” and “helix-minded engineer” creates a strong perceptual signature that never drifts into generic exposition. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; even the miners’ dreams are accessed through the logic of the device and Mara’s embodied experience. A few images flirt with excess, but overall rhythm and distance are well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“prism-minded,” “threshold effects,” “seeds of vigilance”) that feels native to Ilyra’s worldview. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively, sustaining a lyrical but intelligible flow under pressure. World terms are taught through use rather than exposition, and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The only small brake on a 9+ is that the lyric register stays fairly even; a sharper modulation at peak danger could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is highly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature obsessed with pitch, texture, and the emotional lives of materials. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—more incantatory during ritualistic acts, calmer in observation—without ever becoming opaque. Diction stays coherent with Ilay’s artistic, semi-poetic sensibility and never breaks into jarring registers. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the lyric narration remains anchored in her way of knowing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly colored by a chess-obsessed, analytic mind; metaphors and diction (“openings and endgames,” “transposition,” “crystalline beauty”) consistently reflect that sensibility. Rhythm is mostly controlled, with long, flowing sentences suiting the meditative mode. There is some sameness of register and cadence over the length, leading to a slightly uniform musical line that softens peak beats. Still, the perceptual signature is distinct and coherent, with no POV slippage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, consistent, and saturated with Mirelle’s sensibility—synesthetic, theatrical, and pacifist-obsessed with sound. Rhythms and imagery are tightly controlled, with recurring performance metaphors (polite applause boots, sky as audience) that reinforce tone. There is no POV leakage or mechanical exposition; even abstract concepts are filtered through this poetic register. The density of figurative language is high but mostly purposeful and pattern-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and sensorially biased in a way that matches Myrrh’s profession and sensitivity; phrases like “tide’s thought” and “moon-mulled violets” feel like her interior idiom rather than generic prettiness. POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping—and even when the diction is elevated, it remains coherent with a character who lives in ritual and scent-driven metaphors. Rhythm modulates well: long, breathing sentences suit the hush and sway, with occasional shorter cadences at key turns (“She greeted them the way her mother taught: exhale slowly, let your scent speak honesty, then wait.”). The absence of dialogue is appropriate and underlines the piece’s attention to breath, silence, and scent as its communicative medium.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent sensibility that marries pilot pragmatism to near-mystical attentiveness (“irrigation streams…like music scores,” “roots were rays of light”). Rhythm varies well, balancing long, image-rich sentences with shorter cadential pivots at key turns (“Then gravity let go.”). The narrative never over-explains and keeps close to Aera’s experiential frame, even in more conceptual passages. The lyricism is elevated but feels organic to the world rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct blend of technical precision and dreamlike metaphor that fits Mara’s role and the “hazy precision” brief. The narrative never slips out of her perceptual frame, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels like her disciplined, slightly numinous worldview rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm varies effectively between clipped observational notes and longer lyric sentences as pressure builds. A few metaphoric flourishes verge on ornate, but they don’t break voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person, close-focalized voice is distinctive and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature built around synesthetic cross-mapping of sound, color, and emotion. Diction and rhythm are consistent with the piece’s mythic-lyric register, and the narrative distance remains stable; we never slide into unmotivated omniscience or prosaic explanation. The main limitation is that the voice leans uniformly lush; a bit more modulation between intense lyricism and plainer phrasing at moments of decision could heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility; phrases like “time pools like dead birds” feel like her mind rather than generic ornament. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with long, lush sentences used to build atmosphere and shorter clauses to clinch key turns. Psychic distance remains steady; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly infer. The absence of dialogue suits the solitary, interior pressure of the piece and avoids any register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice has a strong, coherent texture—technical yet lyrical, with recurring mathematical and printing metaphors that feel earned by Quince’s vocation and obsession. Psychic distance is well managed, flexing between close interiority and slightly more panoramic descriptions of the sky without head-hopping or stance confusion. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, supporting both dreamy ambiguity and sharp turns at key beats (“Between vanishing stars he made his choice…”). The elevated diction consistently matches the surreal, high-concept mode and Quince’s reflective cast of mind.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical texture that fits a mythic fantasy register. Diction and imagery (“liquid sky,” “weight of centuries,” “weight of becoming”) are coherent and recognizable as a single, confident narrative stance. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough, and the brief omniscient tilt to the villagers’ later perspective is clear and doesn’t break the lens. At times, the voice leans more into authorial abstraction than Elias-specific perception, which slightly flattens the perceptual signature under peak thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and consistent with an “attentive mystic”: elevated diction (“aggregate sorrow baked into vinyl and steel,” “resonating with the glass in his hand”) feels character-appropriate. The perceptual signature—scientific-mystical noticing of frost patterns, light spectra, and mineral song—is distinctive and cohesive. Psychic distance is well managed, tightening around key beats without abrupt shifts or authorial intrusion. There’s no dialogue beyond his brief utterances, but these lines are purposeful and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with strong rhythmic control (“cider and copper and goodbye”) and a distinctive perceptual filter (textiles, threads, seams). Syntax and diction are elevated but coherent for the mythic-fable mode; there’s no head-hopping or register drift. The narrative distance tightens appropriately at the sacrifice and relaxes into broader seasonal summary without feeling abrupt. A few metaphors cluster densely, but they read as deliberate texture rather than unintentional clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with a consistent lexicon that suits the mythic, fable-like mode. Repetition patterns (“space between understanding and confusion,” “azure defiance”) feel deliberate and rhythmic rather than mechanical, reinforcing motif. Psychic distance holds at a measured, slightly elevated remove that matches the story’s allegorical lean, and there is no POV leakage. The main limitation is that the high, uniform register sometimes softens the immediacy of Thistle’s personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in tactile and sonic detail befitting a sensory cartographer. Lyric density and recurring diction (“weave,” “redirect,” “cyclically spontaneous”) form an intentional pattern rather than haze. The narrative never oversteps her plausible knowledge; revelations arrive with her. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from dreamy to charged to resolute reads controlled rather than melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s perspective and maritime experience. Syntax and diction are varied and musical without sliding into self-consciousness, and the narrative distance holds steady in a limited, intimate band. The metaphoric register (“salt-ghost of every ship,” “luminescent ache”) matches the tone and character knowledge, and reflection is always grounded in immediate sensation or action. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent, mythic third-person that matches Lirael’s role and the scale of events. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, allowing long, image-rich sentences without losing legibility. The perceptual signature—obsession with print, light, and weather metaphors—feels distinctive and coherent across the piece. High lyric density occasionally risks uniformity of register, but it never lapses into flat abstraction or clumsy shifts in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textural, and clearly filtered through Hoshiko’s sensibility as a dye master—she understands the world in pigments, patterns, and light. Lexicon choices like “valley-mist wonder,” “narrative magnetism,” and “story-ways” feel cohesive with the speculative premise and not like external essay-voice intrusions. Psychic distance is well-managed, staying intimate while occasionally widening for lyric effect without losing her anchoring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s practical yet wonder-tuned sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (mercury beads, numbered trees, quantified sorrow) building a recognizable narrative texture. The prose modulates appropriately between storm-lit grandeur and quiet, almost procedural attention to repair. There’s no head-hopping or register drift that would disrupt the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is consistent, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm that match the surreal, allegorical frame without drifting into abstract generality. Diction like “obsidian panes,” “tarry vines,” and “a scab over collective amnesia” feels of a piece with the world and the focalizer’s sensibility. Psychic distance modulates well—zooming into bodily sensation at peak beats (shards in ribs, phosphor sting) and out to conceptual revaluation at the lens-of-worlds moment—without breaking focalization. There’s no dialogue to test, but narrative voice alone carries texture and pressure convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a lyrical but coherent texture (“the stacks exhaled a hush so complete it seemed to enlarge tranquility itself”). Diction and rhythm remain stable, modulating naturally with tension (e.g., the lantern approach vs. the dissolving hush). There’s no POV leakage; even abstract lines feel like extensions of Elara’s sensibility. The narrative confidence and patterning (repeated paradox language, “hush,” “absence”) feel deliberate rather than mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice has a distinct, controlled lyrical texture—phrases like “heuristically gentle” and “flour ghosts” feel idiosyncratic but coherent with Mila’s perceptual style. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the gardener’s brief dialogue is concise, charged, and tonally aligned (“Guilt rises like yeast; plant it”). Rhythm and diction modulate well between atmospheric description and key realizations, maintaining legibility despite high figurative density. The piece teaches its slightly heightened register early, so later flourishes read as intentional rather than overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct lexicon (quartz hush, frozen mercury, frequencies of light) that matches the character’s role and the world’s physics. Psychic distance is well-controlled, sliding between precise external detail and interior reflection without leakage or omniscient drift. Diction is elevated but coherent for the mythic, post-empire register, and patterning (e.g., repeated “gently meticulous”) feels intentional rather than robotic. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries texture and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady, with an effective mix of concrete smuggler-world idiom (“white lightning,” “gutted on deck”) and more poetic metaphors. POV distance is well controlled; we stay inside her perception, and the few mythic-feeling claims (about the widow’s tear, for example) read as her belief, not authorial intrusion. Rhythm varies nicely, with short, sharp sentences punctuating longer, rolling ones to match emotional intensity. There is some density of figurative language, but it feels like a coherent voice rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is a controlled, lyrical third person with a distinct sensory signature (weather-as-taste) and consistent diction. Phrases like “terrestrially cosmic light show” and “futuristic nostalgia” signal a specific, cohesive narrative sensibility rather than generic prettiness. POV distance remains stable, never leaking into omniscient commentary beyond what fits a close-lens lyric narrator. Occasionally the register leans toward abstract thematic phrasing, but overall rhythm and word choice feel deliberate and character-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature—charcoal, geology, memory, and sound interwoven in metaphors that feel native to this character’s mind. Third-person close remains stable and does not overreach into omniscience; even the chorus of past sitters is framed as the cave’s response rather than a narratorial cheat. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer, image-rich sentences balanced by shorter clarifying beats, especially near turns (“She pinned the parchment to the crystal wall…” / “When the final wheel turned, the lock snapped open…”). A few high-register constructions brush against stylization, but they support rather than dilute the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Aurelia’s sensibility as a calligrapher in love with material language. Diction and syntax form a distinct texture—“zinc-etched postal plate fragments,” “gilded letters curled like scorched petals”—without feeling mismatched to the character. Brief dialogue is minimal but apt, and the near-silent interaction with Corin is carried by shared action and perception rather than expository speech. Psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping despite the late arrival of Corin’s presence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, confident, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in sound, resonance, and crafted metaphor. Diction choices like “frequency of human wonder,” “breath-scriptures,” and “infinite viola” feel unified to her métier rather than arbitrarily ornate. Psychic distance stays stable; there is no head-hopping, and occasional aphoristic lines still plausibly arise from this myth-tinged world. Rhythm varies well across sentences, tightening slightly around the comet and relaxing again in the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice tied to an android consciousness is consistent, lyrical, and confident, blending technical lexicon (“servos,” “neural networks,” “programming”) with poetic perception. The perceptual signature—reading emotions via plant chemistry, thinking in terms of protocols and fields—feels particular to K-17. Rhythm modulates well between expository stakes and charged images without losing clarity. There are no POV slips or gratuitous explanatory asides; elision is purposeful and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Mira notices discarded objects and ambient sounds. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—from long, flowing accumulations in rumor-filled passages to tighter, hushed lines during the vigil—without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping; narrative certainty stays within what Mira could plausibly infer, including the slight ambiguity in “heard, or imagined she heard” at the end. The lyricism feels motivated by character and setting rather than generic “poetic” overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is a confident, lyrical close third, with a distinctive sensory and metaphorical palette that feels consistent with Mara’s hybrid of dancer and code breaker. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences suiting the underwater setting and more concise phrasing at turning points (e.g., “She rolled; the dice obliged.”). There is no head-hopping or register drift; the few explanatory sentences (“they had tried to liberate the world from fear…”) still feel voiced rather than expository intrusion. The only restraint is that the lushness is nearly uniform—slightly more modulation under peak stress could add even greater dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, balancing lyricism with clarity and never slipping into authorial explanation. Miren’s perceptions (gravity as broken glass, “gleaming silence,” currents that “remembered its weight”) give a strong perceptual signature that feels specific to her world and work. Rhythm and diction are well-controlled, with varied sentence lengths and no head-hopping or register drift. Compression of backstory (coffee grounds divination, archivists) is handled through vivid, in-character images rather than expository blocks, maintaining the accumulative, enchanted tone.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with patterned metaphors (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush”) forming a recognizable idiom rather than random ornament. Close third-person focalization is steady; we never slip out of his experiential filter even as the narration grows mythic. Rhythmic control is strong—sentences lengthen for incantatory effect and tighten around crucial actions like speaking the “.” and swallowing the sphere. A few turns of phrase skirt the edge of self-conscious flourish, but they don’t break the coherence of the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: quick, metaphorically agile, and consistently tuned to architecture and language (“meteor scratched its silver signature,” “future perfect of load-bearing walls”). POV control is stable and plausible; the narrator’s knowledge is grounded in lived ritual and the tutor’s lessons, with no head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation—long, syntactically rich sentences for reflection; tauter clauses for turning points—feels intentional and supports the lyric mode. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (the lies they choose) without breaking the established narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lush, slightly elevated register that suits Mara’s haunted rationalism. Metaphors like “trespassing inside a bruise” and “black as vinyl” feel distinctive and tied to her sensibility rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay in her perceptions even as the narration compresses time at the end. At moments the diction skews toward thematic abstraction, but it rarely loses the anchor of concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Mara’s sensibility as a calligrapher and forger; diction like “calibrated treason” and “pearl twilight” feels deliberate rather than random. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. That said, some repeated phrasing (“calibrated treason,” “heritage rose thorn”) and overt thematic statements give the prose a slightly prompt-bound, declarative flavor in places. The fragment “the blood-written confession of a” jars the otherwise controlled rhythm and undercuts the line’s intended weight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is a confident, lyrical close third, with a distinct sensory signature (sound- and taste-inflected perceptions) that stays coherent throughout. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent with the mythic/fable register, and shifts in rhythm (denser in the gallery, airier at the rim and dawn) track emotional shifts effectively. Brief bits of dialogue are spare but weighted and suit the setting’s tone. The only small limit is that the high lyric register rarely loosens, so we don’t see much modulation into rougher or more fragmentary texture under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“borrowed starlight,” “memory leaks from one soul to another”) that feels tailored to Marrow’s profession and world. Rhythm and syntax vary well, giving the prose a distinctive music without sacrificing clarity. The narrative distance remains stable, and any omniscient-leaning flourishes read as part of a controlled, mythic register rather than POV slippage. It’s a high-literary voice that would sit comfortably in a prestige venue.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrical yet coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature that notices patterns, textures, and labor (“dark commas on the marble,” “shape of absence”). Diction like “scintillatingly somber” and “demure audacity” feels native to this character’s contemplative, craft-inflected mind rather than imposed. POV distance and knowledge stay stable; there’s no head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Rhythm modulates well, lengthening for description and tightening around key turns (the foot-strike, the inscription, the oarsman’s shift).

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a confident, slightly baroque lyricism that fits the post-collapse, radioactive fable tone (“Geiger counter…clicked like an angry cicada,” “dust drifts rose like ghost tides”). Diction feels plausibly aligned with Marisol’s educated, technical background without slipping into cold exposition, and the narrative distance stays stable throughout. Rhythm is well-controlled, with longer, lush descriptive sentences balanced by shorter, punchier beats at key moments (the ground sighing open, the Geiger going silent, then screaming back to life). There’s mild risk of over-rich metaphor, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads like a coherent aesthetic choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident and distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature (mix of technical grit and mystical static). Diction like “variant allegiance,” “residue of every future that had collapsed into this present,” and “bomb from radio parts and regret” feels internally consistent with Elara’s mind and the story’s register. Rhythm varies well between long, lush sentences and sharper beats at key actions, supporting emotional modulation. The lyricism never devolves into incoherence, even as it leans dense.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and confidently lyrical, with metaphors that mostly feel organic to Posy’s sensibility (“apricot salt,” “bones humming with the lonesome splendor”). Third-person close POV is stable and doesn’t leak knowledge Posy couldn’t plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates well between lush description and more direct narrative moves at the ritual and climax. A few phrases verge on pile-up, but they don’t seriously disrupt distance or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person-close voice is confidently lyrical, with a strong sonic and imagistic signature that fits a character who thinks in terms of resonance and engineering. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and sensory focus (especially on sound) clearly reflects Mireya’s perceptual bias. Even under peak stress, the voice doesn’t fracture or flatten, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift. The one limiter for going higher is that the elevated lyricism is very uniform; a touch more modulation between high-intensity and quieter stretches could sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet consistent with a trained, sensorily-attuned mapper: metaphors track to his tools and environment (compass, rails, ice, breath). Rhythms modulate effectively, with long, sinuous sentences during observation and tighter phrasing at key turns (“At the precise instant… Elian pressed his compass to the ice”). The perceptual signature—reading polarity as “breath,” maps that “suddenly looked like tomorrow”—is distinctive and coherent, with no POV leakage or register drop. The narrative confidently withholds only what Elian is actively discovering, so elision feels like craft rather than manipulation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well controlled, with a distinct rhythm and lexicon that feel appropriate to a seasoned investigator carrying trauma. Imagery like “the tunnel stretched before her like a throat” and “the numbers felt hollow, like bones picked clean” gives the prose texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as memories intrude and as Mara discovers the journal, then relaxes at the exit. There’s minor flirting with elevated diction, but it suits the reflective, noir-inflected tone and never breaks POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Emil’s sensibility and the shop’s tactile world. Dialogue for Emil and Olya is distinct, concise, and subtext-driven, revealing status and worldview (her mechanical fatalism vs. his theological doubt) without exposition. The elevated diction and figurative flourishes suit the quasi-gothic tone and don’t break POV plausibility at this length. Psychic distance modulates smoothly around key beats (the repair, the decision about the journalist) to heighten pressure without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: steampunk-lyric diction, inventive compounds, and a sly confidence that matches Juniper’s temperament. The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge outside Juniper’s scope. Rhythmic control is strong, with long, baroque sentences used to luxuriate in concept and shorter ones to punctuate turns (“Arlo dipped…”; “She laughed—an irreverent bark—”). The voice feels unified and character-inflected rather than generic ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person/limited omniscient voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature mixing technical metaphors (“rattled like a dying hard drive”) and elegiac tone. Diction fits the character’s milieu—corporate-technical laced with lyricism—without obvious register breaks. Compression and elision are handled confidently, moving through years and major revelations while keeping the focal lens on the keeper. A slight distance from her moment-to-moment emotional flux keeps it from feeling absolutely singular, but control and texture remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically consistent, and clearly anchored in Mara’s sensibility, with patterned but controlled metaphors (“bruise-colored clouds,” “boots silent on planks soaked with other people’s grief”). Psychic distance is well managed; we stay close enough to feel her choices without losing the mythic register of the narration. The brief spoken phrase (“I witness you whole”) is tonally congruent with the surrounding language and functions as action rather than exposition. It stops just shy of exceptional because the elevated register sometimes flirts with overstatement, particularly in a few theme-forward lines.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature around sound, texture, and metaphor that feels consistent from opening through the time-jump. POV stance starts close to Mara and then gradually widens into an almost fable-like omniscience (“Years later, when the boy grew into a man…”), but the shifts are clean and purposeful rather than confusing. Syntax and rhythm are varied, with long, sinuous sentences that fit the contemplative mode and shorter, charged moments at key turns (the horn, the tapping of the parasol). The only restraint is that the elevated diction occasionally risks feeling more like an authorial lyric voice than something fully anchored in Mara’s psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in agricultural metaphor and tactile detail. POV is stable and consistent in distance, blending close interiority with a lightly elevated diction that fits Marco’s reflective mode. A few abstract phrases (“intersubjective understanding”) brush against his presumed lexicon, but they don’t meaningfully break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, ceremonious, and well-matched to a quasi-mystical ritual. Diction and syntax form a consistent rhythmic texture that feels like the walker’s contemplative mind extended, with recurring attention to periphery, sound, and subtle mechanics. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the narrative confidence is high. At times the register veers toward abstract-philosophical, but it remains coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinct and confident, with a recognizable rhythm and a strong penchant for metaphor (“metronome counting grief,” “forgiveness practicing its vows,” “penny candy” sorrow). POV is stable and legible, with lyric omniscience that fits the fable-like, magical-realist tone. Diction is mostly well controlled and coherent with the character and world. At times the density of figurative language risks self-consciousness, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lucid, and lightly lyrical, matching a scholar’s sensibility without sliding into academic jargon. Diction is consistent, with periodic flourishes (“quiet apocalypse of language,” “weathered innocence”) that feel character-apt rather than decorative intrusions. Psychic distance is well managed, letting us inhabit Elara’s perceptions while maintaining a slightly elegiac narrative frame. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation at the end toward a broader, almost mythic future lens still reads anchored in her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built around junk, media decay, and fog. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative mode without losing clarity. There’s no POV leakage or register drift, and the narration’s elevated diction feels earned by the “prophet” framing rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses technical detail (Hasselblad, spectrographs) and metaphoric thought (“escape velocity became a lullaby sung by metal fatigue”). POV control is tight—no head-hopping, no unjustified knowledge—and the narrative stance modulates smoothly with rising pressure. Patterned diction (“luminous ache,” “changelessly constant”) reinforces tone rather than feeling like scaffolding. The density of lyricism occasionally risks homogeneity of rhythm, but not enough to blur Mira’s interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that translates sounds and scents into music and hope. Occasional figurative flourishes (“silence to grow teeth,” “velvet held underwater”) feel motivated by Mara’s sensibility and the heightened liminality of the setting rather than by authorial display. Dialogue is spare but natural and character-specific, with Calderon’s dry humor (“Thought vinyl was extinct”) contrasting Mara’s composed, slightly stylized replies. Psychic distance remains steady; even reflective lines about her training are clearly her thoughts rather than sudden omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, balancing cosmic strangeness with precise mechanical detail (“iris diaphragms widening like memory,” “Möbius band of night”). The perceptual signature fits a contemplative, academically inclined protagonist—attuned to geometry, runes, and instruments—without drifting into jargon. There is minimal dialogue, but what appears (the automaton’s “State epoch” exchange) feels tonally integrated and functional. The voice maintains coherence through the surreal turns, though occasionally it leans into overt thematic declaration at the end, slightly loosening the otherwise tight modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent with Elara’s sensibility as a bone-setter steeped in folk magic and doubt. Diction choices (“opalized,” “nostalgic innovation,” “conceptual cleft”) feel like extensions of the story’s mythic-intellectual register rather than imported jargon. The changeling’s brief dialogue (“I kept the tooth as ransom…”) carries a distinct, fluting timbre that still harmonizes with the narrative voice. Psychic distance modulates smoothly between external action and dense interiority without head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, marrying cosmic vocabulary (“lunar craters,” “constellations”) with tactile grotto and domestic details (quilts, driftwood tongs). Syntax and rhythm modulate gracefully between long, lush descriptive lines and tighter, action-focused sentences at key beats (the drop of water, the crack like splitting ice). Imagery choices clearly arise from Lira’s perceptual habits as a star watcher and child of tide and cloth, not from a generic lyric register. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shift; even the slightly heightened diction feels anchored in her contemplative temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct perceptual signature (“collected other people’s discarded silences and replanted them inside herself”). Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate well, with longer, more baroque sentences suiting the quiet, ritualistic tempo. There is no head-hopping; even Elias’s entrance is framed through Mira’s sensory and emotional frame. A few metaphors cluster densely, but they feel intentional rather than uncontrolled.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with an imaginative lexicon (“fog curled into quotation marks,” “dawn the color of unread proofs”) that clearly belongs to a writer-character. Psychic distance is well modulated: we move smoothly between sensory immediacy and more reflective abstraction without losing track of the present scene. Dialogue, though sparse, is sharp and loaded—Lira’s single line and Mara’s spoken sentence to the boy carry subtext and stakes. The high lyricism occasionally flirts with over-density, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads like intentional texture rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon of ritual, machinery, and botany that feels particular to Elara’s worldview as a tinkerer-mystic. Rhythm and sentence length vary with the scene’s needs, sustaining a hushed, charged tone while allowing for moments of intensification at the transformation and release. The narrative distance is stable; we never head-hop or lose track of whose perceptions shape the images. Occasionally the diction leans toward abstract exposition, but not enough to break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person lyric voice is distinctive and consistent, with a strong rhythmic signature and metaphorical coherence tied to alchemy, cold, and sound. Diction and syntax feel unified with the character’s sensibility—ceremonial, careful, a bit archaic—without obvious register slips. The voice modulates subtly with pressure, tightening around the sealing ritual and warming in the closing recognition of the extra heartbeat. Some repeated constructions and key phrases push toward incantatory, but the pattern reads deliberate rather than as artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close-third voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphoric choices (“dusk’s bruise,” “brass guts jingling like distant cowbells heard through a fever”). Elevated diction feels plausible for a reflective craftsman-narrative stance and remains consistent. Rhythmic control is excellent: sentence lengths and cadences modulate to match contemplative investigation versus charged closure. There is no POV leakage or awkward explanatory intrusion; the narrative confidently trusts image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrically precise, and consistent, with metaphors (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush”) that feel of a piece with this world and mind. The third-person limited focalization stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the diction level is appropriate to a mythic, ritualized consciousness. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, supporting both the hushed atmosphere and moments of heightened pressure (e.g., around the sputtering burner and confession). The only mild constraint on a higher score is that the voice feels deliberately elevated but not yet astonishingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet grounded in Mara’s experiential lexicon (sawdust, ropes, rings), giving the piece a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm varies well, with longer, image-rich sentences balanced by occasional sharper lines that land emotional turns (“but death had better hearing”). POV remains stable and modest; the narration does not claim knowledge beyond Mara’s plausible inferences. The absence of dialogue is a strength here, keeping the focus on embodied perception and interior subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is strikingly consistent, with a dense but controlled lyricism that clearly belongs to this specific consciousness (“a blurred green dot smeared by time,” “ticket stubs… rustle like startled birds”). The surreal register and temporal slippage are taught early and sustained without head-hopping or stance confusion. Rare dialogue is well-chosen and distinct—the ghost’s line about replacing their future with other people’s endings crisply encapsulates the core conflict and feels age-appropriate in its accusation. Rhythm varies (long, image-rich sentences against short, declarative realizations), and the voice tightens effectively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrically technical, and consistent with a scientifically minded but imaginative focalizer; metaphors lean on engineering, astronomy, and hydraulics in a coherent way. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close to Alya’s perceptions while allowing compressed, patterned diction appropriate to a lyric short. Brief dialogue (Alya’s line, the architect’s subroutines) feels distinct and purposeful without breaking the established tone. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and rhythm modulates nicely between dense image and cleaner declarative lines.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person lyric voice is distinctive and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in clocks, weather, and quiet. Rhythm and diction are controlled; long, sensuous sentences fit the reflective mode and modulate nicely into the brief, plainer coda about apprentices and market bells. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narration feels plausibly aligned with Arlen’s sensibility despite its elevated lexicon. Occasional repetition of key phrases flirts with mannerism, but not enough to undercut the confident voice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in its war-and-water metaphors and attention to sound (“silence of morning radio,” “shipping forecast”). Diction and rhythm feel intentional and modulate well—calmer, expansive early; tighter and more charged around the coordinate and bunker. Riga’s scant dialogue is economical and in character, and the narrative never slips into unearned omniscience. The only slight restraint on a higher score is that at times the narrator’s register edges into a quasi-omniscient, essayistic loftiness that feels a hair above what Mara herself might think.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, rhythmically controlled, and convincingly tethered to Ari’s perception—nautical and botanical lexicons intertwine in a way that feels both character-true and aesthetically deliberate. The lyric density is pattern-taught from the opening sentence and modulates slightly as pressure rises, without head-hopping or stance confusion. Dialogue is sparse but effective, clearly distinguishing Ari’s grounded, metaphorical idiom from the harbormaster’s bureaucratic thinness. The third-person-limited distance remains stable and confident, allowing for poetic flourish without slipping into omniscient commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive: lyrical, metaphor-rich, yet coherent with the protagonist’s sensibility as a writer of vivid obituaries. Rhythm is well modulated, with longer, flowing sentences in reflection and slightly tighter phrasing around key turns (the thread pulsing, the younger self appearing, the planting of the last inch). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence and diction are consistent. A few abstractions repeat (“geography of healing,” “presence/absence”) enough to feel slightly over-signaled, but they don’t materially damage the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent: baroque, melancholic, and shot through with mechanical-organic imagery. Third-person focalization stays tightly aligned with the prince’s sensibility, with no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, modulating between long, ornate sentences and shorter emphatic beats at key turns (the crack of the egg, the chains snapping). The fairy-tale/lyric register justifies the elevated diction, so it reads as intentional style rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (fire/ash imagery, professional firefighter frames like “counting them like sprinkler heads in a burning hallway”). Psychic distance is steady, and time-slips into memory are smoothly cued by sensory triggers. Diction is elevated but plausibly fits a reflective, adult Mara in a quiet ritual, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few lines tread near authorial essay (“she wondered if every arsonist is just an Icarus…”) but do not break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled repetitions (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”) that support a coherent mood. Diction and imagery (“like perfume,” “liquid light,” “galaxy of her family’s abandonment”) feel of a piece and suit the slightly mythic mode. Psychic distance stays stable; we never head-hop, and the narration’s certainty matches what Mara can infer in this heightened reality. Occasional abstract formulations could be grounded with more embodied perception, but the perceptual signature remains distinct and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a clear, controlled lyrical texture—phrases like “slower than grief” and “approximating infinity in motion rather than measure” feel organic to this world and to Kael’s sensibility. Psychic distance is steady, and the narrative never claims knowledge beyond what Kael could plausibly apprehend in this speculative frame. Rhythm and diction modulate well around key beats (the anomalous echo, the gear/beacon union, the glowing petals) without sliding into formless purple haze or losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the carver’s contemplative temperament and the story’s spectral mood. Diction and syntax show deliberate rhythm, with recurring phrases (“thundering calm,” dinner poems) creating an incantatory effect consistent with the premise. POV control is clean—no head-hopping—and the omniscient-leaning access to village customs feels framed through her knowledge. At times, the lyric register risks monotony because emotional peaks sound similar to quieter moments, but overall voice control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with recurring lexical choices (“searing reverie,” “ethically diligent”) that feel like this specific mind. Diction stays consistent in register while allowing elevated metaphor that suits a lifelong caretaker of a quasi-sacred mechanism. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving from close sensory focus on metal and salt to broader reflection without losing track of the present action. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from dawn tension to dusk reverie reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, with phrases like “velveteen gloom” and “starlight drips” establishing a consistent, lush lyricism that matches Mercy’s interior world. Syntax and rhythm are well controlled, modulating between long, baroque sentences and tighter beats so the prose doesn’t become monotonous. The diction stays coherent—elevated but not implausible for the narrative stance—and the patterned metaphors teach the reader how to read this world. There’s a slight risk of over-richness, but the voice remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, controlled, and confidently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature—conceptual yet anchored in tactile and visual detail. The third-person lens stays stable and intimate, never head-hopping, and the occasional elevated diction fits the mythic, speculative register of the piece. Rhythm varies well, with long intricate sentences balanced by crisper, decisive ones at key turns (“She stepped off the spire’s edge, not falling but folding…”). At times the voice edges toward uniform rhapsody, which slightly flattens modulation, but it remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, consistent lyric texture—metaphors tied to music, dust, and censorship—that feels like a particular mind perceiving the world. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences varying in length to suit calm preparation versus the broadcast’s swelling climax. There is no head-hopping; even when inspectors appear, we perceive them strictly through Mila’s filtered lens. A few lines flirt with over-orchestration of metaphor, but the pattern is taught early and maintained with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person lyric voice is confident and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature in how it links physical process to memory and idea (powder as ash, mica, glitter, crystallized tears). Diction and rhythm are consistent with Elena’s artistic, grief-heightened consciousness and never drift into incongruous registers. Psychic distance is well managed, moving smoothly between immediate sensation and reflective association without confusion. The control under sustained lyric pressure is strong enough for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically dense but controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (sediment, gears, tides) that stays consistent under pressure. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction feels organic to a self-styled philosopher rather than imposed. The one line of dialogue at the end sounds like an extension of her interior rhetoric, appropriately heightened for a first public declaration. Occasional density of metaphor flirts with overrichness but does not compromise clarity or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Mara’s musical and pedagogical sensibility; diction like “frequencies anger forgets” and “traveled stillness” feels native to her way of thinking. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well, with long, braided sentences supporting incantatory sections and tighter lines around pivotal turns (offering her voice, the rosette crumbling). There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; the quasi-fabulist omniscience in the civic-scope lines still feels anchored in a single interpretive frame. The density of figurative phrasing is high but patterned and intentional, not accidental or mechanically repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, sensorially lush, and consistent, blending culinary, botanical, and neuroscientific lexicons into a distinctive texture. POV distance and access are stable, with descriptions filtered through Marisol’s way of knowing the world by taste and touch. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, allowing long, baroque sentences to sit alongside sharper beats like “She laughed, because even rebellion must be seasoned with self-knowledge.” The control under pressure and the coherence of the lyric voice would suit top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice around Mara is stable, confident, and lyrically distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature (industrial processes filtered through honey/bee/lightning metaphors). Diction is elevated but consistent with the fable-like mode and never strays into alien register for the character. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (Mara’s refusal, the boy’s ritual language) and advancing the plot. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence length modulating appropriately around the climactic lightning strike and aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature—phrases like “their sodium glow thinning against the dawn like memory against bone” feel native to this consciousness. POV is stable and controlled; the slight omniscient touches (streetlights “daydreaming”) read as expressions of Elara’s sensibility rather than head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively between dense image-clusters and clearer narrative progression. The voice is memorable and coherent enough to support this level of stylistic ambition without collapsing into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confidently controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—telepathic reception of nonhuman emotions, stone-bodied metaphors—that remains coherent under pressure. Diction and rhythm suit an ancient sentinel gaining consciousness, elevated but not academically sterile. Psychic distance is managed well; reflection is anchored in present stimuli (ampoule, arch, other statues waking). No head-hopping or stance drift appears, and the modulation from wonder to grave resolve at the arch is smooth and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses mathematical language, physical texture, and surreal imagery. Diction and rhythm stay consistent with Elara’s identity as a former mathematician without drifting into unnatural abstraction; phrases like “counted steps in prime numbers” and “heart ticking like a gear with a missing tooth” feel character-specific rather than generic-poetic. The lyric compression is taught from the outset and maintained through to closure, with no POV slippage or stance confusion. Occasional dense metaphor stacks push toward lushness but do not tip into opacity or undermine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is lush, confident, and distinctively Mira-colored, with sensory-driven metaphors that feel like the way an insomniac painter would think. Rhythm and syntax modulate well—long, ornate lines during trance-like painting, shorter, softer closures at dawn and with the tea. The few brief glances into Jules and the city are still clearly filtered through Mira’s perception or the established magical logic, so there’s no disruptive head-hopping. The lyric register is sustained without slipping into academic or therapy-speak, keeping the voice coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Aurelia’s sensibility as a cultured, historically oriented curator; diction and imagery match that persona. POV is stable and avoids head-hopping even when others speak, and the occasional dialogue lines are concise and subtextual. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, ornate sentences and shorter emphatic ones, particularly around the ending choices. At times the authorial/thematic register peeks through, but not so much as to break the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with patterned diction (“bleak exhilaration,” “latent radiance,” “counter clockwise”) that feels intentional rather than mechanical. The perceptual signature—obsessed with gears, time, and reversed motion—clearly reflects the maker’s mind, and the narrative distance holds steady even as time folds. There is no head-hopping or register drift; syntactic rhythm modulates nicely with pressure. The slightly elevated, mythic register may limit raw immediacy, but it suits the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—lush, gothic, slightly clinical from recent medical trauma—that remains stable under pressure. Diction like “resuscitation sirens,” “photographically cursed,” and “paradoxical notes” feels native to this narrator’s mind rather than imposed from outside. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay close to her perceptions while the advisor’s whispers and the dream dictionary add structured layers without head-hopping. Rhythmic control of sentences (long, baroque descriptive lines offset by shorter realizations) supports the build to and release from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinctive lexicon that fuses nautical, musical, and organic registers (“alto cumuli,” “restless euphony,” “fractal generating”). POV distance is stable—close enough to track the prophet’s interpretive frame, far enough to maintain mythic tone—and there is no head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax vary well, especially around peak beats (Doldrum reveal, second movement), where sentences tighten without losing texture. A slight risk is that the elevated diction sometimes prioritizes pattern over the prophet’s individual psychology, but it still reads as an intentional, unified narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (mixing cartographic, acoustic, and bodily metaphors). Patterned language (“sunwashed dread,” “quietly driven,” subsonic rumbles as communication) feels character-anchored rather than generic. Psychic distance remains stable; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly infer. A few abstract phrasings (“not alive, not dead, but something archived”) skim toward the conceptual, but they still fit her cartographer’s lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—clinical yet sensuous, befitting an “emotionally rational” historian. Diction and syntax are controlled, and interior commentary blends smoothly with external description without head-hopping. Occasional phrases (“emotionally rational eyes”) feel a touch conceptual, but they don’t break the spell. The one code-switch to “心跳” is noticeable yet still sits within a coherent narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and distinctly Mara’s, blending professional perception with haunted sensitivity (“diagnosed cracks with fingertips,” “a code of hollows she alone could read”). Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that suit the meditative descent and tighten subtly around key actions. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register jump, even when the diction becomes ornate. The elevated language slightly eclipses the sense of a working surveyor at times, but the quasi-fabulist frame mostly justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly attuned to systems, classification, and physical detail, fitting a “logical page indexer” without feeling clinical. Syntax and rhythm are varied, with well-controlled long, image-rich sentences balanced by shorter emphatic beats (“She extinguished the lantern.”). The narrative does not over-explain; it trusts images and Mara’s pattern-seeking mind to carry meaning, with phrases like “the more she felt the catalogue indexing her instead” giving the voice personality. A few abstract formulations (“hush of civilizations that had mistaken ink for immortality”) push toward a more essayistic register, but they remain in character and don’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, precise, and unmistakable—everything is filtered through a mind that understands light, lenses, and ritualized work. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, using long, baroque sentences that still parse cleanly and match the contemplative pressure of a pilgrimage. Diction (“oneiric engines,” “quota of sorrow,” “impossible paper, thin as grief yet stronger than justification”) feels organic to the world and to her craft-focused perception rather than like generic purple prose. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift even at peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinct, blending scientific lexicon (“perturbation theory,” “energy signatures,” “.003 degrees”) with visceral, grief-tinged imagery (“stardust that tasted like my wedding cake”). The psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both cool conceptualization and jagged emotion to coexist without slipping into authorial essaying. No POV leaks or register jolts appear, and the modulation from analytical to hallucinatory at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close on Mara is stable and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that matches the mystical-tech premise. Diction and rhythm are purposeful, and the pilgrim’s sparse dialogue and repeated descriptor (“perpetually surprised eyes”) give him a distinct flavor without crowding Mara’s focalization. There’s minor seepage into a more omniscient-sounding register at times, but it doesn’t confuse perspective or undercut emotional access. Overall, the voice feels unified and polished enough for high-level venues, even if it doesn’t yet feel radical or unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Elias-filtered, with a strong perceptual signature (time as something that can be “dismembered and sold,” wood that “knows when it’s lying”). The rhythmic control is good: long, lush sentences carry reflection, while sharper beats mark realizations and shifts. Dialogue is sparse but precise, and the mother’s single significant line carries layered subtext. The diction remains coherent with a reflective, educated, guilt-ridden narrator and doesn’t drift into alien registers.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a clear, poetic signature—“moon remembers tide,” “ink blooming like squid grief”—that feels consistent with Kael’s reflective, quasi-mystical temperament. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences modulating into sharper beats around key actions (raising his hand, casting the rope, giving up the pull). Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, revealing philosophy and resistance without exposition-dumping. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping; any omniscient-leaning descriptions stay plausibly within a lyrical, close-third frame.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent in its “merrily melancholic” sensibility, with inventive but controlled metaphors. Diction and rhythm feel like the mind of a poetic navigator, not a generic narrator, and the prose modulates well between dense image and cleaner action. There is no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion; even big thematic lines arise from her perceptions. A few clever turns (“Morse that spelled maybe, maybe”) flirt with self-consciousness but overall serve the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a consistent perceptual signature—surreal yet emotionally grounded metaphors, legal/justice-inflected images, and tight focus on the seeker’s psyche. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, with compression that suits the fable-like, speculative tone. Occasional generalizing sentences feel organic to this elevated narrative stance rather than like authorial intrusion. There is no POV slippage or unearned knowledge; the time-travel loop is revealed in a way that matches the narrator’s established omniscient-lyric distance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (culinary-spiritual imagery, familial intimacy, mythic registers) that remains stable under stress. Diction and rhythm are patterned but varied enough to avoid monotony, and psychic distance stays close without head-hopping. When abstractions appear, they are quickly re-grounded in image (“a drum naming her true name,” “crying notes that cracked the night open like a pomegranate”). No explanatory or “helpful narrator” intrusions undercut the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic tastes, temporal metaphors, porcelain and weather fused). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure: longer, incantatory sentences at peak visionary moments, slightly cleaner lines on landing and offering the tea. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and pattern-driven, teaching its own logic early and honoring it through closure. Minor slips (e.g., the repeated “unfasten” without “-ed”) read more like stylistic quirks than true POV or stance leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“drifted through the star-pocked silence,” “bruise in space”) that feels tied to Halcyon’s sensibility. Rhythm varies well, balancing long, baroque sentences with shorter emphatic ones like “She did not flinch.” POV distance remains stable and there’s no leakage or head-hopping. The voice modulates appropriately as pressure rises, becoming more incantatory without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with a clear lyrical signature that suits this mythic, accumulative mode. Third-person focalization stays stable through Kael while allowing a slightly elevated, fable-like diction that still feels coherent with his inner life. Patterned phrases (“whispering hush,” “texture of transformation”) contribute to a deliberate incantatory feel rather than accidental repetition. The risk is occasional uniform loftiness that flattens contrast, but it does not damage clarity or emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture—steampunk-poetic but still anchored in Garnet’s perceptions and lexicon. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and the few dialogue lines are sparse, purposeful, and in character. The narrative never head-hops and maintains a stable psychic distance, using images (“murdered torch bracket,” “sky-barges…like startled swans”) that feel like this world’s natural idiom. Under stress, the voice tightens around concrete tactics (pins, valves, relays) without abandoning its figurative flair, showing strong distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture, with metaphors and diction that feel consistent with the story’s mythic-scientific sensibility. There’s confident modulation from descriptive awe into more interior reflection without losing coherence. No dialogue is needed; the internal focalization maintains clear psychic distance and never leaks into unmotivated exposition. Patterned phrasing supports the ritualistic mood rather than reading as mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is strongly textured, with consistent metaphoric habits (cartography, photography, astronomy) that feel like Mara’s mind at work rather than generic lyricism. Rhythm modulates well—long, spiraling sentences for contemplative moments, shorter emphatic beats around lightning and the timer—so the prose breathes with the scene’s pressure. Diction is elevated but coherent with a poet-protagonist in a heightened, near-fabulist world; there’s no register drift or head-hopping. It stops short of absolute top-tier only because the density of figurative language occasionally risks sameness of register across the piece, even though it remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the elevated, intellectual milieu without tipping into academic abstraction. Elian’s perception—attuned to geometry, rhythm, and argument—gives the narration a distinct texture. Dialogue is clean, slightly stylized but fitting for scholars fencing with ideas, and it advances both plot and subtext. The psychic distance remains consistent, anchored in Elian while allowing brief, controlled glimpses of Vale through behavior rather than leaked interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—“flames bloom green, luminous fracture against iron”—that feels tuned to Lark’s poet consciousness without drifting into generic poetics. Dialogue is economical, character-distinct, and carries subtext (Marin’s “Can poems stop bulldozers?” folds skepticism, hope, and status-testing into one line). Psychic distance is handled deftly, zooming from tactile detail to future-leaning summary without confusion, and the mild future omniscience at the end reads intentional, as a broadened narrative stance after Lark’s shift. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, never obscuring what is actually happening.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture with inventive metaphors (“notes drift…like reluctant pigeons”; “strategically creative fingers”) that feel native to the piece. Focalization stays anchored to the pianist’s perception; even when the world grows surreal, the narration’s confidence doesn’t exceed what she could plausibly infer. Rhythmic control is good, with long, baroque sentences balanced by sharper, declarative turns at key beats (e.g., the decision to leave, the board reading “Onward”). The density of figurative language is high but pattern-consistent, so it reads as intentional style rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct lexicon (“empirically whimsical hush,” “luminous doubt”) that feels specific to this world and to Calyx’s role. POV distance is stable—tight third hovering just enough for worldbuilding while clearly anchored in Calyx’s perceptions. Rhythm and syntax are controlled despite the density; sentences modulate to suit pressure, and there’s no head-hopping or explanatory overreach. At times the high-register diction risks slight sameness across emotional beats, but it never becomes confusing or inert.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct sensibility (e.g., “glow the color of unspoken apologies, a hue no chart could name”) and stays consistent throughout. Kaede’s speech is sparse, measured, and tonally distinct from the narrator’s more elaborate interiority. Rhythm varies well between long, image-rich sentences and shorter, weighted lines, particularly around the instructions. A slight risk of uniform lushness remains, but it reads as intentional lyric mode rather than unfocused voice.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is authoritative and consistent, maintaining a "researcher" filter even during emotional beats. The transition from technical observation to philosophical insight feels natural to this specific focalizer. No head-hopping or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but overly intrusive, frequently interrupting the action to interpret the protagonist's feelings. The forced repetition of specific phrases ("steady adaptive," "drifting resonance") disrupts the narrative flow, creating a sense of artificiality in an otherwise distinct POV.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, though it occasionally borders on breathless. The shift from a scientific observation mode to a purely artistic/sentimental mode at the end causes a slight fracture in the established POV's reliability and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for a magical realist fable. However, the refrain "occupying impossible spaces" appears three times, feeling more like a repetitive scaffold than a deepening motif. The tone effectively balances the macabre with the serene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone. However, dialogue sometimes drifts into exposition ("My grandmother says the bell still remembers our real names"), performing themes rather than simulating natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly uniform; the dialogue is indistinguishable from the prose, creating a "ventriloquist effect" where all characters sound like the poet-narrator. The high-poetic register ("low green sunrise inside the dusk") distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, matching the magical realism genre perfectly. The narrative distance creates a fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift from technical description (hyperbolic geometry) to emotional interiority is handled smoothly without jarring register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the repetitive insertion of specific descriptor phrases ("patient strategic," "staggering grace") disrupts the narrative flow and feels like a mechanical checklist rather than natural description.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, suiting the fable-like quality. The synesthetic descriptions ("slow cello," "bruised note") effectively anchor the POV's unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone, but it relies heavily on repetitive adjectival phrasing. The distinction between the narrator and the character feels thin, as the narrative voice overwrites the character's internal experience with poetic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, blending the poetic descriptions with Mara's self-conscious, dramatized speech. The shift between the narrator's observations and Mara's spoken lines creates a layered texture that suits the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending noir-inflected industry jargon with an introspective tone. However, the voice wavers between gritty realism and fable-like wonder, creating a slight tonal inconsistency that mirrors the plot’s struggle between thriller and magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyric voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a high mythic register. However, the verbatim repetition of phrases like "mildly obsessed" disrupts the immersive quality, reading as a mechanical insertion rather than a voice-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately detached, fitting the robotic protagonist. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought sentimentality ("wind chimes made of memory") that feels more like authorial intrusion than the character's genuine perception.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct but occasionally overwrought, prioritizing poeticism over precision. Dialogue functions primarily as stiff exposition ("Her honesty is the key") that lacks naturalism or distinct character voice, flattening the interaction into a thematic lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyrical, slightly fable-like voice is consistent and suits the material well. There is a tendency toward filter verbs and summary ("She understood," "She realized") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific observation with lyrical introspection. The tone matches the "twilight" setting perfectly. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the world effectively through the mechanic's specific regrets and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from explanatory interiority that creates distance. The narrative frequently summarizes realizations ("He understood," "He realized") instead of allowing the reader to experience the character's shift.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)

    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably meditative, but relies on filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "understood") during the climax, which dampens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.9)

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, polished fairy-tale register that suits the material well.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from adjective-heavy density that distances the reader from the immediate action. The perspective feels filtered through a writerly scrim rather than embedding firmly in Mira's sensory experience, particularly during the summary of Elias's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the protagonist's writerly obsession. The "lucidly watchful" stance is maintained effectively, anchoring the surreal elements in a specific professional perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains a mythic distance that creates an emotional barrier. The tone is elevated and serious, which clashes with the "whimsical" character tag. The lack of dialogue or immediate interiority keeps the reader observing Elara rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable register that suits the material. It occasionally drifts into slightly melodramatic territory ("forge-joined lovers," "shattered silk"), but the distinct perceptual signature remains intact and controls the pacing well.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like distance that suits the material. However, the register is occasionally weighed down by an over-reliance on similes, creating a dense, slightly static texture.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly lyrical tone that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to the weaver's perception of the magic. There are moments of slight density ("whalebone reverie"), but the stylization generally works.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and consistently melancholic, fitting the protagonist. However, control is significantly undermined by the tense confusion noted in the prose category, which destabilizes the POV's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and melancholic, perfectly suiting the atmosphere. The POV control is tight, managing the surreal transition and the interaction with the self-ghost without confusion. The "we" moment during the reading of fragments is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive and elevated ("stanza in a grammar of reclamation"), creating distance. The hologram's voice blends indistinguishably with the narrator's poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. However, the mechanical repetition of specific multi-word phrases ("excruciatingly gentle," "petrichor nostalgia") disrupts the narrative distance, making the authorial hand visible and breaking the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the melancholic, myth-busting tone. The control of psychic distance is generally good, though the voice occasionally lapses into "writerly" intrusion to deliver the required phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric, fitting the "oceanic hush" tone well. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("brittle rosary of sky-fire"), and the breathless pacing of the climax blurs the physical action of the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and suited to the fable-like quality of the tale, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness. The narrative distance is controlled, but the tendency to summarize emotional states ("understood suddenly") rather than dramatize them keeps the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyrical, elevated voice suits the fable mode well, maintaining a consistent tone. However, it occasionally slips into abstraction ("frequency of forgiveness") that distances the reader from the physical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly "writerly," prioritizing poetic conceit over character-specific perception. The narrative distance feels calculated to deliver the theme rather than to inhabit Mara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical tone appropriate for the fable-like quality, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("sidereal patience of stars long dead"). The distance feels slightly too removed, observing Mara's emotions rather than fully inhabiting her immediate experience of the memories.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyrical, melancholic voice is consistent and suits the fable-like quality of the story. However, the reliance on repeated unique descriptors ("troubling serenity," "approximating infinity") creates a constrained feel that detracts from the voice's organic authority.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is disrupted by mechanical repetition of full character epithets and the phrase "spectral mentorship," which gives the prose a robotic, checklist-like quality. While the lyrical tone is consistent, the lack of varying sentence structures at key turns flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a distinct, melancholy precision that fits the winder's solitary, rhythmic life. The perspective remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the surreal elements through a disciplined, occupational worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the atmospheric content. The narrative distance is appropriate, though at times the "blithe" tone clashes slightly with the gravity of the refugee backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice suffers from significant register drift. The high-fantasy lyricism ("obsidian spire," "prophecy") clashes jarringly with corporate/technical terminology ("predictive modeling," "seed innovation," "groundedly imaginative"). This inconsistency breaks the narrative spell and distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the atmospheric, fable-like quality of the piece. The control over tone is consistent, maintaining a sense of "thistled calm" and reverence throughout. Narrative distance is managed well, keeping the reader close to Mila’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a somber, lyrical tone appropriate for the subject. However, the voice often slips into melodrama ("assembling from bathroom tiles and grief") and self-conscious profundity, occasionally prioritizing poetic effect over clarity or emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and elevated, suiting the "philosopher" persona with a rhythmic, slightly archaic tone. It falters only when incorporating the required "rationally rebellious" attribute, which feels modern and clinical against the gothic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and hushed, matching the "velvet" atmosphere. The narrative distance is appropriate for a fable, though it occasionally dips into slightly breathless metaphorical density that draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and magical realist tone. While confident, the narrative distance is stable, and the prose texture effectively supports the fable-like quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and attuned to the fable-like quality of the story. However, the phrase "involuntarily truthful stare" is slightly clumsy and abstract compared to the concrete imagery elsewhere. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mara’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable-like tone. It maintains control over the magical realism elements without slipping into exposition, though the high-lyric mode is relentless.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is exceptionally distinct—elevated, lyrical, and consistent with the persona of an ancient stone sentinel. The perceptual signature is unique ("taste the grief of barnacles"), maintaining high control over the first-person perspective without slipping into generic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice successfully balances the analytical detachment of a mathematician with the sensory desperation of the crisis. The register shift during the descent—"velvet-heavy," "almost rain"—matches the character's internal dissolution without breaking consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, fitting the magical realism genre well. The narrative distance is stable, though the relentless poeticism occasionally prioritizes sound over immediate physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice leans too heavily on abstract adjectives to define the protagonist ("cultured," "historically oriented") instead of revealing these traits through action. The tone is consistent but occasionally drifts into forced sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. However, the excessive repetition of specific phrases (lexical loops) detracts from the immersive hold of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a high-gothic, noir-tinged register that suits the surreal content. The integration of the required elements into this voice is mostly smooth, though "unbosom" stands out as slightly archaic against the rest of the diction.

    The voice is confident and lyrically consistent, maintaining a mythic tone that supports the magical realism. The POV remains tightly anchored to the prophet’s auditory perception, filtering all description through his unique lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, reflecting the protagonist’s scholarly background with precise, atmospheric diction. The flow is only interrupted by the awkward insertion of the prompt phrase "emotionally rational," which jars against the otherwise smooth prose.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, suited to the setting. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("boots kissing the wet marble," "censers that had forgotten their prayers") that feels slightly over-adorned for the otherwise stoic focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somewhat formal, lyrical tone that suits the setting of an antique, sunken library. Interiority is well-managed, shifting smoothly from technical observation to philosophical realization without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently tuned to the character's melancholic desperation. The integration of technical jargon feels natural to the character's worldview, maintaining a stable POV throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but marred by repetitive phrasing and high-register ornamentation that feels manufactured. The repetition of character tags ("perpetually surprised") distracts from the narrative flow, and the dialogue leans into expository functionality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical ("genealogist of ghosts"), establishing a strong mood. However, the narrative authority is undercut by the confusion regarding the ancestor's identity ("her grandfather" vs. "her father").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, fitting the mythic/fable quality of the narrative. The elevation is maintained well, though it occasionally risks distancing the reader from the visceral reality of the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent and confident, maintaining a heightened, lyrical register that suits the fable-like structure without breaking character. The rhythm of the prose supports the mythic quality, though the shift to a future-tense summary at the end creates a slight distancing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and detached ("exhaling secrets"), creating a fable-like distance that limits emotional engagement. Dialogue is stiff and performative, reading like written philosophy rather than spoken speech.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the high-fantasy steampunk aesthetic. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought "purple" description ("lover’s exhale," "murdered torch bracket") that draws attention away from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and slightly elevated tone that suits the magical realism genre ("borrowed dawn," "geometry of absence"). The prose creates a cohesive mood, though the heavy reliance on adjectives occasionally slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a "fantasy academia" tone that suits the subject matter. The prose controls the pacing well, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into aphorism ("I stitch time") which threatens naturalism, but fits the established stylized reality.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the "penny poet" persona. The transition between the gritty reality of the prison guard and the surrealism of the molting is handled smoothly. A minor critique is that the dialogue sometimes feels too composed for the high-stakes situation, lacking the jagged edges of genuine fear.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, perfectly suiting the protagonist. While effective, the narrative distance remains slightly high, observing the surrealism rather than always inhabiting the visceral panic of the choice.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is neutron-star precise: “molecular accretion, layer upon layer” mirrors syntactic accretion. Register never drifts into academic waffle; even “PSR J1748-2446ad” is earned. Perceptual signature is color-obsessed—cobalt, galvanized, rust—filtering every object through photonic vocabulary. One micro-loop: “humidity still clung… clung” in adjacent clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: participle openers, hyphenated compounds, and sonic repetition (“drifting resonance,” “blank gather”) serve the glass-blower’s perceptual ear. Syntax breathes with scene tempo—short clauses under stars, longer sinuous sentences at dawn. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly within her sensory frame.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter—she notices glass dust, not architecture trivia. Syntax lengthens during the crescendo of forks, then shortens as battery dies, mirroring musical phrasing. No head-hopping or register drift; scientific terms (watertight, calibrating) remain within her professional lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is a hushed, mortuary cadence—“eyes of the many dead he had dressed for viewing”—that modulates to phosphorescent lyricism under water.

Compression like “chased stillness” is taught early and paid off in the final column of hush.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays anchored to Mara’s sensorium; no head-hop into boy or Lita. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadence for cart rolls, staccato for clicks.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: scent is “drinkable,” colors separate into “layers of withheld tenderness.” Breath rhythm governs syntax, mirroring shared inhale/exhale without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized; perceptual signature is botanical-photographic—emulsions, celluloid rings, sap-drip—never generic.

    Third-person lyric close-third stays strictly within her perceptual signature: “bruised violets and slow gold” is painterly chromatic bias. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadences for ascent, clipped fragments at mirror confrontations. Patterned diction (rain-split light, heartbeat-flutter) taught early and paid off in bell-pigment shower. No head-hopping; unreliability never asserted. Syntax mirrors her grace: enjambed clauses flow like brushstrokes, then crack into diagonal fragments at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV maintains steady psychic distance yet filters every perception through the philanthropist’s selective bias: he notices scholarships and hospital wings as laundering devices, ignores farmers. Syntax grows clipped under static charge—“He knelt…pressed…traced”—then lengthens for constellation projection, mirroring breath release. No head-hop; “secretly sentimental” stays inference from action, not authorial label. Final cadence—“every step…like grace refracted”—achieves Charged Poise without voice rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline and synesthetic—“veins of silver running through alabaster that mapped the human heart in anatomical verse”—consistent with Lys’s trained attention to bodies.

    First-person voice sustains a rhythmic, chant-like cadence that mirrors organ-card perforations—short clauses, em-dashes, colon breaks—taught by sentence 1 and paid off in the dissolving final line. Perceptual signature is concrete and idiosyncratic: “coppery ghost of old blood,” “scalloped by boot heels.” No head-hopping; lexicon stays within a caster–archivist’s diction. Compression under aurora flare heightens rather than obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person limited sustains consistent perceptual signature: narrator notices textures of rust, chlorophyll, circuitry in poetic compression.

No dialogue; voice coherence judged on narrative texture alone.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is irreducibly specific: “brightened disquiet,” “existential steam,” “nonlinear inheritance”——diction that could only belong to this archivist-poet narrator. Rhythmic control under pressure compresses into staccato revelations (“Time folded like origami”) then exhales into lullaby cadence at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored in Mara’s professional gaze (cataloging, grafting, indexing).

    Perceptual signature is dense, synesthetic, linguistically obsessive—perfect for an arcane linguist. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for descent, staccato when time hiccups. Non-standard grammar (“staff line,” “comma slicing his wrist”) is pattern-taught early and pays off. No head-hopping; traveler’s POV is externalized through Elara’s gaze, keeping focalization pure. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“chronometer,” “solanum”) fits her vocation yet risks register drift in one beat, not enough to cap.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lush yet precise, syntax stretching like calliope breath: “breathing for two, finally buoyant.” Perceptual signature is fused—soprano-alto coat, left/right stride argument—never head-hops.

Rhythm compresses under pressure: “loosening the left strand, crossing the right over absence itself” mimics braid cadence. No head-hop; janitor’s diary is filtered through her skepticism. Wax-and-hemp metaphor chain stays consistent, teaching its pattern by midpoint and paying off in the crimson script that sinks back into fiber.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: gravity tugging hair upward, silence tasting of iron or honey, trellis warming “xenial”—all filtered through a bunker child’s hyper-tactile attention.

No head-hopping; lyric elision is taught early and paid off in the final peeled-gold image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)

Dialogue absent by design, voice distinction N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)

Syntax mirrors breath-shortage: em-dash halts, clause-stacking mimics lung-cram. No head-hopping; keeper’s perceptual signature—every external detail filtered through skin-weight and lung-pressure—remains coherent. Dialogue minimal, stylized, goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is hallucinated-grit: "quantum promise like neon scripture," "barometric scars"—diction stays inside scam-survivor perceptual signature. Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-word texts, staccato choir—then exhales into lullaby cadence at close. No head-hopping; glitch-texts remain external, preserving distance. Experimental elision ("u still owe u") is pattern-taught early and paid off in calm signal darkening.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)

No head-hopping; the camera never leaves the knight’s sensorium. The elevated diction is earned by the fairy-tale register and never drifts into academic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyric third-person POV sustains a controlled, antiquarian diction (“infantryman’s insignia,” “camel-hair brush”) that feels native to an archivist who names artifacts for a living.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is a sustained saxophone solo in prose: reed-breath syntax, flutter-tongue fragments, micro-tonal punctuation. Perceptual signature never wavers—every noticed detail is pitch, vibration, or echo. The risky compression (“a snake devouring its own tail made of breath and brass”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the erasure beat.

No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in Elias’s sensory filter.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline: “iron-smelling dark,” “mercury syllables,” “charcoal heart” all issue from an alchemist’s sensory hierarchy. Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-clause furnace beats—then elongates at closure, mirroring the beam leveling. No head-hopping; even the brother’s voice arrives as equation, not ventriloquism. One micro-drift: “factual-mystical” sounds like prompt residue, but the phrase appears once and is immediately enfleshed by coin-warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is ferociously specific: “ultraviolet sap print its bruise-colored fingerprints across my skin” fuses science, shame, and tactility in one clause. Syntax mirrors neural overload—long, hyphen-stitched sentences fracture into staccato datum-counting. No head-hop; first-person singular stays locked inside altered nerves. The unreliable calibration (“laughter was the only decimal place left”) is signaled early and paid off as the final hiccup of light.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: tide-gnawed ruins, beam-song, copper-salt air.

No head-hopping; diction stays within the lighthouse-keeper’s child lexicon without drifting into catalogue prose.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)

Purposeful repetition (“mending what isn’t torn”) teaches motif and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lyric-accumulative voice sustains rhythmic control—variable sentence lengths mimic breath-pressure descending the spiral. Diction stays within Ivy’s eccentric collector lexicon (“vials,” “psychometry,” “fossil confetti”) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric hovers close to Liora’s perceptual skew—synesthetic, painterly, cathedral-obsessed. Rhythm swells and contracts with seasonal cadence; sentence length mirrors thaw/freeze cycles. No head-hopping; distance stable.

    Voice is oceanic and forensic at once—“liquid night under day,” “grammar of shells and drift-bone”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Compression is taught early (“retrocognitively trapped”) and paid off in the final “searing reverie.” No head-hopping; single POV stays locked to Mireya’s perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person alchemical voice owns a mineral, smoky diction—“phosphor ink,” “retort of attention,” “lantern skin”—that stays within a plausible apothecary lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses shorten during lantern ignition, then lengthen for the dawn walk, mirroring respiratory cadence. No dialogue, so naturalism gauges are waived; the internal monologue to the bottle carries subtextual negotiation rather than exposition. Psychic distance tightens from reflective notebook cuts to immediate ash-smeared fingers without unmotivated filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized; perceptual signature is gardener-specific—starlight as second moon, seeds as constellations.

Diction remains within plausible lexicon for a solitary maintenance man who inherited grandmother’s myths.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)

Lexicon stays within recluse-beekeeper idiom—smoke, soot, super, comb—no academic drift. Perceptual signature is color-fractured (violet/emerald shards) and weight-oriented (parchment heavier than stone), consistent and character-specific. Purposeful elision (“mute eloquence”) is taught early and paid off when spoken words physically seal fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to the timekeeper’s perceptual filter—cracked glaze = cracked hourglass, iron-taste of light.

Rhythm modulates with pressure: low voice to sand, torn strip tuning, final erased sentence—each cadence matches emotional crest.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is crystalline, skeptical, and scientifically compressed: “she believed the offworlders had lied—not out of malice, but nostalgia.” Perceptual signature is chemist-biased—she smells cyanotype rinse and iron from a paper cut, not “mother.” Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer clauses for moss-earth, staccato for spiral climb, then hush in the dome. No dialogue needed; interior diction never drifts into therapeutic self-labeling. The final sentence—“the reaction had begun”—is a perfect Charged Poise cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is singular, compressed, mythic: “narrow vastness,” “flower-drunk sand,” “drowned trumpet” create a perceptual signature that could belong to no other narrator. Patterned elision—absence of articles, stacked noun phrases—is taught by line 2 and held to the final “begin.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long litany of extinct species accelerates breath, then final sentence slows to match patient vegetal conquest. No dialogue, so interior texture must carry all subtext; dead languages function as inner speech that bleeds outward.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays bloodhound-close: every noticed scent is职业-specific, every color filtered through canine dusk-vision. Syntax stretches—”the wild hush that follows artillery”—yet remains within a hound’s temporal sense. No head-hopping; Kite’s interior enters only via gesture observable to nose/eye.

Diction (“cautious abandon,” “torn moonlight”) is consistent, rhythmic, and aphoristic; syntax modulates under pressure (fragmented during collapse, elongated during ascent). Filter verbs minimal; perception skewed through Vespers’ wonder-biased lens. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“Sky’s still wrong” / “Good” encodes generational succession); no convergence of voices at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-limited stays latched to Mara’s crisis-perceiver lens: sentences compress under threat ("stone mouths shaping vowels of air") and elongate during walking spells.

Syntax mirrors gait—heel-toe-pause-toe-heel fragments are legible as code. No head-hopping; Kestrel’s interiority is inferred only through Mara’s perception of his cracked voice, maintaining modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax is controlled—compression during storm-light study, elongation during labyrinth walk—without algorithmic pattern. Diction stays within a tutor’s lexicon; no register drift. The single line of “fierce repose” is reused twice, but the reprise is intentional, not template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax tightens under pressure—“She spoke over the echo, voice innocently mischievous”—then fractures into choral repetition. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“Bone towers flanked the path ahead, their hollow sockets humming…”) is taught early and paid off when the sockets later spit her lines rear-ranged.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice carries a distinct alchemical cadence—compressed, metallic, ritual—without losing clarity; perceptual signature is consistent (“acid sea kissed the iron”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses credibly under the thirteen-second breath cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close clings to Ren’s perceptual syntax: salt as memory, gulls as circular saws, keys for people who plan return. Rhythm modulates: long chloride breaths of sentence open with “The mirror cracked…” then collapse to postcard clauses under cave fatigue. No head-hop; distance stable. Filter verbs (“he understood”) appear once but serve psychic shift. Near 9.0 but diction occasionally over-elevates (“cathedral veins,” “conceptual cost”) a hair above painter’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a perfumed, salt-tinged diction that is unmistakably singular. Rhythm modulates with climb-descent-climb structure, mirroring heartbeat beacon. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person voice carries a precise perceptual signature: truffle as “spongy flesh,” storms “tasted of other people’s regrets,” textbook “smelled of mildewed hope.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“film rose…like curious children”—then widens for ridge reflection, showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction stays within plausible post-virus forager lexicon; no register drift. Experimental elision (floating eye, voice from storm) is pattern-taught by orchard surrealism and paid off by implant, keeping closure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close keeps to Elias’s perceptual signature: margins, symbols, antique textures. Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for dust-laden nostalgia, tighter fragments when the chip glows. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within a map-dealer’s lexicon; the single lyrical surge at the bioluminescent reveal is earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors synesthetic fusion (“air thinned into lace,” “tasting iron, tasting endings”).

Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence held through lyric narration without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrative voice is scientifically romantic—oxytocin milligrams beside caramel-stretch time—without register drift. Perceptual signature is Corin’s: spirals as mathematics, starfire as commerce, shadows as ribbons.

No head-hop; Mira’s interiority is accessed only through Corin’s interpretation of her touch and tear-salt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains disciplined psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp—tea-dark lake, squid-ink with jade, bergamot-cedar exhale. Syntax coils like breath held, then releases in shorter cadences when the rune seals. No head-hopping; the one-line teacher dialogue is functional, not voice-contaminated.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice owns a perfomer’s synesthetic lexicon—slow arpeggios of dust, microtonal lament in wiring—sustained across compression and lyric elision. Diction stays inside musician’s idiom; no register drift even at peak. Perceptual signature distinct: she feels electricity as musical intervals, apology as rosin on tongue. Rhythm modulates with stress—short pizzicato whispers from ghost against long legato of her apology.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is irreducibly lyric—compressed, patterned, cosmically dextrous—yet never loses immediacy; perceptual signature is consistent (“tasted of starlight and dust,” “quiet rotation”).

Free-indirect compression (“he understood that…”) is brief and warranted by escalating awe.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person stays tight to Maya’s spatial perception; diction (“nested topographies,” “stipe”) fits her professional lens. Rhythm accelerates with staccato clicks and heartbeats under peak stress, then exhales into longer cadence at dawn. No head-hopping; Dr Voss’s dialogue is utilitarian, distinct from Maya’s interior lyricism. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she perceived the cavern’s hidden vector”).

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close lingers inside Mira’s perceptual quirks—numbers as prayers, scents as mood maps—without head-hop. Syntax grows leaner under pressure: “She stood, eyes open, and waited” after long, image-rich prior clause, mirroring subway alertness. Free indirect style clean: “or so she told herself” filters misbelief naturally. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a; internal diction stays within mathematically-tuned humanities student register—no sudden academic overload.

    First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: sonic metaphors (“tasted like rusted rain”), synesthetic crossings, and a cadence that mimics the disc’s circular spin. Syntax compresses under pressure—“I almost did—then remembered”—without losing clarity. No filter-verb clusters; every sensation is embodied. Dialogue from the child is sparse, indirect, age-appropriate, and carries subtext (“Teach me how endings begin”) that advances the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly bound to archivist’s perceptual filter: walnut ink = bruised violets, gulls = ghost-children.

Filter verbs (“she thought”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Distinct cadence differentiates security guard’s spoken plainness.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited hugs Kit’s desperately jocular register—syntax snaps with comic timing yet can pivot to lyricism ("silence would catalyze memories").

No head-hopping; narratorial knowledge stays inside what Kit can see or infer.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyric third-person saturates every clause: syntax elongates then contracts mimicking spiral walk; diction stays within poetic yet blind-professional lexicon. Perceptual signature is relentless—sound-as-taste, wrist-Braille—never lapses into generic narrator. Patterned repetition (“musical notes… notes pressing”) is taught early and paid off in new melody he composes by walking. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Risk elevates coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is irreducibly Mira’s: meteoric iridium, “poetic glyphs,” “contingency as ink” — lexicon filtered through celestial interpreter training. Rhythm compresses under pressure—clause-stacking lines mimic gravitational shear, then breathe at “warmth rising through the soles of her boots.” Perceptual signature stable: she notices gravitational tug in bones, hears pulsar beats inside child-laughter, sees spider-silk filaments. No head-hop; free indirect style stays anchored to her emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient, pitched like a folktune: syntax lengthens and contracts with tidal rhythm, diction salted with nautical exactitude (“capstan,” “cleat,” “sheet-music water”).

Compression (“glissando of knuckles”) is taught early and paid off in slowed lull.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Narrative diction stays within Mira’s vocational ear—“mechanical rhythms,” “corrugated corridors,” “metal canyon”—creating a perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for mapping vigilance, clipped fragments when key turns. No head-hopping; interior access remains steady. Occasional elevated phrasing (“crystallized final moment”) drifts above hard-hat lexis but remains isolated.

Voice is singular, oceanic, unreadable to bargemen—exactly the point.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at Mara’s shoulder, filtering every perception through her wind-hearing bias. Syntax mimics chess-clock tension: “She closed the library, pocketed the grotto, stepped into the method…” No head-hop; collective “they” at the end preserves focalization. Diction stays within a night-wandering coach’s lexicon—no academic register creep. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Ellis’s “voice barely dust on the air” vs. cashier’s coin-stacking brevity.

Rosa’s voice is rough-breathed, furnace-scarred; her silence behind the welding mask carries subtext. No head-hopping; focalization remains anchored to Milo’s sensorium until the final we-stance. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for chromatic overload, staccato shards for deliberate smashing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: narrator hears world as frequencies, shadows as “golden,” silence as tactile—vocabulary rooted in sonic obsession. Syntax lengthens during song, fragments during dismantling, mirroring emotional swell; no head-hopping. Compression (“propelling itself across the room”) is taught early and remains legible. Dialogue sparse but textured: “Why do we mourn the silence?” carries subtext of challenge, not query.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to jeweler’s tactile attention; perceptual signature favors weight, scent, fold. Syntax stretches in long anaphoric clauses that mirror ritual repetition, then contracts at dissolution: “She gathered her tools.” No dialogue, so voice purity maintained.

Free indirect slips stay inside the guides’ shared liminal perspective; diction remains within ferry-folk idiom.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings diversify; however, several soft scaffold phrases (“as if the land itself had become lost,” “like breath on cold glass”) repeat concept without new pressure.

Minor rhythm echo in repeated “question”-prefaced clauses is intentional, pattern-taught early and paid off in closing line.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is tracker-specific (“pink eyes narrowing,” “desert’s language”). Syntax lengthens under temporal stretch, mirroring theme.

Perceptual signature is character-specific—railway lexicon (“rolling stock,” “timber sleeper”) filters every perception. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Under stress diction compresses—“pulse rattling”—without losing clarity. One hairline slip: “wistfully necessary” drifts toward elevated register, but rhythm elsewhere remains steel-on-steel precise.

No head-hopping; third-person stays locked to Lila’s sensory filter. Diction never exceeds her lexicon (“raw solace of an unmedicated sky”) yet lifts into lyric register without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric, omniscient-adjacent voice sustains hypnotic cadence; diction (“propagation delay,” “phosphorescent tiles”) stays within dreamer’s arcane lexicon. Perceptual signature selective: notices lies, heartbeat floors, cipher light. Rhythm accelerates toward final scream without head-hopping. No dialogue to distort.

Lyric compression (“salt and regret”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter—silvering hair toward childhood, voice pitching up—then widens to Marcus’s stunned comprehension. Rhythm modulates from incantatory listing of rings to the hushed single sentence of her disappearance. No head-hop, no filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)

Syntax mirrors fatigue: long clauses, then fragment—“Failure, however, was a credential…” Rhythm accelerates during stair collapse, breathes on snow island. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Diction within POV lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice distinct, stable, and modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Jin’s synesthetic perception; diction (“copper echo,” “velvet hush,” “star-smoke”) is consistent and character-bound.

Rhythmic control compresses under pressure—“Memory slammed into him like chapel bells”—then elongates in the ash-settling cadence. No head-hop; diction stays within an ancient death-agent’s register. One elision—“words were for the living”—is taught and paid off when he can only click his jaw.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—time measured in drip-count, sea remembered as taste of iron. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives under viaduct, longer breathy lines during years-passing montage. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; internal monologue stays within lukewarm-mage lexicon (“he had studied dripping rates”). Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Final epitaph line adopts incantatory cadence that echoes opening.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marisol’s perceptual signature—she notices tools of rescue and trespass first, emotional color second. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as she steps through the broken window, then lengthen in the starlit calm. No head-hopping; the mayor, mother, father are filtered through her sudden re-appraisal. The only micro-slip is “mirrored hush inside her chest,” a brief drift into poetic abstractions that momentarily lifts out of her lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains stable focalization; perceptual signature is alchemist-specific—vials clink, mica flashes, prime numbers sung to a starling.

Patterned elision (“the hush before creation”) is taught early and paid off in the final transparent flame.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakably canopy-trained: “leaf and wind rhythm,” “moonlit canopy,” “cloud sea.” Syntax mirrors altitude breathing—long accumulative clauses that suddenly snap shut like a buckle (“the snap reverberating through both futures”). No head-hopping; older self remains a mirrored surface, voice intact. Compression such as “soundless echo” is pattern-taught early and paid off in final peace, proving lyric elision can be both musical and causal.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric-lean, compressive, patterned: “history rewrote itself for the seventh time that week” teaches the cadence early. Metaphors stay sensory-anchored (“pale jellyfish,” “struck crystal”) without purple drift. Syntax modulates: short declaratives under blade tension, longer coils during memory pours. No head-hop; focalization glides from Mara → Zero → merged observer without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at calibrated psychic distance: we get “pulse matched the distant storm” but not omniscient exposition. Syntax grows clausal under pressure—“roots erupted outward, not downward, threading between floorboards”—then tightens at dawn lock. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is architect-inventor: every sensation is angle, gear, duct. Dialogue-free design is a valid stylistic choice; voice remains distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric pulses with Ellery’s perceptual signature—sound as marble, dust in lungs, concrete ribs. Syntax mirrors grief: long breathy clauses collapse into fragmentary whispers at throttle-drop. No filter-verb clutter; “macerated itself against his ribs” is embodied, not explanatory. Pattern of compressed elision (“the house forgot how to laugh”) is taught early and paid off in the final exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyric, syntactically varied, and fur-filtered: “breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas” is perception-specific, never generic. Compression taught early (“dimensionally homesick”) is paid off in final fur-as-boundary image. No head-hopping; POV remains inside the guardian’s flickering between beast and librarian memory. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long accumulative clauses build, then break into the decisive “She did not cross.”

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is dense, alchemical, rhythmically controlled—“penny-drops rhythm against ruined ribs.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through soot, goggles, frost.

No head-hopping; distance stays tight inside Mira’s hearing-aid filter.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyric-technical, compressing spelunker jargon with submarine poetry: “throat of stone,” “crash of surf she could not see.” Perceptual signature is claustrophobic narrow-focus—light cones, glass scraping skin, the single flake winking—never touristic panorama. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as tunnel narrows, then relax into longer ebb-tide rhythm on the deck. No head-hopping; even Voss’s whisper is filtered through Mara’s perception, maintaining strict interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice is relentless, compressed, cyber-poetic: “I learned to ride the Wi-Fi like wind” teaches the pattern early and pays off when he surfs ink-fractals into meat. Diction stays within a coder’s lexicon without slipping into brand catalog. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“Heartbeat 97,998… 98,001”—creating propulsion that mirrors defrag progress. One micro-cheat: “galaxies of spilled midnight” edges toward purple, but the narrator’s observatory context licenses cosmic scale. The perceptual signature—mechanical tick equals pulse—remains consistent and singular.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is copper-veined: syntax glints like metal, rhythm pulses in filament cadences. Perceptual signature filters every noun through tactile texture—mud-slip, knapped-flint sorrow—never tourist catalog.

Patterned inversion acts as rhythmic motif, taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature is relentless lyricism—“misting hush,” “chime of wind bells,” “whispering gleam”—yet every neologism is taught early and paid off at closure. Compression (“a lullaby of almost”) is patterned, not decorative, and remains legible under causal lens. Syntax mirrors emotional arc: clauses lengthen during memory-song, then fracture into single-note sentences as halo dissolves. No head-hopping; single POV maintains consistent psychic distance even during impossible sensory events.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice carries mathematician-librarian perceptual signature: equations that rhyme, verses that calculate; syntax stays curled, recursive, mirroring hyperbolic cadence. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction remains consistent: “metrical lullabies,” “topological pressure.” Filter verbs serve voice (“she understood now why…”) rather than dulling immediacy. Compression taught early (“179 degrees, then 181, then beyond what Euclid would allow”) and paid off at closure; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“shard-mirror archivist,” “three o’clock sliced out”) and paid off in the honey-slide of freed light. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lira notices cracks, geometry, dust, never generic “books.” Reverse motion demands syntactic inversion that never loses clarity. Non-standard grammar is purposeful (“annotating cracks in reality the way others catalogued books”) and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyric omniscient voice sustains radiant hush diction with rhythmic control; perceptual signature is color-saturated and orchard-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person stays close to Elian’s tactile bias; syntax lengthens during knot work then shortens at release, mirroring breath. Perceptual signature is consistent—“interlaced hush,” “salt and old songs” idiom belongs to a restorer who tastes materials. No filter-verb stacks; moonlight “threaded” is the only figurative risk and it pays off immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntactic parallelism (“petals…petals…petals”) teaches pattern early and pays off in fireworks of release.

    Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature: “inconvenient curiosity,” “affectionately detached,” “stored the sound like a bulb in her chest.” Syntax bends to her rising wonder—clause-length swells then fragments as elevator lamps flicker. No head-hop; diction never exceeds a parlour-maid’s plausible lexicon yet achieves lyric lift.</answer>
    <question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the elevator’s motion: long ascent sentences compress into staccato discoveries (“UNFOLD—repeating like breath”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence carries dual weight (e.g., “snow…settled on the captain’s encrypted diary like a soft apology” advances both atmosphere and plot). Figurative language is patterned early (frost-lensed heartbeat) and paid off in the seed’s optimistic punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable—Mara tastes regret as “burnt coffee and airport goodbyes,” a lexicon no other narrator could own. Rhythm modulates from long, cradle-like sentences to staccato log entries that mimic filament ridges. Free-indirect compression (“quietly explosive, a filament bulb about to shatter with feeling”) stays within her scientist-poet diction. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; even the second-person “you” in her whisper is anchored in apostrophe to the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to her haptic, face-blind sensorium; no filter verbs intrude. Syntax lengthens during fractal painting, then fractures into staccato beats as sirens sound, mirroring pulse. Diction remains within her perceptual lexicon—“whisper of cadmium,” “sky-shaped absence”—never drifting into curator-speak. The only bar to 9+ is one clause (“fractally precise strokes, each eyelash rendered in mathematical succession”) that edges toward technical display rather than felt process.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays inside Lira’s perceptual filter—starlings as uncharted currents, dust as half-erased syllables. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under urgency (“She sprinted”). No head-hopping; Captain Rooth’s interior is guessed, not ventriloquized. Distinct diction: “stranded luminance,” “polyglot’s phrasebook dog-ear”—precise, never purple.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited sustains lunar-locksmith perceptual signature—mechanical metaphors, tool-based attention, eclipse lexicon. Prose rhythm modulates from languid opening cadence to clipped micro-choices under pressure ("He uncapped...spill...held"). No dialogue = no penalty; free indirect cleanly handles interiority. Occasional elevated diction ("driftwood nostalgia," "conceptual repricing") stays within obsessed artisan lexicon; pattern taught early. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical, pressure-matched cadence: long breathy sentences for drift, staccato for clang.

Dialogue absent by design; voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)

Syntax compresses under pressure (“Time thinned; frost began to lace…”) then elongates for the final vista. Diction stays within her rustic lexicon; no academic register drift. Patterned repetition of “she moved…she pressed…she spat” teaches the ritual cadence and pays off in the final fossil moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is chemically precise: “fossilized moonlight,” “concert pitch,” “translucent fingernail”—diction stays within a polymer chemist’s sensory lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long alliterative sweeps during contemplative beats contract to clipped fragments (“She climbed. Knees trembling.”) under physical strain. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unchallenged. Filter verbs are sparing and voice-motivated; the one tiny template echo (“braided, split, and re-braided”) is pattern-taught and therefore waived.</answer>
    <question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Sentence-level propulsion is relentless: every line either advances material science (“foam-templated resin stirred until the mixture sang at 440 hertz”) or deepens emotional stakes. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“river foam patterns that braided, split, and re-braided like polymer chains”—the physical logic holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image is fresh yet tethered to polymer vocabulary. Read-aloud cadence crests at the crescendo paragraph, mirroring the symphonic payoff without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays stable, filtering every perception through the vendor’s perceptual signature of absence-measurement: she “incises the day,” “lets hours bleed in measurable drops,” and finally becomes measurable absence. Diction—“parole word,” “algorithm of absence,” “conceptual repricing”—remains within the narrator’s invented lexicon, never drifting into explain-y register. Rhythm modulates: languid opening sentences mirror cloud-float, then tighten into clipped transactional exchanges, accelerating to the final shard-like cadence of scattered letters. No head-hopping; even the librarian’s stagger is observed externally, maintaining distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.4)

Register remains within a chef’s lexicon; no academic drift even under metaphysical stress.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mireya’s perceptions without head-hop. Diction—“brass syllables,” “gritty vernacular part piston, part prairie wind”—is idiosyncratic yet readable. Rhythm swells and contracts with stair climbs and hush, mirroring choral dynamics. No dialogue to test differentiation, but internal voice coherence is exemplary; only minor filter verbs (“she understood”) keep it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is engineered-poetic: diction of “synaptic plasticity gone feral” marries tech precision to wild image, sustaining the chaotically precise signature. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“cold fire crawled… scattering silver”—then fractures into shorter units as entanglement collapses. No dialogue, so register stays coherent. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara measures grief in drill-bit shards and basalt wings, not tears.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the prism-minded POV: syntax fractures into spectral bands, verbs like “drift-walked” and “twitch like a living scale” create perceptual signature.

Compression (“bridge became a limb, then a twig, then mere suggestion”) is taught early and paid off in descent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Aera’s perceptual signature—water read as “music scores,” silence “whirling.” Syntax mirrors aerial tempo: long liquid clauses during drift, staccato noun phrases under inversion. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress. Diction remains within pilot’s lexicon; no corporate register drift. Dialogue absent—appropriate for solitary flight—so no voice convergence issue. Minor over-reliance on participial openers in two sentences, not enough to mute rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—metallic creaks, sodium light, sub-audible hum in teeth—with no head-hop. Diction is precise yet atmospheric: “fossilized lung,” “jellyfish halos,” mirroring her forensic precision. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated (“she felt the patch pulse”). Rhythm accelerates with corridor count, then breathes outward in spiral release. Experimental elision (“she understood then”) is minor and taught early; closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by sentence-level patterning—“avalanchingly quiet” recurs, each time carrying more planetary weight. Diction stays within a desert-wanderer lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm swells then hollows to match inhalation of silence; final clause “locked behind her teeth” is a charged poise that can be tasted. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (sound as weight, light as memory).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyric-elevated but stays in Elias’s perceptual register: fragile appendages (“dragonfly-wing,” “filigree”) mirror his own trembling. Rhythm swells with aurora flares, contracts in short beats (“He walked forward”) at the threshold. No head-hopping; stranger’s dialogue carries subtext via gesture (palm-up mimicry). One clause drifts toward template cadence: “every story you’ve told, every wonder you’ve coaxed”—a necessary litany, forgiven because it precedes the luminous dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is mystic-scientific, precise yet incantatory: “silicon heart,” “glass-soft song,” “secret braille” all stay within Elian’s perceptual lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: metallic cold, silk shimmer, stone song. Syntax elongates during ascent (“each rung a bartered awakening…”) then contracts on descent, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; villagers remain external mirrors. Diction stays within rural blacksmith lexicon; “azure” is repeated motif, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, patterned: “cyclically spontaneous” becomes incantatory; syntax mirrors loom—“strands tighten around her ankles.” Perceptual signature is bias-driven—she tastes dust, feels bulkheads bend without motion. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Minor over-crank in final paragraph (“engines roar anew, cyclically spontaneous”) slightly over-pressurizes the diction, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)

    Third-person intimate maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is color-saturated, silk-and-pigment minded. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for mist, clipped fragments for pulse beats. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Lyric compression is pattern-taught early and paid off in final dissolve image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “rain hissing against its warped frame,” “tuning fork struck inside her ribs.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens during pin-drop beat, mirroring pulse. No dialogue appears; voice remains consistent, lyrical yet grounded in tool-sense. Register never drifts into academic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric omniscient voice sustains fairytale distance yet stays filter-tight through keeper’s perceptual lens—“reflections ripened into realities.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long breathless sentences during weave, fragments at rib slam. No dialogue, so voice must carry texture; does via coined compounds (“quicksilver dreams,” “tarry vines”). No head-hopping; reflections remain external until keeper re-names herself. Diction stays elemental/mineral, consistent with mica-and-mercury world.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
    Comment>Rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora (“each dawn…each repeated line”) mimics loom, then staccato “She slammed” breaks it. Information dense—one sentence can world-build, advance plot, and embody emotion: “fruits split to reveal clockwork seeds ticking backward.” No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in two adjacent “woven” phrases mid-story (−0.2) but does not touch closure. Final line earns cadence release: “dawns that no night could smother again.”
    
    <question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
    Comment>Mirrors-as-song-refusal is fresh synthesis of familiar trope; inversion orchard inverted again via mica lens delivers non-obvious reconfiguration. Specificity grounds novelty—coriander-scented lullaby, tin-foil leaves—preventing abstract allegory. Risk taken with lyric compression pays off: reader must assemble causality, but pattern taught early enough. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic fantasy: mineral lens, song-as-loom, rib-blood optics are irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s empathic sensorium; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is specific—“keenly empathetic nerves tasting arrogance, sorrow, reckless hope”—and diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells with the tranquility metaphor, then fractures into short clauses under lantern gold, mirroring her dissolving pulse. Vale’s single whispered line carries subtext, accepting the paradox without explanatory dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is highly particular: “heuristically gentle,” “flour ghosts,” “bread-born herbs.” Syntax mirrors emotional cadence—long breathless accretion during night burials, short clauses at dawn reveal. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior; diction stays within Mila’s plausible lexicon. Patterned repetition of “tenuous absolution” and “heuristically gentle” is taught early and paid off in the closing scatter.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is a sustained frost-bitten minimalism: long vowel echoes (“quartz hush,” “golden chord”) mimic the tuning-fork resonance. Perceptual signature is bias toward sound and temperature; sight is narrowed to afterimage bruises, a POV-specific filter. Sentence rhythm accelerates into staccato as vows snap—”Loyalty snapped first…Mercy’s twin tones collapsed”—mirroring the flicker. No dialogue, so those bullets are N/A; the interior monologue never drifts into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice carries a distinct salt-rot diction: "liquid night," "shine jars like fallen stars," "engine idling with illegal patience." Rhythm modulates—long cadenced clauses for vigil, staccato fragments at dawn hand-over. Perceptual signature is consistent: she catalogs contraband textures, lantern reflections, phonograph horn as "black moon." No dialogue to test, but Jonah’s silent nod and cylinder labeling read as purposive indirection fitting the hush truce. No head-hopping; focalization stays interior and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to skeptic’s perceptions; perceptual signature is gustatory-olfactory-auroral. Syntax lengthens during aurora description, shortens at brand moment, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; woman’s interior is guessed only through taste. Diction within POV lexicon—“terrestrially cosmic,” “futuristic nostalgia”—reads as taught pattern paid off in final light show. Dialogue minimal, natural: “I’ve been waiting” carries storm-weight without exposition. No register drift; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers at skin-level, mirroring artist’s synesthetic sight: “pink and pale greens bleeding like dawn over a battlefield.” Syntax lengthens and fragments under pressure, matching charcoal strokes. Perceptual signature—every surface refracts faces—stays consistent; no head-hop. “Auroral sorrow” and “pickaxe kisses” show diction calibrated to cave-light and occupational scar.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Aurelia’s perceptual signature—words blister her skin, zinc ridges “promise delivery,” moonlight “stripes” like exhausted parishioners. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under curfew fear; no head-hop. The archivist’s veil-lowering is externally observed yet carries subtextual punch. Distinctive diction (“gilded-leaf,” “zinc-etched,” “filtration veils”) sustains a consistent lyric register without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a percussive, metallic lyricism: “clacking bronze wedges,” “chordless inhale.” Perceptual signature is tuner-specific: she reads micro-oscillations the way priests read breath-scriptures.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is unmistakable: syntactic choreography mirrors content—long flowing clauses for current, staccato dice-clicks for节拍. Perceptual signature is dancer-quantified: “ghost-thrum,” “salt and singing,” “moonlit sigh.” No dialogue, so rhythm and diction carry all characterization. Compressed lyricism taught by line one and paid off in the last exhaled code.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Miren’s perceptual bias—she notices gravity’s tug, lantern codes, sailors’ coffee spirals—creating a distinct maritime-occult idiom. Syntax tilts toward lyric compression (“gravity like broken glass,” “gleaming silence”) but stays legible and pattern-taught early. No head-hopping; psychic distance shortens under stress (“taste of iron and forgetting”). Register remains within a dock-worker’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence is high.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to summoner’s perceptual signature—moonlight as “terrestrially cosmic mirror,” silence tasted as copper. Syntax lengthens and compresses with task: catalog of hushes builds cadence, then single-word “.” snaps it. No head-hop; diction stays within his monastic lexicon. Patterned repetition (“smoothed hush,” “terrestrially cosmic”) is taught early and pays off at close.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice carries a distinct architectural cadence—“grammar of cracked brick,” “euphemism of retrofit”—that remains consistent under pressure. Syntax modulates from long lyrical clauses to the staccato of meteors spelling Latin, mirroring the rising shower. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent; the internal diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon. The final “I will shelter, you will settle, we will crumble together” condenses the theme into a rhythmic, character-specific gnome without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—velvet, bruise, vinyl, chlorophyll—without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator’s attention filters everything through calligraphic precision—“each stroke of ink a small betrayal”—and aurora-color notation. Rhythm modulates: long, Latinate clauses for memory, then clipped fragments under final stress (“I forgive the unfinished”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression and elision (“calibrated treason that had destroyed everything”) are taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Lira’s sensory synesthesia; reed-blown syntax mirrors river-bend cadence. Perceptual signature precise: “taste the iron in a stranger’s blood memory.” No head-hop; old woman’s dialogue stays external, filtered through Lira’s recognition. Voice modulates from melancholic echo to forward-leaning fade without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice sustains lyric compression (“glacier groaned like a sleeping whale”) and perceptual signature of a diver-attuned to pressure, cold, and spectral sound. Patterned repetition (“windows”, “candles”, “snow globe”) is taught early and pays off in final mirror; no head-hopping. Diction stays within poetic register without register drift, though occasional abstract nouns (“connection”, “forgiveness”) soften the final hymn line slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is irradiated, compressed, synesthetic: “radioactive dust hissed,” “apples refused to fall.” Syntax mirrors Marisol’s cataloguing mind—paratactic fragments when sorting confetti, then longer coils during playback.

Syntax modulates: longer clause chains during memory flood, shorter fragments when lantern steadies, mirroring pulse. Diction ("calcified," "ghost signal") fits investigator lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Filter verbs minimal; one soft intrusion is "she realized suddenly" – forgiven. Read-aloud cadence varied, paragraph breaths align with descent/return motion.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Emil’s perceptual signature: metaphors of coins, wells, gears, storm-light echo his vocational lexicon. Olya’s dialogue carries tinkerer precision (“three deliberate clicks”) contrasting with Emil’s scriptural cadences, maintaining distinct idiom under stress. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from reflective opening to breath-short present (“footsteps syncing with the echo in his chest”). Only a single elevated clause—“contrition without consequence is merely nostalgia”—leans toward editorial intrusion, but it is brief and internally consistent with clerical rumination.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a compressed cyber-dirge: “timestamps that pulsed like dying stars,” “train rattled like a dying hard drive.” Syntax mirrors data-flow—comma-spliced clauses simulate scrolling archives.

Rhythm accelerates with tape playback, then settles into cross-legged stillness—modulation matches emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is perceptually signature: “luminous ache,” “brass blur counting possibilities” compress tech and yearning into coinage.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: patterned repetition of “memories resurfaced” teaches cadence, paid off when final line recasts them as constellations. Perceptual signature is star-watcher precise—light is “zephyr bloom cool,” color is “fugitive glimmers.” No head-hopping; distance modulates from close-sensory to mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric compression sustains a tinkerer’s perceptual signature: mechanical metaphors for organic forms (“vascular irrigation”), auditory bias for gear-clicks between verses. Rhythm accelerates with shorter anaphoric clauses as moonrim narrows. No dialogue; internal song-text substitutes spoken lines, avoiding register mismatch. Filter verbs serve voice—“she felt warmth quiver”—rather than dulling immediacy.

Rhythm modulates—long flooded sentences in fog, staccato verbs at dawn (“slipped,” “nosed,” “salvaged”)—mirroring pressure without syntactic gimmicks. No head-hop; Riga’s interior is never guessed. One near-slip: “serene upheaval” risks abstract editorial intrusion, but it recurs as earned motif, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is oceanic-philosophical, salted with kelp eyes and harbor moons; perceptual signature is distinct. Syntax flexes with pressure: long accumulative clauses build patience, then crack into single-word seed plant. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Ari.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice carries a maritime engineer’s precision—“brass pendulum,” “escapement wheel,” “mainspring”—yet tilts into salt-corroded lyricism: “obsidian teeth grinding bone.” Perceptual signature is consistent: the same mind that measures pendulum arc in inches also hears a lowered vowel as moral shift. Rhythm modulates from clipped dawn vigil to the lengthened cadence of the slowed clock, taught early and paid off in the final auditory image. No head-hopping, no register drift; every clause is oil-scented and tide-haunted.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays inside Mercy’s idiom—“uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs”—syntax mirrors her horticultural precision.

    Third-person lyric remains locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—she hears frequencies anger forgets, smells saffron in banned lullabies—so every metaphor is filtered through her acoustic exile. Syntax lengthens and shortens like breath: long anaphoric clauses build choral density, then fragment when vibrato is stripped. No head-hopping; even the city’s heartbeat is heard through her ear pressed to wood. The diction stays within her musical lexicon (“minor third,” “pure interval”) without ever sounding like glossary.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—narrowed lantern cone, fingertip braille of indentations, neural static in blackout. Syntax lengthens underwater: “water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause,” then compresses at climax: “She extinguished the lantern.” No dialogue, so naturalism N/A. Diction remains within her cataloguer lexicon—taxonomy, fibre, ledger—without academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)

Diction remains within a coastal herder’s plausible lexicon yet lifts into lyric register without strain.</answer>
    <question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: languid opening sentences mirror the frictionless stillness; propulsive clauses surge at star-dust eruption. Mixed metaphors are avoided—aurora as “borrowed dawn” is singular and sustained. One scaffold loop: “painted rocks… mathematical sequences” is restated twice without new pressure, −0.2.
