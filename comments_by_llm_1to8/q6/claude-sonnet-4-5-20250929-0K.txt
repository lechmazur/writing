  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Vera's perceptual signature: she reads frost as glass, sees "drifting resonance" in Galloway's face. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with elevated but apt phrasing ("tapestry of stars," "liquid fire to solid light"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and Galloway's lines carry subtext. One mild register slip: "drifting resonance of regret" reads slightly ornamental for the moment's tension, but the prose remains clean and propulsive overall.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's sensory deprivation: perception narrows to vibration, visual pattern, and touch. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during memory beats (ferry capsizing, mother's face). The prose carries a distinct texture—"winterglass," "phantom thunder in her skull," "thermal signature of feeling made visible"—that feels purposeful rather than ornamental. Professor Chen's notepad communication ("Your body still sings, even if your voice cannot") reads slightly expository but maintains diegetic logic. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("feeling," "watching") fit the sensory-translation focus.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Marcel; no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, slightly archaic diction that suits the undertaker's perspective and the otherworldly premise—"inadvertently stubborn in their devotion," "eliciting rest a permanent address"—though some phrasing tilts toward elevated register without clear motivation ("occupying the threshold between worlds"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close observation and reflective passages. One weakness: the prose occasionally slips into summary exposition ("The dreams showed him everything") that tells rather than dramatizes Marcel's discovery process. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the single quoted line to the ghosts feels slightly stiff but fits the formal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Mara with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("rolling the antique silver bell between her palms, feeling the inscriptions") to slightly elevated communal observation ("exile itself might not"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—the old man's "Why tell us now?" and the young woman's "Teach us" both advance the thematic question without exposition. Diction remains consistent: "shame of need compounded by statelessness" fits an educated exile leader without register drift. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mei; psychic distance modulates appropriately. Diction often elevates into lyric register ("prayers made visible," "foggy lucidity") that fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts toward ornamental abstraction ("the vast reservoir of unuttered devotion"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. The pilgrim's speech carries faint archetype quality; his lines sound interchangeable with wise-figure stock.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Lyra's observations filter through her designer's eye and her fracturing temporal experience. Diction is controlled and voice-specific in the opening and middle sections, with purposeful lexical elevation ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") that fits her professional background. However, under peak stress the prose shifts into abstract philosophizing ("the texture now—time felt like soil after rain, dense with possibility") that reads more like authorial thesis than embodied character experience. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("both designer and designed, forever discovering what she'd already known") moves toward summary rather than image, diluting immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature is purposeful: Mira notices piano patterns, seed characteristics, soil conditions—details filtered through her expertise and mission. Diction maintains elevated literary register that fits the narrative stance: "staggering grace," "hydraulic groan," "patient truth." However, some phrases drift toward thesis-delivery rather than character-specific thought: "true liberation required strategy over force" reads as narrator wisdom rather than Mira's lived idiom under pressure. Rhythm modulates appropriately between action beats and reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited with stable, close psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Mira's synesthesia ("the burgundy crackle," "if gray could sustain a diminishing note"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated; the elevated register fits a scientific mind under lyric pressure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Purposeful compression in the closing lines ("perhaps her daughter paused, feeling the ghost of something unnamed but necessary shifting in her chest") serves the accumulative design and pays off the lens without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Perceptual signature is consistent (light, crossroads, codes). Celeste's dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. The prose texture—"lunar light pooled thick as honey," "shadows into liquid pools"—is purposeful and voice-motivated. Elision of Maya's darkroom moment (the impossible portrait) is functional, priming the station revelation. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Marcus's observations filter through glassblowing idiom ("gather," "pontil," "courtship requiring patience"). His self-narration habit is voice-consistent and serves character isolation. The phrase "thoughtfully spirited despite the emptiness" and "weighty lightness his particular gift" show controlled distance and apt interiority. Minor deduction: "this weighty lightness his particular gift" reads as convenient labeling of the prompt attribute rather than emerging from dramatized contradiction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature (adaptive survival instincts, phobia awareness) colors narration. Dialogue with Reeves carries subtext and advances plot, though Reeves's exposition ("I encrypted the truth...knowing she'd never suspect") leans into helpfulness. Internal voice remains consistent, but diction occasionally elevates ("the only honest place to operate from") beyond the urgency of a night investigation. No head-hopping; filter verbs are restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on the commander with brief oracle-focused passages. The oracle's voice ("I will retell it, but by summarizing silence") carries a distinct idiom. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the commander's sparse lines reveal his need without exposition. Psychic distance is controlled, though the oracle's interiority remains largely opaque, which reads intentional given her role.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV distance remains stable in close third; J-7's perceptual signature (janitor's ordering impulse, focus on pattern and iteration) stays consistent. Dr. Yemeni's dialogue carries necessary exposition without becoming purely functional—"You're the one they chose" establishes stakes through selection. The prose modulates appropriately at the violin sequence: "not music exactly, but something between melody and mathematics" maintains technical precision under pressure. Minor issue: "remarkably composed" appears in narration rather than dramatized perception, slightly weakening the filter. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with Mira's perceptual signature (registrar's eye for detail, the lens as tool). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful. However, Dmitri's eavesdropped confession ("I don't know how to tell her") and Samir's response feel slightly expository—designed for Mira (and reader) rather than natural peer conversation. The final exchange ("I think we're done hiding...") shifts into a more articulate register than the prior beats establish. Voice is controlled but converges at closure without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Marcus. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during his initial statement about the score, pulling back to witness the vine dresser's ritual, tightening again at "understanding dawning like light through leaves." Her dialogue carries distinct pragmatic texture ("wisely pragmatic as always") without therapy-speak; the exposition about her husband's deceptions risks summary but remains anchored to present marble-polishing. Perceptual signature: Marcus notices the garden's impossible simultaneity because he's seeking answers about measurement. Diction stays consistent; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. The vine dresser's voice distinguishes through economy and certainty: "Every polished marble...mends the deception." Brief passive constructions ("were my husband's," "had been designing") serve backstory compression without momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in close third with Kael; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael reads the station through vibrations, mechanically warm surfaces, and magnetic fields. The prose carries a distinct texture—"fractured light of three distant suns," "time moved sideways, perpendicular to causality itself"—that matches the xenobiology setting without register drift. Venn's brief dialogue ("This changes everything") is functional but generic. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from technical detail to vindication. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with Marta's perceptual signature consistent (musician's ear for notes, eye for patterns, comfort in liminal rehearsal spaces). Diction matches her expertise: "C string," "fermata," "conducting baton," "Pachelbel's Canon." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming in on her tracing fingers and pulling back for the house-wide lantern blaze. Voice is distinct and maintains texture under pressure ("something she couldn't name," "wordless conversation"). No head-hopping. Minor friction: "someone—perhaps the ghost herself—had arranged flickering lanterns" introduces uncertainty about the ghost's agency that isn't fully resolved, and the phrase "lately inspired by something she couldn't name" is slightly vague for a character otherwise precise in observation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization through Mira is stable and apt; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (post-fever crystalline clarity, technical focus on data and algorithms, maternal memory of nightshade). Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven; Chen's lines ("You were talking in your sleep," "Will it prevent another accident?") advance plot and carry subtext about shared loss. Narrative distance modulates appropriately from intimate interior reflection to diagnostic console work. One minor register slip: "auroral sorrow" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the established voice, though it remains within Mira's lexicon given her precise, image-driven perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with a perceptual signature rooted in his "religiously skeptical" lens—he interprets the ghost shift as "psychic impressions" rather than supernatural. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("squatted at the edge of town like a rusted monument"). The radio-caller dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext about family complicity. One slip: the phrase "drowsy alertness" appears twice in identical form, and late-story constructions like "psychic impressions, the weight of collective guilt pressed into stone and steel and water" drift slightly into abstraction under peak pressure, though they remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV is stable and the perceptual signature—filtering decay as transition rather than loss—is consistent and character-particular. The prose carries a lyric, meditative texture appropriate to the chronicle keeper's stance: "silence pooled like water," "truth slip between her fingers like sand." Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. However, the voice edges toward elevated abstraction in peak beats ("the endless revision of truth without trying to pin it down") that reads slightly outside a lived-in idiom, and some figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "crumbling peace," "regenerative silence," "drift of untold seasons" cluster without sharp differentiation. Free indirect style is competent but the narration occasionally summarizes rather than inhabits urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV maintained throughout with stable third-person limited focalization through Mara. Perceptual signature is consistent: professional observation, metaphorical thinking ("ordinary magic," "frequencies"), controlled emotional responses. Dialogue feels natural and Thomas's sparse speech contrasts effectively with Mara's measured therapeutic voice. Register occasionally drifts into workshop language ("softly adaptive," "lifelong wonder") that feels more like craft vocabulary than embodied thought, particularly in the opening and closing reflection passages. Psychic distance stays appropriate, pulling close during the eclipse and widening for bracketing reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct, measured texture ("bronze quiet," "sensitively perceptive"). Diction matches Miren's historian sensibility without register drift. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices textures, hears whispers in objects, and connects fragments across time. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice modulates gently with discovery without artificial inflation. Minor reliance on filter verbs ("her fingers… traced," "she cared") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice carries a distinct texture: "open secrets," "the genius was that every fortune sounded exactly like every other fortune," and "directing flow—not of light, but of information." Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close interior ("Maya smiled") and slight remove for context. The fortune-writing beats carry rhythmic control and specificity. No dialogue appears on the page. Minor filter-verb clusters ("She'd spent decades learning," "She thought of all her fortunes") are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and carries a distinct idiom—"sound homilies," "muffled clarity," "decorated with silence"—that suits the priest's theological perspective. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Distance control is clean, though some phrasings ("the chamber, which decorated itself with silence as its natural state") drift toward elevated register that edges out of embodied perception. The dialogue is sparse but purposeful, using rhetorical devices as dramatized speech acts. Psychic distance remains appropriate, though the priest's interior lacks the contradictory texture that would elevate it; his perceptual signature is more conceptual than sensorially particular.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (nautilus chambers as musical notation, horizon as "visual harmony"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from sensory immediacy to reflective memory without head-hopping. Diction remains character-appropriate, though phrases like "chronological homesickness" and "mapping childhood memories like cartography" edge toward elevated register in peak beats. No dialogue present; interior voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, psychic distance controlled. Perceptual signature is character-specific: gravity "loosen[ing] its claim," time folding, symbols as "cosmic algorithm." Diction stays consistent except for register drift into elevated metaphor under pressure ("brightening darkness," "periodically eternal") that reads slightly forced for the moment. No head-hopping. The line "each timeline branched according to her deepest fears" tells rather than shows the realization, and "procedurally generated realities" borrows prompt language in a way that breaks immersion. Sentence rhythm modulates well (short bursts at the climax, longer reflection at the close), and the final paragraph's grounded simplicity earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perception filtered through Oskar's deaf experience (reading lips, feeling vibrations, visual oscilloscope patterns). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the needle examination, pulling back for reputation-spread summary. The prose carries a distinct, slightly formal texture ("filament of hush," "mirrored quiet") that matches the contemplative stakes. Marie's single line of dialogue via sign is economical and advances plot. No head-hopping. Minor slip: "enthralling" appears once in Marie's signed speech and once in the closing narration, blurring voice distinction slightly, but the effect is minimal and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Marianne notices patterns, measures rhythms). Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You nurture integrity in solitude" reveals recruitment motive). Minor slips: "credibly curious by nature" and "layered tranquility" edge toward expository labeling in narration rather than fully embodied observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider observational beats.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and literary: "space folded differently now, time leaked at the edges" carries distinct texture. Psychic distance remains stable in Marcus's focalization. Sarah's dialogue—"multiple directions," "infinite variations"—maintains the voice's metaphysical register. However, phrases like "ethically playful, a cosmic koan" and "passionate certainty" drift toward meta-commentary. The perceptual signature is poet-specific but some constructions ("末端 showing not breakage but dissolution") read as authorial flourish rather than Marcus's lived syntax under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Maya's perceptual signature (hearing harmonics in glass, water vibrations through roots) is distinct and purposeful. Diction stays within her voice—"acoustically perceptive," "unbind the music from possibility"—without register drift. Dialogue is sparse and natural; Maya's brief speech to her family carries subtext (honoring Sora, inviting participation). The prose modulates with emotional intensity: longer, lyric sentences during performance, shorter beats at the fruit-drop closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited remains stable with clean focalization through Mara's professional lens. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads emotions as "electrical residue," filters amber through molecular chemistry, and evaluates her work with craft terminology. Voice modulates effectively from clinical assessment ("professionally thorough work") to emerging doubt ("And yet"). Minor weakness: "affectionate detachment" appears as direct label twice without sufficient behavioral anchoring, and the phrase "subsume countless insects" uses an unexpected register (the verb "subsume" feels elevated for the moment's texture).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Marianne; her perceptual signature (shrewdness, "cautious exuberance") colors observation. Dialogue feels natural and advances goals: Chen's invitation to "stay a moment," Marianne's recognition of "silent contributors," and the closing exchange carry subtext of shared values. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd learned," "she'd come," "she'd built") slightly dulls immediacy, but the voice remains coherent and the psychic distance modulates purposefully. The brief direct dialogue between the two women distinguishes their tones without convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV control is stable throughout; Kael's focalization remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("prayer frozen in glass," "luminescent longing") that fits the world and emotional register. Distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the reveal. Dialogue, when present, is naturalistic and goal-driven (Siora's excitement, Kael's hesitant contribution). Minor issue: "boldly sympathetic" as an interior descriptor feels slightly imposed rather than organically shown through gesture, though the listening and teaching behaviors earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-particular: "gossamer thing," "silk made of memory," "temporal hiccups" reflect a naturalist's lyric precision. Psychic distance stays controlled; POV knowledge remains consistent (she's learned to feel temporal scars, her mentor's fever delirium). Diction modulates purposefully—compression during time manipulation ("syrup," "crystallizing") then releases into observation. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature tied to Vera's craft.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV third limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's mathematician's lens filters grief through equations, axioms, and topology. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("quantum uncertainty with the subjective experience of grief," "love could be quantified...by the shape of its absence"). Psychic distance is stable. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("dovetailed quantum uncertainty," "topology all its own") reads as character-specific rather than authorial intrusion, fitting her academic background. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual filtering (Miriam's methodical attention, scent-triggered memory). The prose voice is consistent and controlled. However, "She had been trying for so long to understand how to matter" and "keeper of sense memories" drift into abstract, thesis-like phrasing that feels authored rather than lived. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the grandmother flashback and loosens for the donation reveal without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maya notices veins, soil compositions, irrigation calibrations early, then shifts to noticing which plants "lean toward each other." Diction matches her dual identity (academic/folk), and free indirect style is clean ("exhaustion made her postpone the task"). One register slip: "circuitously sincere in her inability to admit she was becoming attached" reads more like narrator commentary than Maya's own thought pattern under her current state. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"wryly earnest," rain trails "branching like neurons," "haggard awe." Dialogue with Marcus is functional but occasionally expository ("They used to trade them…The island floods twice daily now"). Internal voice modulates with pressure but occasionally slips into summary ("she'd been following those rain trails for weeks"). No head-hopping; psychic distance held. The prose carries idiom but some filter verbs ("wanted to dismiss," "felt different") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds steady; Mara's perceptual signature (synesthesia, shadow-reading, acoustic mapping) is distinct and consistent. Voice modulates purposefully: lyric density in scene-setting, sharper clarity at confrontation. Dialogue feels goal-driven ("I didn't come seeking clarity" reversal) and advances plot. Minor register drift: "authentic surprise, genuine wonder, the everyday magic of an unknown future" in the pilgrim's speech reads slightly expository for a character who is an emissary of unseen forces—phrasing tilts toward thematic summary rather than idiomatic speech under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; Marina's perceptual signature filters everything through reactive archival attention (the valve "seemed to matter," staggered viewing intervals). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven when present; Thomas's "I thought everything would be gone" and Marina's "Nothing's gone" advance plot and carry subtext about erasure and preservation. Interior diction stays consistent and character-particular ("monument to empty spaces," "navigated absences"). Narrative distance modulates purposefully: close during the valve exchange, wider during the reunion panorama. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (analytical mind catalogues angles while her hand moves intuitively) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue with the conductor is spare, carries subtext, and advances plot. The conductor's archaic uniform and brass punch distinguish her voice from Mara's modern analytical idiom. However, phrases like "trembling certainty" and "starlight contract" drift into elevated metaphor that edges beyond Mara's established cartographer diction under pressure. Psychic distance holds cleanly with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with close psychic distance; Elena's perceptual signature (marine biologist filtering setting through decades of study, anchoring in empirical language before yielding to mystical experience) is distinct. Free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific: "the overwhelming intimacy of carrying her grandmothers' memories" and "the deeper truth she'd inherited understood" read as external narration rather than Elena's idiom under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Narrative certainty matches POV except for the mystical-reveal beat, where the mechanics are told with unearned confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited through Cassius; perceptual signature (dimensionally aware, seeing equations in light, magnetic fields as serpents) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext—Naia's "You always do" and "At least let me satisfy both our curiosities" pursue goals (permission, closure) while wounding. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax. Two slips lower the score: "hushed thunder quality she'd perfected over centuries" tells rather than shows voice texture, and "understanding blooming like poison" is a stock metaphor that doesn't match Cassius's sensory idiom established elsewhere (crystalline, magnetic, prismatic). Both occur in mid-beats, not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in tight third over Mara; perceptual signature is mathematical and precise ("steady as a heart monitor's flat line"). Dialogue carries subtext—Vincent's "you don't understand the world" versus Mara's equation logic—and the lines pursue goals (persuasion, defense). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at Vincent's breakdown. Minor slip: "liquefied rigid thinking" in the asylum-paperwork description feels slightly elevated for Mara's present-tense observation, though it echoes her analytical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the stationer notices temporal textures, lamp frequencies, and disproportion through a craftsperson's tactile lens ("worn soft as cloth," "texture felt like memory itself"). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent, with controlled elevation ("incandescent restraint," "visual poetry") that matches her scholarly fabrication practice. However, several phrases drift into authorial register rather than character-filtered perception: "химical glow" reads observational but clinical; "Each observation... remained precise, contained, though the scene itself threatened to overwhelm" is meta-commentary about her prose style rather than her experience. The final paragraph's "Even here, especially here" construction and the gilded-leaves callback demonstrate strong control, but peak moments occasionally prioritize lyricism over immediacy (e.g., "blooms remember being large" anthropomorphizes without anchoring in her bodily perception).

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices "patterns in rust streaks and meaning in spray-painted numbers." The prose texture is purposeful, with sentence rhythm modulating effectively ("Each container held fragments of erased histories—abandoned shipments, forgotten goods, lives interrupted mid-transit"). The brief dialogue exchange with the harbormaster feels natural and advances plot economically. However, phrases like "She filtered reality differently now" and "memory's texture requires both preservation and loss" drift into slightly elevated register that doesn't fully match the established close-third voice of someone living in container stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's professional skepticism colors early perception ("Nonsense, of course. Beautiful, heartbreaking nonsense"). Psychic distance tightens during the cello-playing sequence. The reimagined dialogue—grandmother's voice versus Mira's past replies—feels slightly expository ("Your stories are lovely, but they're not true" / "You think truth is only what you can measure") rather than subtext-driven. Diction is consistent but leans toward lyric abstraction ("peculiar space between breath and silence," "visible threads") that softens immediacy under peak emotional pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Marina's perceptions and memories. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("culture shock absorber," "hopeful desperation"), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("orderly intuitive nature," "weave themselves into the community's fabric") that feels slightly authorial. The brief dialogue at the end serves purpose but arrives too late to test voice distinction. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Chen's perceptual signature is consistent (scientific yet reverent). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("condemned cathedral of stone," "photochemical cascade") that reads competent but not voice-particular. No dialogue to assess. The psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. Filter verbs ("noticed," "read") appear but don't dull immediacy. Syntax varies purposefully, though some constructions lean formal.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; her perceptual signature (sound, water, temperature) is consistent and specific. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot: Voss's "How do you do this?" and Mara's metaphoric reply both pursue character goals and carry subtext. The prose reflects Mara's sensory hierarchy—"she knew they were high because of how sounds echoed differently throughout the day"—without filter-verb clutter in peak moments. One voice slip: "She oversees all repairs this way" shifts into a summary register that feels externalized rather than rooted in Mara's present experience. Distance control is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable and Mira's perceptual signature is distinct: she reads meaning in ephemera, traces convergence, spots cartographic errors. Diction fits her technical background ("tributary maps," "hydrological," "watershed patterns"). Petrov's dialogue ("You're still chasing ghosts") and Mira's dry correction establish voice contrast. Psychic distance remains consistent. Vocabulary choices like "worrying tranquility" and "ghost of its convergence" are purposeful. One minor slip: "subtly confident posture" is told rather than shown through gesture, though the trait manifests in her speech and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to external observation of the bell tuner with occasional dips into residents' impressions ("felt something shift in their chests"). The prose has a measured, fable-like texture ("infinitely slowly," "ghost town remembered how to live") that suits the tone. However, the bell tuner's interiority is opaque by design, and the residents speak in brief, functional lines that lack distinct idiom. Dialogue ("What are you listening for?" / "The frequency of hope") advances exposition but carries minimal subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "appeared") stack in several beats without clear voice motivation. The perceptual signature is consistent but generic; no character-specific bias in noticing emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clean: she notices the oxygen gauge, assesses vitals, feels the vial's warmth. Dialogue serves goal pursuit (Chen's plea, Mara's directive) and carries subtext (Chen's "I found it" reveals obsession before stating it). Diction fits an experienced rescuer without corporate drift. Minor density issue: "understanding dawning" is a stock phrase that slightly flattens Chen's realization beat. Free indirect distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "copper light made the ocean look like molten metal," "corridors that smelled of rust and regret." Diction remains controlled and voice-particular throughout. Dialogue from the prisoners is functional but slightly interchangeable in idiom; the oldest prisoner's "Classic cry wolf" line feels anachronistic for the setting's tone. No head-hopping or POV leakage; filter use is minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Marcus's anxious inheritance-seeker perspective. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter when the bead burns, wider when Eleanora narrates backstory. Eleanora's dialogue carries period diction ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous") that distinguishes her from Marcus's simpler speech. Some phrases lean ornate without clear character motivation: "through ephemeral cameo appearances at the edge of vision" reads more like narration for the reader than Marcus's perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but could be sharper—Marcus notices the bead's hum and temperature but his filtering of the greenhouse feels generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the weaver's perceptual signature (craft idiom, harbor-town lens) is consistent. Diction is controlled and atmospheric, with purposeful rhythm shifts. However, several passages ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace," "carve a path from ruin to reverence") elevate into a slightly generic literary register that feels prompted rather than character-rooted. The prose at peak moments (new moon circuit, final departure) maintains clarity but lacks the compression and charge expected at 8.5+. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs are infrequent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose has purposeful compression and a lyric cadence ("white petals drifting down like snow," "fractured shadows across the walls"). Perceptual signature is present in Miriam's filtering of ritual and memory. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cautious reverence," "tentative, more honest") that feels external rather than interior, and the final paragraph's syntax flattens into expository summary. The voice is controlled but not under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Iris notices codes, textures (cool brass, worn marble), and historical weight in ways that reflect her profession and longing. Diction remains within her register throughout. Purposeful compression ("who would hide secrets in something so ephemeral, so childlike?") and reflection are anchored to present stimuli (the chalk, the letter). Rhythm modulates with pressure: short, clipped sentences at the mail-slot moment ("Everything could still be taken back, unmade, kept secret") accelerate tension. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or voice convergence. Elision of the letter's exact contents is purposeful, serving the emotional cost rather than withholding for suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mirelle's perceptual signature (listening, embroidering, playing roles) remains consistent and distinct. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance stable. Commander Vas's brief dialogue ("Still playing with your stitchery, old woman?") and Mirelle's cackle show subtext and goal-driven performance. Prose texture fits the intelligence-gathering frame: "adjacent possibilities," "galaxy chart disguised as decorative nonsense," "echoed silence." Minor slip: "She had been listening for three months now, not to the stars but to the unheard stories trapped in echoed silence between official declarations" front-loads theme in narrator register rather than letting perception do the work (−0.2). No head-hopping; voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and filters the scene through sensory detail and Meera's practiced tenderness. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven ("I can't bring her back... But I can help you find the moment before deciding"). The prose maintains a consistent lyric register—"roots twisted like arthritic fingers," "fierce tenderness"—that suits the mystical atmosphere. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV distance stable; narrative certainty matches focalizer's drugged state with appropriate perceptual compression ("peculiar clarity that comes just before thinking becomes impossible"). Diction reflects professional idiom ("navigate," "decrypt," "translate between silence and speech") without jarring register drift. Perceptual signature—translator parsing meaning in all contexts—is consistent and distinct. One minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" in line describing her mental quality reads slightly external/diagnostic rather than fully embodied, though the concept is dramatized in prior reflection about children's devastating questions.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV, third-person limited with stable distance and character-specific perceptual signature: "watching colors emerge," "ghost-shapes of apple blossoms." Diction remains within Mara's artist lexicon; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: short bursts during epiphany ("Of course"), longer sweeps during mural creation. Filter verbs ("noticed," "imagining") are voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the daydream beat ("let her vision soften") and recovers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Lena's sensory and professional filter. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices cracks, pigments, vibrations, and layers. Diction stays within her restorer's idiom ("dead pigment," "methodically playful," "finest tools"). The phrase "methodically playful" recurs purposefully as a character anchor. One minor register slip: "making them reveal hidden geometries" reads slightly elevated for in-the-moment perception, though it could be Lena's learned architectural vocabulary. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias's POV is stable, and his "candidly cryptic" idiom is consistent ("they can't tax what they can't read"). The perceptual signature is selective—he notices butterfly patterns, rattle rhythms, and the entomologist's legacy—but his voice lacks contradictory urgency or stress-driven compression at the climactic "begin." Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("How many tonight?"), though Mara's response could carry more subtext. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance remains controlled. The prose has texture, but the ending's elevated register ("their roots sinking deep into consciousness") feels slightly sermonic rather than character-grounded perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV interiority is stable and richly textured, with perceptual signature rooted in the poet's metaphor-making ("reef-shadow joy," "photosynthesized"). Diction remains character-bound and purposeful. A minor register drift appears in "constitutionally unable to achieve" and "ensconcing each mundane detail within metaphor"—slightly elevated phrasing that edges toward exposition—but these do not obscure voice or closure. No head-hopping, no elision debt. Distance is consistent and the prose reflects the mind of the focalizer throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Miren; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, contemplative texture with purposeful elevated diction ("foxglove regret," "prismatic shadows," "frozen music") that suits the setting and Miren's archival sensibility. Perceptual signature is consistent: Miren notices light refraction, botanical detail, acoustic nuance. The prose occasionally drifts toward museum-catalog register ("climate-controlled vaults," "efficiency protocols") that feels expository rather than character-lived. Psychic distance is controlled, though the reflection-heavy mode mutes immediate scene texture in places.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited, stable throughout. Mira's perceptual signature privileges linguistic structure ("loops and pressure-marks," "grammatical threads") and her professional idiom colors the narration. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Marcus's "Read it aloud" and the closing exchange advance plot and carry subtext about vulnerability. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("precarious balance," "wounded quiet") but remains within an academic register plausible for the POV. The phrase "carefully reckless abandon" attempts paradox but lands as contradiction rather than character texture. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when Mira writes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with clear focalization through Mira's professional and emotional lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices adhesive fibers, pH, pressure channels, mineral deposits—details filtered through her machinist's training. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "encrypted compassion," "dappled resolve," "sly genius of it" read as imposed rather than emergent from Mira's voice. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, and free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final reflections tilt toward narrator wisdom rather than Mira's uncertain thought process. Overall voice is distinctive but occasionally ventures into lyric abstraction that dilutes the character's particular way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: contemplative, sensory-specific, lyric without obscuring causality. Perceptual signature is character-particular (air currents, dust mapping, pigeons as trust metaphor). Psychic distance is stable; reflection anchors in present stimuli (meteorite in hand, dust in skylight, Marcus humming below). No dialogue present, so those bullets do not apply. Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "Trust was a pigeon released into storm clouds" reads slightly elevated for the focalizer's established register under peak pressure, though it coheres with her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's architectural-analytic lens colors every observation (oak rings, surveyor's precision, pattern analysis). Diction is controlled and lyric without register drift. Thomas's brief dialogue serves subtext without voice bleed. The psychic distance tightens appropriately during the grain-reading beats and opens for atmospheric sweep. Filter verbs ("felt," "heard") are voice-motivated and sparse. Pronoun references stay clear despite the father's off-page presence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Senna throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyricism ("shadowseam wonder," "fireflies of summer" simile) that matches the atmospheric tone without slipping into purple excess. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven ("Show me," "We have until sunrise"). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The phrase "excitement captivating her voice" is slightly awkward (captivating usually takes an object), but overall the perceptual signature is consistent and the prose reflects Senna's contemplative, pattern-seeking mind.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with a perceptual signature: Marina notices "sea-foam recollectionist" details, crater glass, transliteration symbols. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("iridescent," "transliterating," "conjecture"), fitting a scholar-protagonist. However, some filter verbs ("she'd come to think of," "Marina realized with a gasp," "understanding dawning") dull immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping or tense slips. The prose modulates with pressure but leans toward narrated summary during the discovery rather than dramatized perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Mara's perceptual signature is distinct—she reads people through chess moves and maps variables obsessively. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Rebecca's "You're good at reading people, terrible at protecting yourself" carries subtext about Mara's blind spot. Minor filter-verb presence ("she'd arranged," "she'd taught") fits the reflective voice and doesn't dull immediacy. Diction remains consistent; no unmotivated register shifts. The reflective passages about her father anchor in present stimuli (bishop in pocket, the performance) and tilt present choices toward openness.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("obsidian grace," "kinaesthetic poetry," "hieroglyph spelling out a single, complex truth"), which matches the ceremonial tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that sounds more like authorial commentary than Kaleth's embodied perception. Perceptual signature (dance vocabulary, attention to gaps and currents) is coherent. No head-hopping. The register remains stable, though phrases like "elective exile" and "cosmic verse" read as prompt-adjacent rather than character-lived idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance stays close enough to access Martin's perceptions while allowing lyric phrasing. Voice is distinct and controlled: "mist swirled through its broken ceiling, transforming the structure into something between ruin and cathedral" balances sensory grounding with elevated register appropriate to Martin's contemplative state. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: phrases like "liminal hour before everything shifts" and "commune with something larger than himself" elevate diction slightly beyond what a working glazier might naturally formulate under stress, though the overall texture remains coherent. No dialogue present; perceptual signature (trained to see fractures, noticing light bending) is character-specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (firefighter's lens on burn scars, celestial time-keeping, forest regeneration) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "topography of burn scars," "bargained innocence," and "hard softness" occasionally drift into elevated metaphor that feels authorial rather than Marcus's own idiom under duress. Psychic distance is appropriate for reflective mode. The prose rhythm modulates between summary and image effectively. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not judged.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Mira's conceptual focus (equations, patterns, measurements). Voice carries a lyric precision—"serene upheaval," "tide-polished grotto"—that fits the character's logical-dreamer stance. The unison dialogue ("The equation doesn't need to prevent divergence…") breaks focalization by giving all three Miras identical articulation, which flattens the multi-timeline premise into a single voice. Psychic distance remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "conversations in the way sound bent around corners, read emotions in acoustic reflections." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spatial memory," "ghost-pressure") that feels more authorial than character-grounded, especially under emotional pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric register ("dusky harmony," "liminal moment," "mirror-maze of what might yet be"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Vesper notices refracted light, alternate truths, patterns invisible to others. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("calcify the entire culture," "portals to potential") beyond what the close POV earns, though it remains legible. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate. The rhythmic control supports the accumulative mode but some phrases ("perceptively calm," "borrowed heartbeat") repeat their conceptual work without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maren's perceptual signature shows in "operatively gentle" and "penitent's cross," filtering diplomatic tools through spiritual weight. Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated to disarm without diminishing" reads as authorial gloss rather than Maren's lived syntax, and "This is the price of redemption" edges toward thesis articulation. Dialogue when present ("This is manipulation—" / "This is the method") advances goals cleanly. Diction stays controlled except for one or two explanatory asides that break the otherwise strong narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds steady; Marcus's perceptual signature is consistent (cartographer reading fissures, pricing guilt, "dense as grief"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "ethics were simply market inefficiencies," "nested in the spaces between profit margins." No dialogue to evaluate. Minor slips: "spectrograms of vanished species" and "cloud-seeding prevention" momentarily drift into technical catalog, and "felt something like grace fracture through him" softens the established clinical register at the peak without clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with Celestine's perceptual filter consistent (courtly elegance, restrained determination). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the voice: "bodily poetic grace," "the lullaby of conformity," "alarming serenity" feel more thematic than character-rooted. No dialogue appears, so naturalism tests don't apply. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter phrases ("she had heard," "she knew better") soften immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose texture reads more authorial than character-particular, especially in abstract passages about "echoes" and "the space between sigh and smile."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tighter during the puppet work, slightly elevated in reflection). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Marcus notices "silk cravat," "elegant precision," the dome's radar function—details filtered through his urbane, analytical lens. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated. The prose occasionally slips into mild exposition ("For years, he'd wielded narrative like a weapon") that tells his history cleanly but without the compression or textural surprise that would elevate to the 8+ band. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature filters setting through architectural and ecological awareness ("hemp rope binding green wood," "dust-fine scales," "its orange wings catching light that seemed to blush"). Diction is elevated but consistent with an artist-narrator reflecting on extinction and impermanence. One register slip: "esoteric realist" and "Architectures of Impermanent Meaning" read slightly convenient as self-labels rather than earned through dramatized work. The phrase "blushing stillness" recurs as a tonal anchor but risks preciousness. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is controlled, with Mira's caster's attention shaping what is noticed (braids, tools, investment). Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("snowmelt ardor," "grey-chorus") that modulates with emotional intensity. However, phrases like "technically gentle" repeat across beats without varied embodiment, and the narrative occasionally drifts toward explanatory summary ("The transcribed memory technique was technically gentle—it didn't force or command") that flattens immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not as selective under pressure as the high band requires.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent metaphysical register; diction ("precisely playful," "mycelial networks," "crystallized dreams") coheres as voice-motivated elevated style. Perceptual signature is clear (past/future vision, present opacity). However, under peak reflection—when she processes the archive dreams and reaches understanding—the prose shifts into expository summarization ("She saw herself from outside time...") that tells the insight rather than dramatizing it through embodied perception or micro-choice. No dialogue is present; filter verbs ("understood," "saw," "began to transcend") cluster in the final third without dramatized action, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person POV with stable focalization throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (astronomical lens, frugal detail-noticing). Diction remains within the astronomer's plausible register, though phrases like "encrypted devotion" and "dusky harmony" recur with enough frequency to verge on authorial motif rather than character-particular perception. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure, quickening during the shadow revelation and slowing during reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Kale's fury-then-wonder is mostly stable; Mira's interiority remains external. Voice carries a formal, almost fable-like register ("scheming pacifist," "calcified into destiny") that fits the Sanctuary's timeless frame. Light-text dialogue sidesteps naturalism concerns and adds stylistic texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("release his resentment," "willingness to let go") and prompt echo ("shifting grace" as label rather than perceptual signature). Psychic distance holds, though the cellular-memory visions blur whose knowledge we're tracking—Kale's reception or an omniscient overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Aria's craft-focused perception. Diction is elevated but consistent: "prismatic fragments," "breath-like rhythm," "glass-mountain fog" cohere as a singular idiom. The brother's brief dialogue ("I found where all boundaries end") carries metaphysical weight fitting the tone without breaking voice. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled; purposeful compression in the middle (synchronized breathing sequence) maintains clarity and momentum. Filter verbs are minimal. The final paragraphs modulate tone effectively, moving from procedural focus to quiet reunion without register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focused through Marta's perceptual signature: she notices craft details (the grinding stone's angle, the quartz's needs) and interprets through family history. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the teaching demonstration. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Lena's "Deciduous vows aren't about breaking promises, are they?" pursues understanding rather than exposition. Diction stays within Marta's lexicon (quartz-eye mender's concrete vocabulary, not academic abstraction). One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("had called," "had sworn," "had signed") slightly dulls immediacy, though the effect is brief and doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature (curator's lens, bathroom-epiphany pattern) is consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("phosphorescence," "loam of crushed starlight"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at key beats: "the vulnerability of hot water and solitude," "channels of time's own strange fruit." These phrases feel ornamental rather than character-specific under pressure. The final paragraph's syntax ("only cultivated, only lived, only passed along") employs purposeful repetition but risks rhythmic sameness. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marin's perceptual signature as an arcane linguist is consistent and specific: she recognizes proto-linguistic fragments, hears the symphony's mathematical structure, chooses "words that existed between languages." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The time traveler's dialogue ("You can hear it too") and Marin's negotiation carry subtext and goal pursuit. Minor: the phrase "unheard symphony" recurs but risks becoming a label rather than a lived texture; once in the final paragraph, "unheard symphony shifted into a new movement" feels slightly mechanical rather than filtered through Marin's embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-close, perceptual signature distinct (fog as "erasing fingers," memories "colonizing," joy "unkindled"). Soren's voice carries different diction ("You're holding it wrong," "recapture it") that feels like memory-echo rather than head-hop. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter at porthole and mirror beats, slightly wider during garden explanation. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph three ("had discovered," "had come," "felt") slightly dulls immediacy under rising pressure, and "she understood finally" tells the realization beat rather than showing the click.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Maren's perceptual signature—archival precision, warmth, methodical observation—comes through in diction ("patient labor," "leather satchel," cross-referencing notebooks). Her habit of talking to herself during solo research ("This strand here represents the east wing, doesn't it?") adds voice texture. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("warmly methodical," "adaptable thinking," "clear complexity of truth") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains focalization cleanly; narrative certainty matches what Maren plausibly knows through her archival research.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with clear perceptual signature: Kael's mapkeeper training filters everything (ripple marks, crack patterns, mental maps). Distance is consistent and voice modulates effectively under pressure ("forced himself to listen past them"). One notable friction: "gently luminous" appears three times in identical phrasing for the lantern, creating a minor template echo that dulls immediacy. The prose stays within Kael's plausible register, and focalization remains tight—no head-hopping or unearned certainty. Purposeful elision (the exact mechanics of the stone's activation) serves the accumulative design rather than withholding known facts.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice leans poetic and elevated ("frost flowers," "thistle-blown hope," "tapestry larger than collapse or chaos"), which reads more authorial than Esme-particular under pressure. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew," "she saw") cluster in high-information beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains stable but the diction does not degrade under urgency. No dialogue on the page. The perceptual signature tilts toward lyricism rather than Esme's occupational or emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric ("weather that no longer merely passed but accumulated, becoming architecture"), with purposeful compression and elevated diction consistent throughout. POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear (shadow lengths, feeling-tones, temporal depth). The one concern: "deepening hush" and "stormlit" recur as atmospheric labels rather than fresh perception, and "whispering" appears three times, trending toward template cadence. Still, rhythm modulates with discovery beats and the prose stays legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable; psychic distance tightens during the spinning sequence without head-hopping. Diction is consistent and body-specific: "fingers tracing patterns in the air," "figure eights, halos, thread-the-needle motions." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the woman's lines pursue recruitment without exposition dump. Brief dialogue exchange ("You're the one who designs light" / "I was. Now I just walk" / "Good") advances plot economically. Minor deduction for the woman's idiom occasionally sliding toward facilitator-archetype ("filtering our awareness differently") rather than fully individuated voice, and one filter-verb cluster ("felt," "realized") in the final paragraph that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV through Chen is stable and controlled; his perceptual signature (decades of attention to subtle signs, reading tidal cues and his daughter's body language) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and pursues goals: Mira's "You weren't even listening" and Chen's "It was your mother's" both advance the emotional negotiation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from Chen's clinical observation to his final vulnerability ("facing it straight on would have broken me"). Minor register note: "transform" and "chronicle" recur frequently, risking slight lexical convergence, but the voice remains character-particular and the diction fits Chen's profession.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices atmospheric pressure, silence frequencies, and spatial paradoxes (intangibly tangible sky). Diction occasionally elevates beyond her immediate crisis register ("gilded hush," "xenial," "curdling into resignation"), creating minor distance wobbles during peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interior ("her racing heart") and wider framing ("her mother's generation"). No dialogue present; internal voice carries distinct texture through the silence-collection conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV through Marco is stable and his professional filter (monitoring decibels, noting formations, adjusting course) gives perceptual signature. Dialogue pursues goals—Marco teaches, Elena resists then opens—and carries subtext in her silences and monosyllables. The line "understanding flooding through him with fluidly logical certainty" elevates diction into abstract register atypical of moment-to-moment perception under pressure. Elena's whispered confession and Marco's pedagogical cadence distinguish their voices, though Marco's interior occasionally lectures the reader rather than thinking through his own uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited and voice is distinct ("futuristic nostalgia," "world-that-was"). Psychic distance is consistent. The ruby flake "spoke—not in sound but in pure data streaming" is an elegant filter that respects Kaida's neural interface. Minor slip: "She was a lore keeper, and she'd finally found what had always been waiting" in the final paragraph edges toward helpful-narrator summary rather than trusting the image. Perceptual signature is present but could be sharper under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during interior reflection, wider during the girl's approach). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("You already have" reframes entry as internal shift). Mara's perceptual signature—tender, deliberate, image-oriented—remains distinct. Minor register drift: "method of linking through scars" and "loaded emptiness" read slightly elevated for the established voice, and the final paragraph's declarative cadence ("This is space. This is the oxygen...") flattens rhythmic variance under the story's peak emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV with stable third-limited focalization. Diction is mostly consistent, though "virtuously mischievous" and "shadowseam" read as prompt-label insertions rather than organic voice. Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices quantum hums and parallel selves through her survivor lens. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, peak-pressure moments rely on abstract metaphor ("liquid light," "threads of probability") rather than concrete sensory grounding, and the "seventeen different directions" opener, while vivid, is never anchored in physical cause.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct, slightly formal register ("eloquently silent," "understanding flooding through him") that fits Cassian's educated background and moral gravity. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices mechanical detail, interprets gaps, and filters the space through his penance mission. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose modulates appropriately from the amber-lit opening to the violet close. However, diction occasionally edges toward literary abstraction ("the bridge of intuition had held, connecting past confession to present reckoning") that reads more like authorial summary than character-specific thought under pressure, and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("waiting for the next person brave enough to listen") steps slightly outside Cassian's immediate frame.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated, contemplative diction ("gossamer filaments," "cosmic force") suits a withdrawn knight processing philosophical stakes. Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("the question was whether you moved with eyes open or closed") reads as thesis-speak rather than crisis thought, straining POV modesty under peak pressure. Perceptual signature (watching trees, sensing strings) is character-specific, but the lexicon ("factually mystical," "shivering bliss") occasionally drifts into authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tightly bound to Miriam's archival perception ("dust rise in a thin column," "faint pathways like rivers on a map"). Diction is controlled and character-specific (archivist's lexicon: "manila folders," "emancipation cases," "cross-references"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("chest tightened") to reflective summary in the final beat. No dialogue is present, so that bullet is not applicable. The prose rhythm accelerates during the discovery sequence and breathes at closure, supporting pressure without head-hopping or filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices underestimation, obsolete tech, and tactical details. Diction remains controlled—"auric," "phytoplankton," "emulsion"—without jarring register shifts. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates appropriately from observational calm to compressed urgency when the searchlight sweeps. One minor slip: "already planning how she would reappear" in the final line edges toward summary rather than staying in the vault's present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable throughout; Marcus's perceptual signature filters the grotto through musical metaphor ("the careful architecture of quiet," "anti-melody"). Voice remains consistent, though occasional register drift appears ("vested hush," "negative space of conversations") that feels slightly elevated for a saxophonist's natural idiom. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the playing sequence. The phrase "quietly vivid" in the final paragraph reads as a self-conscious callback rather than organic perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is consistent (weight/viability classifications, pattern recognition) and diction remains elevated throughout without jarring shifts. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "felt") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the reflective mode. The prose carries distinct texture ("veins through perpetual twilight," "hush where past meets prophecy") though some phrases edge toward stock lyricism. No dialogue present; interior access is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus filters setting through a tinkerer's lens (springs, gears, corrosion). The prose modulates purposefully—compressed in the opening, expansive in the chamber discovery, rhythmic at closure. The phrase "uncertainly certain" recurs with purpose, and diction remains consistent. Minor slips: "when coincidence becomes pattern, his mother used to say" introduces filter distance that slightly dulls immediacy, and the admiral's voice in the notes risks convergence with the narrator's elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance; Mara's perceptual signature (alchemical precision, grief-tinged observation) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the magistrate's "It's broken" and Mara's reply carry subtext (acceptance vs. transformation). The phrase "factually mystical" in narration risks register drift but reads as Mara's professional idiom. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is consistent ("modestly fearless," her way of noticing frequencies and temperatures). Diction stays character-particular and controlled under pressure. The shade's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, pursuing confession and release. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the tooth flares and when Kael laughs. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Sera's enhanced perception. Voice is distinct: "turning her body into an instrument that perceived too much" and "bracing...against the terrifying possibility of peace" carry character-specific diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from tight sensory immersion to brief reflective passages. The old man's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor weaknesses: "our penance" and "enhancement remains, but we choose what we enhance" edge toward thematic statement rather than implication, though they're delivered in dialogue rather than narration. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. The vendor's direct address ("You're looking for…") and Mira's interior reflection interweave cleanly. Diction remains within Mira's register—translator's vocabulary, metaphors of layering and seeing—though the vendor's exposition about the lighthouse keeper trends slightly mechanical. Dialogue carries subtext (the vendor's knowledge of Mira's grandmother) and advances plot by providing the fragment and its instruction. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices overlapping realities, repurposed materials, hidden details. Free indirect style is clean, tense is stable, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately between market visit and studio discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with free indirect touches: "He'd learned that buildings spoke through their mechanical voices—but also through the other presences that lingered." Perceptual signature is distinct—Marcus notices dust patterns, ventilation, his trained eye scanning acoustic tiles. His dialogue with the ghost ("The carousel… This powered it?") feels natural, goal-driven, pursuing understanding. Psychic distance tightens at closure: "she seemed almost solid, almost real." No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Voice modulates from professional observation to quiet promise without register drift. The prose reflects his mind: methodical, observant, unbothered by the supernatural.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and aptly distant for the fable-like tone. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("phantom sunlight," "dewdrops waiting to fall"), though it occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism that risks obscuring Marina's immediate sensory experience under stress ("the truth Marina had spent three hundred identical mornings avoiding" tells more than it shows). Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext; the operator's lines pursue goals (awakening Marina) through cryptic indirection. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: a defeated revolutionary's diction ("words were weapons," "mobilize the masses") modulates into archaeological patience without losing its fervor. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—reading symbols "the powerful tried to hide"—filters all observation. Minor deduction: "burnished sorrow" appears as authorial phrase in the final line rather than fully inhabiting Kasimir's internal lexicon, a slight distance slip after otherwise tight focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Aldric's professional lens: jeweler's loupe, understanding of resonance, recognition of philosopher's stone. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices mechanism details, acoustic properties, alchemical traces. Diction fits the artisan-scholar register throughout. Minor register wobble: "the space between function and purpose" and "tinkersong wonder" tilt slightly abstract for the otherwise concrete technical voice, though they remain within plausible reach. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The duchess appears only in reported speech, keeping focalization clean.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices geological detail, scent, acoustic properties. Diction remains controlled ("petrichor," "delve," "phosphorescence") and voice-motivated for a character steeped in geology and scent taxonomy. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "irreducibly strange" and "architecture of certainty" edge toward elevated abstraction in a few beats, though they stay within Mara's plausible lexicon given her education. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful elision (Henrik's exact fate mechanism) is taught and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Maya's perceptual signature (artist's eye for "simplified forms," "storm-gifted shapes," "translucent chambers"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though phrases like "turbine-hum reverie" and "timewoven alliances" drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-interior. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close sensory detail and reflective passages. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats, compressing during discovery and breathing during the conceptual turn. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds stable POV through Mara's perceptual signature (artist's eye notices "captured fire," "luminous even in faded ink," "dawning hush"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances understanding without exposition dumps; Father Benedict's lines pursue a goal (reframe Mara's question) through metaphor rather than direct instruction. Diction remains consistent within Mara's artistic register. However, "umbral tenderness" in the priest's speech feels elevated beyond his established plain-spoken voice, and the phrase "across the melting of winter's last snow" in the opening reads as narrator overlay rather than Mara's immediate perception, creating minor distance inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Malik with clean focalization. Sarai's dialogue ("Am I?") carries subtext and her voice is distinct from Malik's interior register. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated, somewhat abstract diction ("searing reverie," "solemn as a benediction," "terrible logic") that feels imposed rather than character-specific, especially under pressure. Filter verbs ("he understood," "he'd read enough testimony to recognize") appear but remain acceptable within voice. The dialogue is sparse but functional; Sarai's lines pursue goals (recruit Malik as messenger) and the subtext is clear. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraphs shift toward a more distant, thematic register that summarizes rather than inhabits the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Miranda's focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated ("crucible," "catalyzing," "dreaming the dreams that only closed vessels can contain") but remains consistent with an alchemist's lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during bottle examination, wider during the summary of others' arrival). One register slip: "the stubborn refusal to accept comfortable endings" reads as authorial commentary rather than Miranda's perception. No dialogue, so those bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited to Marcus is stable throughout both shards, with clean section breaks and no head-hopping. Voice maintains a measured, archival tone that fits the material, and diction remains controlled. However, perceptual signature is thin—Marcus's way of noticing doesn't evolve between child and adult, and elevated register occasionally drifts ("venerable oath scribe," "velvet disquiet") without strong POV justification. Madame Verity's dialogue (ancient languages, then English) is purposeful but her interior remains inaccessible, limiting relational texture.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with controlled psychic distance. Diction carries a consistent poetic register ("shimmer in the air that tasted like metal and memory," "furiously tranquil"). Perceptual signature is present but leans abstract rather than character-specific: the vocabulary of entropy, temporal mass, and vortex inheritance reads more conceptual than idiomatically Mara's. No head-hopping. Minor filter-verb stack in the spiral sequence ("feeling it unwind... feeling them remembering") slightly dulls immediacy at a key beat. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, with perceptual signature in "microclimate variations," "atmospheric rivers collided," and tactile focus (rope texture, vibration). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. Brief reflection ("They didn't understand what she'd discovered") anchors in the present via the rope and tilts the override choice. Psychic distance tightens during the storm sequence ("Mara held the rope throughout") without filter clutter. The prose reflects her expertise (barometric pressure drop, old bell pattern) and calm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Kael's perceptual signature—filtering through spiritual metaphor and cleaning ritual—is distinct. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("permeable, present, powerful in her acceptance of smallness") that risks essay voice but recovers through concrete action (mop, lantern, logging). The prose modulates appropriately between reflective passages and present action. Filter verbs ("She thought about," "she saw") appear but don't dull immediacy given the meditative tone. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Mara's perceptual filter ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive"). Diction is controlled and poetic without purple excess, though phrases like "self-imposed prison" and "mute eloquence" occasionally drift toward meta-commentary. No dialogue on the page; all speech is Mara reading the letter aloud, which fits the mute-world logic. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening at the box discovery and widening for thematic reflection. The prose texture is consistent and lyric, with rhythm that breathes in step with Mara's measured movements. Minor filter-verb presence ("she saw," "she understood") is voice-appropriate and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout. Distance is controlled: Mira's perceptual signature filters setting and objects through temporal nostalgia ("time was a river"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the visitor's "I can't understand the numbers anymore" and the young man's "I want to rediscover what we lost" carry subtext and advance plot. Register is consistent, though "suddenly timeless" appears in both the visitor's experience and the final line, creating minor convergence. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess; psychic distance modulates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Maren with strong perceptual signature (poet's attention to "woven dawns," "burnished hush"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the boy's "It's gone" and "My grandmother made that kite" carry subtext and advance emotional stakes. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the boy's confession. However, the final journal entry ("the divine breath moves through the cracks we'd rather seal") drifts toward elevated register that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-consistent with the grounded earlier narration.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren throughout, with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is selective and profession-specific: she notices mycorrhizal networks, copper wire patterns, limestone porosity. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening in the final week and the death scene. Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon (systematic, porous, fruiting bodies) without register drift. The prose carries a distinct contemplative texture with controlled rhythm ("stone and wood and flesh all speaking the same language"). Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The narrative confidence matches Maren's expertise; she interprets the orchard's changes through her caretaker lens without omniscient leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with psychic distance modulating purposefully (closer during confession, wider during scene-setting). Elara's perceptual signature—academic precision meeting embodied sensation—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Elara and Quorum carries subtext (the alien's "We have no word for this" underscores thematic divergence vs. convergence) and advances understanding without exposition dumps. Quorum's voice ("wind through bronze bells—that particular quiet that followed the ringing") establishes alien otherness without obscuring communication. Free indirect style is clean; diction remains within Elara's scholarly-experiential register.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance and tense remain consistent. The coachman's perceptual signature—recognizing seeds by touch, translating bird calls through ancient languages—is distinct and specific. Diction fits his practiced, semi-formal register. However, his interior voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("the familiar contradiction settle into his bones," "vastness of life emerging from the strict confines") that reads more authorial than character-particular. The spindle-beak "dialogue" in dead languages is purposeful but risks ornamental exoticism; it advances atmosphere more than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV via Calder is stable; Mercy's interior is filtered through Calder's perception ("her body remembered the work") without head-hopping. Diction is distinctive: "intuitively descriptive quality," "tinted revelations," "wild hush," "grooves worn into earth." The woman's recorded voice carries subtext ("the riddle isn't in the words, but in the listening") and advances plot. Calder's dialogue to Mercy ("Distance is what killed us") is character-specific and stakes-driven. Minor slips: "her spirit had retired from it" and "the sound of hundreds of feet moving together" edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the established voice, and the phrase "choosing to read the maps hidden in silence" in the final line borders on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited with tight focalization through Maya. Perceptual signature is consistent: astronomer's lens, attention to temporal phenomena, measured tone. Psychic distance is stable. Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("temporal topology," "probabilistic ghost"), though some phrases approach stock lyricism ("monument to abandoned ambition"). No dialogue. The final paragraph's "True north was wherever you stood when you stopped running from yourself" edges into thematic ventriloquism—Maya's articulation feels more like authorial thesis than her interior idiom under pressure. Otherwise, voice remains clean and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Kael's awe and regret. Dialogue between Kael and the guardian feels purposeful and advances confession and reframing. However, diction veers into elevated register ("apprenticed himself to wonder," "magnitude of what he was attempting," "sacredly playful") that reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but abstracted; we get poetic texture rather than Kael's specific noticing habits. The guardian's voice is distinct (ancient, gnomic) but brief. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the final image maintains voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Mira's historian lens ("spelled out the gestures," "benevolently ruthless in her documentation"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "nomadic penumbra," "unbinding of civilization visible in how they stopped saying 'please.'" The archivist's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent (Mira notices small gestures, absence, light through dust). Minor: some reflection edges toward thesis statement ("These small moments, she believed, were the true history") but remains anchored to her role and the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-philosophical register with strong perceptual signature: "dust that tasted of forgotten civilizations," "hidden thunder in people's hearts," "seed doubt over certainty." Psychic distance is stable throughout, and the elevated diction matches the focalizer's reflective, visionary nature. Free indirect style is clean; internal processing feels character-specific rather than generic. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully from contemplative opening to compressed urgency ("The stone grew hot enough to burn. The feather in her other hand began to smoke.") to expansive resolution. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not testable.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: chess variations, invisible strategy boards, counting broken warps. Distance is consistent. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—shorter clauses during the decoding, longer reflective passages as realization dawns. One minor slip: "fierce repose" as a phrase in the final paragraph feels slightly authorial rather than character-filtered, nudging the prose toward prompt-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara throughout, with distinct perceptual signature ("artist soul," ink-stained fingers, seeing prison where others see sacred ground). Dialogue carries subtext—the elder's "You corrupt the ritual" / "You conduct the ritual" echo-play is effective. However, some diction slips toward elevated register ("refracted through rhythm and rhyme, splitting into prisms of interpretation") that feels more authorial than character-rooted for a young artist in crisis. The narrative distance is consistent but occasionally explains what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Maya's perceptual filter (gears "groaning," air "reeking," charm as inherited text). Diction modulates under oxygen stress: short clauses in the surfacing beat, longer reflective syntax when the statue speaks through memory. The grandmother's quoted whisper provides idiom distinct from narration. Minor register drift: "dire enchantment," "quilting together," and "patient intervals" feel elevated beyond Maya's immediate voice during peak pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. Maren's perceptual signature—reading lives through gait and hand-holding, noticing "impossible geometry of light"—is character-specific. Diction stays within her register (painter's vocabulary, measured introspection). The reflection-heavy final section maintains clarity but approaches the edge of summary; the long concluding paragraph shifts from scene to exposition. No dialogue present (rightly so for a solitary journey). Sentence rhythm modulates well between action beats in the cave and contemplative passages, though the closing moves toward a more uniform, thesis-like cadence that slightly flattens voice under the weight of meaning-making.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV holds steady; psychic distance is controlled and Mira's perceptual signature (sensing "vibrations of intent," filtering through her grandmother's teachings) is distinct. The dialogue snippet ("Wait" / "How did you—" / "The vibrations of intent...") feels functional but slightly expository. Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling") are voice-appropriate and not overused. One slip: "Background said" is a textual error (likely "Mira said"), breaking immersion at a key beat. Prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure, and diction remains within Mira's idiom throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: navigation charts as fabric, corrosion as map, device-building as answer. The midnight caller's voice carries purposeful mystery without withholding facts Mara knows. Diction matches the technical-mystic register consistently ("temporal density," "gravitational well of shared history"). The phone dialogue advances plot through cryptic guidance that Mara interprets via physical engagement. Distance modulates appropriately from external observation to intimate interiority at the sternum-pull moment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person POV with stable distance and clean focalization through Mira's pragmatic lens. Diction is controlled ("storm-churned soil," "jagged confessions"). One register slip: "occlude painful memories" and "cultivating psychological safety" feel elevated for Mira's established voice as a forager-turned-dealer. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Henrik's plea carries subtext. Perceptual signature—mapping fungal networks, dismissing superstition—remains consistent. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and supports the reflective tone at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("observed the world by noting what wasn't there"). Diction matches Magnus's profession and temperament. However, several constructions drift into elevated literary register that sits above a working keeper's lexicon: "witnessed isolation," "opal dock," "borrowed memories" as abstract frame. The phrase "nautical twilight when the sun drowned beneath the horizon but still cast its ghostly glow upward" reads more like authorial mood-setting than Magnus's thought under pressure. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during chip examination, slightly elevated during the vision sequence to encompass multiple possible Martins). The prose carries a distinct texture: "empirically intuitive," "yellowed charts and crumbling cartography," "narcotic" rose fragrance. Perceptual signature is map-dealer specific—he recognizes the medieval bivium carving, reads the matrix chip's craft, interprets the ants' work through his understanding of adaptive systems. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean: "Tomorrow, he would open the shop again. But perhaps..." captures his tentative permission to hope. One brief register bump: "empirically, intuitively certain" in the final line reads slightly authorial, but remains within Martin's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated diction ("lacy with menace," "mountains dreaming," "geological time") matches the queen's regal remove, and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the grotto encounter. The grotto's anthropomorphized speech ("I am only what you summoned") maintains tonal consistency. Elision of the actual climb and the month of dreams is purposeful, compressing transit to focus on the confrontation. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, filtering through Solène's precision and reverence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity," "密度 of actually being here") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is functional but stilted ("Tell me what you've really been doing all this time" / "I've been trying to capture the density of presence")—characters speak thesis rather than pursuing goals with indirection. The prose has textural ambition (lyric cadences, image clusters) but the perceptual signature is generic alchemist-scholar rather than a distinct mind under pressure. Purposeful compression in the twilight imagery works, but the philosophical register undercuts immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance; narrative certainty matches Maren's compromised temporal access. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices ink-making detail, dream chronology, and scroll materiality. Diction stays consistent ("time was soup," "pack of strangers wearing her face") with occasional register drift into abstraction ("chronologically confused" reads more clinical than lived). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The opening elision (diagnosis details withheld briefly) is purposeful and paid off within 200 words. Rhythmic control holds under reflective pressure, though some sentences default to balanced clause structure ("She'd seen her grave and kept living. She'd forgotten her mother's face and remembered it").

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyric register that fits Elena's perceptual signature: "maps an emotional terrain," "evidence of ordinary miracles." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Mr. Chen's "trembling calm" and Elena's observations advancing both plot and subtext. One register friction: "purposeful ambiguity" and "conceptual repricing" feel slightly elevated beyond Elena's established idiom at peak moments. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose reflects Elena's mind—meticulous, interpretive, elegiac.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (scholarly precision, embodied fear, grandmother's voice) is consistent. Diction modulates under pressure: short syntax during crystallization, longer contemplative rhythms during rune-work. No head-hopping. The grandmother's voice is distinct from Mira's internal register. Free indirect style is clean ("She had dismissed those teachings…"). Minor template echo: "She was no longer afraid of storms" in the final paragraph is competent but slightly generic for the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct—"exorcist who worked in metaphor," "grief made tangible"—and the close third stays anchored to Margot's perceptual signature (professional vocabulary, metaphor-driven thought). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I know you're here, Vivienne"). The river-freezing metaphor and "induced currents" maintain idiom. Minor register drift: "emotional electricity" and "induced currents" occasionally feel like prompt-label carryover rather than fully inhabited diction. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the narration filters perception through Kael's training and mission. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that sits uneasily with immediacy: "reality spiraled inward on itself," "causality itself," "meaning unbound from language" lean abstract when embodied specificity would sharpen voice. The phrase "wanderingly exact" is used twice (once in narration, once as descriptor for "definitions") but feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the prose modulates with the Hiccup's arrival, but the perceptual signature lacks character-particular selectivity—Kael's way of noticing reads generic rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices mercury levels, hydraulic mechanisms, precise measurements filtered through her technical training. Diction remains voice-consistent ("eminently peculiar," "shepherd," "sang their true song"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the key-turning sequence, stepping back for the final reflection. No head-hopping. The prose carries rhythmic control under pressure: short fragments during the countdown, longer syntax for the conceptual realization. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in Maya's third-person limited perspective with consistent perceptual signature (mathematical metaphors: "water on stone," "probability governed everything"). Register generally matches her academic background, though "lucid contradictions" and the self-aware cataloging of paradoxes occasionally feel more like authorial observation than lived thought. The "clover" motif recurs purposefully, and the mica-distorted vision creates a distinct lens. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The final paragraph's summary mode ("ready to interpret a different kind of cryptic message") slightly flattens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third limited is stable with clear psychic distance. Voice is distinct ("cultivated estrangement," "melodically haunted") and modulates under pressure (protocol narration → wet-finger performance → quiet invitation). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("This is a wrong number. I meant to call my daughter"). Minor deduction: some diction ("DNA of a new hello," "psychic infrastructure") tilts slightly elevated for the operator's register under stress, and the phrase "melodically haunted by every conversation" in the performance paragraph feels more authorial than Sarah's direct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Maren's archivist lens filters everything through documentation instinct. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("We steep ourselves in leaving..."). Voice is consistent and textured ("specific sepia that made even new documents look ancient"). Under peak moment (returnees' arrival), diction stays controlled. Minor slip: "understanding was beginning to dawn like the stars" is a stock construction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent register ("rumor made flesh," "polite anarchy," "desperately jocular bark") that tilts literary-archival without breaching plausibility. Dialogue is minimal and functional—Emil's "harder to locate than credible information" and "bloody lonely" feel natural—but the group remains largely silent; we hear no negotiation or friction when they decide to stay. The narration occasionally over-explains ("that desperately jocular bark she'd perfected to deflect genuine emotion") where the gesture alone would suffice. Psychic distance is controlled, and diction is mostly consistent, though "catalyze" and "networkers" lean slightly corporate for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance remains stable in close third throughout, with Sera's perceptual signature (absorbing languages through skin, ultrasonic sensitivity) consistent and specific. Diction occasionally elevates beyond probable character lexicon: "conjugation of moonlight through leaves," "quiet blaze of recognition burned," "lexicon of bat-song" feels somewhat literary-precious for crisis perception. The prose modulates well with pressure (shorter phrases as she nears the stillpoint), and no head-hopping occurs. Free indirect style is clean, though peak moments lean toward lyric register that slightly tensions immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stable third-person limited with Mara's perceptual signature: "whispers and stutters of distant stars," "desperate need for order projected onto chaos." Diction remains voice-consistent ("confident uncertainty," "margin between drafts") and the narrator's certainty calibrates to what Mara can plausibly infer. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the discovery beat. Minor slips: "threshing meaning from experience" in the motivation paragraph feels slightly elevated for the internal moment, and "her station existed in the margin" shifts briefly toward external summary, though it recovers quickly. No dialogue to evaluate. The final line's tone—"confidently uncertain"—lands as character-specific closure rather than label.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with Marina as focalizer; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—visual focus, sign language as primary mode—is distinct and consistent. Free indirect style is clean ("She had spent so long feeling erased"). However, register drifts upward in several beats ("methodology remained," "transcendent," "disrupt the night with a voice more profound") into elevated diction that exceeds Marina's established lexicon under emotional pressure. Dialogue via sign language is purposeful and goal-driven, though brief. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Mara's perceptual signature—"analytically intuitive," precise academic habits—filters the cave description effectively. However, the interiority occasionally slips into abstraction: "volcanic tenderness erupting in tears" and "her motivation had always been specific" tell rather than show. No dialogue appears, so voice is tested only in narration. Psychic distance stays consistent, though the reflective passages sometimes flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV (Theo) maintains clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register: "causality itself seemed negotiable," "hush of the universe inhaling." Dialogue feels natural and advances the emotional turn. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the drumming sequence. One small slip: "This was the quietly rebellious act he'd perfected" reads slightly expository, naming the trait rather than letting action embody it fully. Overall, perceptual signature remains character-specific and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narration maintains stable third-person limited with Marcus as focalizer, using sensory detail filtered through his professional expertise ("His boots knew these paths better than his eyes"). Perceptual signature is strong: Marcus identifies people by gait rhythm, reads creases in maps, and translates storm interference into navigational data. The woman's dialogue reads slightly expository ("You proved it... calculated spontaneity") but remains within the bounds of a test administrator's role. Distance control is consistent, with no head-hopping. Minor rhythm monotony in some "Marcus [verb]" constructions, but voice remains purposeful and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV narration holds cleanly; Marina's perceptual signature (dental mirror, weaver lineage, close observation) creates distinct texture. Diction occasionally overreaches—"spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "teach darkness the value of stars"—into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound under stress. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. The guardian's silence is maintained without exposition leakage. Voice is purposeful and mostly controlled, with minor lapses into thematic phrasing at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Miss Chen; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, noticing footsteps by the philosophy section) is specific and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—Danny's disappointment ("That's it?") and Miss Chen's indirection ("I'm asking you to think freely") advance stakes without exposition. Psychic distance is stable; filter verbs ("heard it in his footsteps") are voice-motivated. Diction remains consistent with an educated chess coach's idiom. One minor slip: "forests of second thoughts" and "amplified quiet" read slightly elevated for conversational speech, but they serve Miss Chen's metaphorical framing. Voice modulates appropriately from reflective opening to the quieter, charged ending.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's perceptual signature is strong: "brutal tenderness," "balletic," "phantom weight" give her voice texture. Dialogue carries subtext—Kael's "That's mine" conceals longing, and Mira's "Pirates don't own things" tests him. Free indirect style is clean. However, elevated diction at peak moments ("understanding blooming like bioluminescence," "negotiated their ancient border") drifts above dock-worker register without voice motivation. Kael's interior access remains shallow compared to Mira's, but since the piece holds her POV throughout, this is appropriate. One minor filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("had always been," "had learned") is acceptable for scene-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Marcus; psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming in on his interiority during the whittling, pulling back to observe Emma). The narration habit—"I am now lifting the kettle"—is voice-particular and Marcus's perceptual signature (noticing the turbines' megawatts, the flowers' gray sameness) filters all detail. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Emma's flat "Dad, you don't have to do that" and her later "I remember" track her arc. Minor: the phrase "remade hush" and "unauthorized emotions" lean slightly explanatory rather than dramatized, a small distance wobble in an otherwise controlled voice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("lantern-moth circling flame," "verse-shadows"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("quantum states of meaning," "transformation's logic") that feels imposed rather than emerging from Meris's lived perception. Kael's brief dialogue is serviceable but his voice is indistinct from Meris's narration. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maya's texture-based perception; her colorblindness shapes what she notices (lighter shade of gray for the lily, values and contrasts). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression ("innocently cunning") and metaphor that fits her artistic lens. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with Tomás) but natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance remains close without intrusive filter verbs. The perceptual signature (texture, placement, subtle language) is distinct and maintained under pressure. One slip: "The phoenix's rising had scrambled something" reads slightly detached from Maya's direct knowledge, but the effect is minor and does not disrupt focalization elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices sonic texture, frequencies, and the "catches in breath before confession." Voice is controlled and purposeful, modulating from reflective backstory to present action without head-hopping. The volunteer remains exterior—his fear and softening are visible but not narrated from within, maintaining focalization. Minor slips: "powerfully gentle in her conviction" feels slightly authorial rather than filtered through Maren's self-perception, and the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("she finally understood") leans expository. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven ("Just stand here with me").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Mara's perceptual signature (blackened fingers, craft terms, astronomical framing) is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Senna's hesitation and Mara's gentle redirection carrying subtext. However, therapeutic diction intrudes at peak moments ("subdued ardor," "species of brokenness"), and some exposition explains rather than trusts dramatization ("something harder to name").

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV through Vesper is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, scholarly texture ("cultural archaeology," "labyrinths of connection") that fits her character but occasionally slips into exposition mode: "After the cryptocurrency crashes had wiped out the venture capital..." front-loads context rather than filtering it through present perception. Dialogue is functional and advances plot ("But why hide it in circuit diagrams?") but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom; Marcus and Vesper sound interchangeable in diction and rhythm. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the narrator's certainty about the grandmother's motives ("So she'd hidden her life's work") exceeds what Vesper could plausibly infer from diagrams alone.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated register ("atoms of nostalgia," "steadily unpredictable patterns") that fits the historian's scholarly background. Perceptual signature is selective (she notices geometry, emotional cores, the debate's structure) in character-specific ways. One register issue: "surrender to chaos while maintaining purpose" and "sublimation over survival" read slightly abstract for a character under emotional flood, though the surrounding embodied details (trembling hands, tears and laughter) anchor them. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. Diction remains within the historian's lexicon without unmotivated corporate or therapy-speak intrusions, though the philosophical vocabulary occasionally distances the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate steps," archive-professional lexicon. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("metamorphosed before her eyes," "saturated with luminous regret") occasionally drifts into elevated register during key beats, but the compression feels voice-motivated rather than template-driven. The rhythm modulates cleanly from expository beats to the decision moment. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight distance control; Elena's perceptual signature is consistent (scientific detail, self-critical assessment). The prose modulates appropriately: reflective in the backstory segments, concrete in present moments ("one eye rotating independently," "gold-green in the lamplight"). Dialogue to the chameleon feels voice-authentic for someone alone with animals. Minor slip: "shimmering stillness of the night" and "gentle wildlife handler" occasionally drift toward elevated diction, but the narrator's scientific lexicon largely holds. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Mara's perceptual signature: she notices root-knowledge, coffee sediment, scar layers. Voice modulates with pressure—early lyric drift ("patient and green") tightens into action at closure. No dialogue present; not applicable. Free indirect style is clean: "But how could she learn...?" blends narration and thought without filter clutter. One minor register slip: "accidentally telepathic" feels slightly convenient/modern against the otherwise mythopoetic diction. Psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping; single focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady throughout; Celeste's perceptual signature—sensory openness to "accumulated emotions clinging to every surface like static electricity," the layered psychometric vision—feels distinct and voice-motivated. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("celluloid amber," "spatially imaginative and impossibly layered"), though occasional elevated phrases ("benediction," "archaeologist") approach register drift without fully breaking the lens. No dialogue appears, so subtext and character-voice distinction are not tested. One brief elision: the letter's sender is "recognized from her grandmother's stories" but never named or followed up, a loose thread that does not harm momentum but slightly weakens closure integration.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Celestine; perceptual signature (hears unspoken words, dreams in coordinates) is character-specific. The Keeper's dialogue—"I was an artist once"—carries subtext of centuries of regret, though it edges toward expository confession. Distance control slips once: "she heard the words the universe itself wanted spoken" claims cosmic certainty beyond her focalization. Diction is elevated but consistent ("shadowed rapture," "painted breath"); no mid-paragraph head-hopping. One template stem recurs: "The [noun] [verb]" opens several sentences in the middle third without pattern-teaching, slightly dulling rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "charm not as magic but as persuasion," "the memory of trees, which in this new world amounted to the same thing." POV modesty holds (narrative certainty matches Maren's knowledge). The figure's dialogue ("In some timelines, it never stops burning") carries subtext and feels natural within the register. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains voice-motivated even when elevated ("wave functions," "superposition"), and the prose reflects Maren's perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV, third-limited. Perceptual signature is present: the philosopher notices mechanical sounds, categorizes frequencies, abstracts patterns. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("epistemology," "recursive algorithms," "mandala," "methodology") that feel authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Peak moments lean expository: "The sixth sense that had awakened in him wasn't mystical but deeply practical" reads as explanation rather than lived perception. Psychic distance is stable but lacks rhythmic modulation; syntax remains uniform across calm and revelation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance tightens during Mara's confession and final realization. Perceptual signature is present (leash "still warm," ticket punch "held twilight") but not strongly individuated—the diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the guides speak in parallel, nearly interchangeable cadence. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at key beats (confession, final image). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Rielle's perceptual signature (nerve sensations, architectural noticing). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate in physical sensation, wider when narrating the children's hiding. Silent-Choir's wordlessness is shown through gesture and action, not exposition. Deduction for one diction slip: "seraphically mundane precision" reads as author vocabulary rather than Rielle's stressed perception. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the anthem lyrics are integrated as cultural knowledge rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is controlled, elevated, and consistent: "regally unpretentious in his guardianship," "constellation-leather," "petrified lightning bolt." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature—Ossian's patient, timeless attention—feels character-specific. Diction stays within the focalizer's archaic-mythic register throughout. No head-hopping or filter clutter. The prose modulates appropriately at key beats (the pellet's arrival, the final inscription). Distinct and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature: Mara notices data patterns, instrument precision, and the reef through a scientist's lens. Diction is clear and mostly character-specific; "racing heart" is a brief cliché. The radio exchange feels natural and advances plot. Purposeful compression in the archival cross-reference paragraph is legible. Slip: "the rhythmic pattern she'd never understood" tells rather than shows her grandfather's habit acting on her memory; internal voice is consistent but leans slightly expository in the explanation of thermal memory rather than rendering discovery as friction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "that awkwardly confident gait," "thunderous serenity," opera glasses as lens. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific throughout. One brief elision—how she concluded the rebellion failed—is paid off on the page when the symbols crystallize her insight. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully as the hum envelops her.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance; Naja's perceptual filter is consistent (mineral-crusted rocks, sulfurous waters, iron-tasting air). The prose modulates under pressure: "The amber grew warm, then soft, then liquid" accelerates cadence at the unsealing. Diction mostly stays within her register—insurgent grandmother, ceremony-keeper—though "accidentally telepathic" and "genetic bridge their ancestors had prepared" feel slightly clinical for her voice. No dialogue present. The final paragraph's syntax shifts to declarative confidence ("already sensing which survivors carried the genetic potential") without the hesitation or embodied uncertainty her earlier interiority established.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature clear (Mira notices plants, light qualities, the body's involuntary responses). Diction remains within her lexicon except for minor clinical precision in "somatic markers" and "trauma specialist" framing. The dialogue with the couple is natural and purposeful, carrying subtext about resilience. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating from the morning's "economical and precise" movements to the resonant final paragraph. Brief register lift in "the body's involuntary 記憶" (Japanese character likely accidental) and some therapeutic vocabulary prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye for geometry, light, composition). The rhetorical questions function as stylized interiority consistent with someone interrogating their artistic crisis. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax as walls contract). Two frictions: filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy ("She understood now," "she saw it whole") when unmediated perception would sharpen the beat, and the elevated register ("transmuted into divination," "architecture of authentic sight") sometimes drifts beyond the POV's established idiom during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "serene anger," "consciously wild," "ephemeral maps of a mind trying to explain why being fully present felt like touching eternity." POV remains stable in close third, with narrative certainty matching what Kael knows; Vera's interiority is accessed only through observable speech and gesture. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven—Vera's "You understand" and Kael's "You're still a killer" carry subtext without over-explanation. Diction stays within Kael's frontier-tracker register; no filter-verb stacks or corporate drift. The prose modulates with pressure: syntactic compression in the cave confrontation without losing clarity. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices landscape and ink, filters sensory input through albino vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maren notices archive details (vault numbers, cryogenic systems, nitrogen frost) filtered through her role as archivist. Diction is controlled and purposeful with distinct texture ("the dizzying quiet," "slow suffocation of truth"). The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, tightening as she approaches the decision. No dialogue present to evaluate. One minor register slip: "scandalize the entire Concord structure" reads slightly elevated for the POV's internal texture in that moment, though it could be voice-motivated given her formal role.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent (she notices sand, scent, blade movements). Dialogue carries subtext: Kael's "culling" versus Mira's "patience," the lie about the magistrate. Voice is distinct: "cathedral-high," "tranquil blaze of sand," "kept weapons ready even in the only place that might be called home." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on Mira's hands, pulling back for the final image). Minor: "senselessly perceptive" is a brief narrator intrusion that slightly loosens distance, but the line recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable; Mara's perceptual signature (cool-headed fisher's patience, acoustic details filtered through her grandmother's teaching) is distinct. Diction stays consistent—elevated but voice-motivated ("achingly aware," "feral lullaby"). Purposeful compression ("by voicing silence, you create a negative space") reads as teaching passed down, not filter clutter. Minor wobble: "the goddess who transliterated all human feeling into the universe's fundamental frequency" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward explanatory summary, but the final beat recovers with image (walking home, carrying the echo).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the voice carries a consistent elevated register ("vaulted chamber," "sextants and astrolabes," "midnight between stars"). The observatory's echo serves as a purposeful device for her isolated reasoning. Psychic distance is controlled. Two deductions: (1) "devotedly observant" and "solemnly playful" are prompt-label intrusions that appear in exposition rather than emerging from scene action; (2) some interiority over-explains: "The Method was simple, really—proof by contradiction. Assume he was wrong..." reads as scaffolding for the reader rather than Celeste's natural thought process under pressure. Dialogue with Marcus is efficient but brief; no second on-page character to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Vera's perceptual signature: she notices "dissonance," "firmware," "algorithm"—academic diction consistent with her background. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close ("Vera's throat tightened") to slightly elevated lyric ("In the meteor hush of evening"). No dialogue appears; the curator's question and explanation are functional but lack subtext. The phrase "the firmware is haunted" in the letter and "meteor hush" at the end feel imposed by prompt rather than organic to Vera's idiom, creating minor register drift. Prose rhythm supports pressure without line-level opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "memories flaking away like old paint," "meaning-wheel" as reinvented vocabulary, sensory details filtered through Moth's social perception ("taste their panic"). The old man's dialogue feels natural and goal-appropriate. Diction stays consistent with Moth's artistic, perceptive lens. One minor slip: "the idea of faces, the echo of recognition" in the mandala description momentarily abstracts where concrete imagery would serve POV better, but it doesn't break distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Layla; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the augmented fingers tracing patterns and the retrocognitive vision. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("warm coldness, a gentleness edged in steel") that feels more authorial than character-grounded. The phrase "aberrant mercy" and "gentle radicalism" read as thematic labels rather than Layla's natural idiom under pressure. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines) but functional. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "midnight blue tasted like copper, silver chimed like church bells." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during synesthetic moments, wider during exposition. The narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with Margaux's theatrical background. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she understood," "she found") appear but do not dull immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Tense and stance hold across temporal layering without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV through Mara is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (light trails, fractally precise patterns) is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue between Mara and Chen feels natural and goal-driven, though Chen's lines lean expository ("Body-memories. The theory was..."). Minor register slip: "consciousness itself, transparent yet distinct" and "architecture of thought" drift slightly elevated during peak beats, yet remain within Mara's artist-technician lexicon and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person close POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Maren perceives "crimson anger bleeding through cracks" and "silver fear crystallizing." The prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("residual consciousness of a world before humans") that feels more essayistic than character-particular. Diction is consistent but tilts toward mystical register throughout, reducing modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears; the voice is coherent but lacks the syntactic variety that would sharpen peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature (her attention to chronometers, buttons, echoes). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Desta's single line of dialogue ("We're unscrambling history…") carries subtext and goal, though her voice is not tested against Mara's in extended exchange. Minor tension: the narration occasionally drifts toward elevated registry ("unearthed silence," "prophecy of human behavior") that slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon as an hourglass turner. The prose modulates well with emotional beats, compressing when urgency rises.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with controlled psychic distance. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "vouchsafe this information" and "metastasized, spreading through legitimate businesses" drift into elevated register during moments of urgency. Dialogue with Emma is minimal but functional; her "Show me" is crisp. The perceptual signature is somewhat generic (burned spy observing from isolation), and the prose occasionally moves into summary mode ("They worked through the night") rather than sustaining scene pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through the coachman with clean access to his perceptions and controlled distance to the woman (her actions and speech observed, interiority inferred). Voice is distinct: "spindrift serenity," "percolate through forced stillness," "ambient awareness" create a textured, slightly archaic register that fits a thirty-year veteran of ritualized crossings. Dialogue is natural and purposeful: the woman's explanation advances plot while revealing character; the coachman's sparse replies carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—tightens on the coachman's reflections, widens to observe the woman. Free indirect style is clean when rendering the woman's wonder and grief. No head-hopping; the coachman's lens holds throughout. Diction remains consistent under pressure (final exchange is economical, not overwritten).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single tight third-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the potter filters experience through her wheel-craft metaphors ("moment between collapse and form," "cracks in twice-fired clay"). Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits her observational stance. The beekeeper's dialogue—"You already know. You feel it in your clay"—carries subtext and advances understanding, though his voice lacks sharp differentiation from the narration's register. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mira notices angles, depths, light like a locksmith-gardener hybrid. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout ("wistfully pragmatic efficiency," "quivering hush"). Mrs. Chen's brief dialogue feels natural and advances Mira's internal arc. Psychic distance is controlled, moving inward for reflection on the gauge tooth and outward for spatial navigation. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. The prose carries a distinct texture (measured, nocturnal, technical) that modulates appropriately with Mira's focus shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("brittle glass breaking," "fierce, unprecedented independence"), though some constructions veer toward elevated register ("contemporary of extinct species watching the world forget her kind"). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on the page to assess. Perceptual signature is present (thylacine instincts layered with human thought) but not dramatized under stress. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Margot's perceptual signature (recognizing "the grammar of desire, the syntax of hope deferred"). Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Sena's dialogue ("Then rejoin us. Join yourself to this.") reads slightly elevated but serves the ceremonial moment. Minor slip: "inevitably whimsical, infinitely profound" in the closing lines shifts toward narrator commentary rather than filtered perception, though the drift is brief and the core voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-consistent. Diction is elevated but matches an astrophysics-trained DJ who interprets celestial signals ("ionosphere," "subsonic frequencies," "harmonics"). The perceptual signature is distinct: she notices vibrations that make her fillings ache, reads patterns others miss, and frames chaos as game mechanics. Under peak stress (lights flicker, weightless charts, vast scrutiny), syntax tightens appropriately without losing coherence. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and distinct ("shadowed nexus," "fallow period," "prudently adventurous"), though occasional register drift appears ("spatial mutiny" feels writerly rather than Mara's lived idiom). Perceptual signature is present: she notices "elegant precision" and "wistful beauty," filtering setting through an explorer's lens. The final paragraph's syntax ("Tonight, standing in that shadowed nexus between past and future") slightly elevates beyond her established voice under stress, but the effect is minor and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all perception through Elena's prosopagnosia (Morrison's face is "a blur," reporters' faces "meaningless"). The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated literary register—"lanced through sadness like light through glass," "furrowed hush"—that fits the retrospective, meditative tone. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Morrison's two quoted moments ("They can't remember her face clearly…" and "You gave her back to us") advance plot and charge the ending without naturalistic clutter. Distance remains controlled, though the narrator occasionally shifts into essayistic summary ("Her technique had always been paradoxical") that reads more like exposition than Elena's immediate thought.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice carries a speculative, academic texture appropriate to Mira's profession ("spongey dread," "wound-doors," "the world's membrane weakens"). Dialogue pursues goals—Mira persuading, Dr. Kao probing—and carries subtext in Kao's "nervously confident" observation and the final "someone should document this properly." Filter verbs ("watching," "observing") are acceptable within the reflective register. Minor slips: "the ancestor she'd barely known had led her to something else entirely" leans expository when the journals themselves are the active agent.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("dynamically observant by necessity") is declared but not consistently enacted; Mara notices the glass flake and scaffold pattern, yet her interior voice alternates between concrete observation and abstract philosophizing ("Luminous disbelief coursed through her veins"). The hitchhiker's dialogue ("We're all trapped in low resolution") carries thematic exposition rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Diction remains mostly consistent, though phrases like "quantum vibration of the mountain itself" drift into New Age register unsupported by Mara's established idiom as a working fiddler.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters sensory detail through Marco's ranger perspective ("dusky harmony," "perceptively calm"). The father's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("I'd marked myself too deeply" vs. Marco's "I've marked this territory"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully in the final beat ("something ancient and knotted began, finally, to loosen"). One deduction: "polished calm" and "perceptively calm" are used four times in close proximity as trait labels rather than shown through varied embodied cues, creating minor template echo.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Mara with clean section switches to include Elias's dialogue and collaborative perspective. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during the telegram moment. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("lucid dream chronicler," "stellar mapper") that fits the academic setting but occasionally drifts into Wikipedia voice ("Cepheid variables, eclipsing binaries"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elias's "Show me" and Mara's replies advance plot without strong subtext. No head-hopping, but the final paragraphs shift toward a collective "they" without individual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maren with consistent perceptual filter: "the old method her grandmother had taught her," "iron forged in stillness," sensory attention to wind and water. Diction is elevated but controlled—"warlike serenity," "unbend his rigid terror"—and fits the druid's formal register. The apprentice's dialogue ("I wanted to grow something that could consume lies") feels slightly expository but his whisper and shaking ground the moment. Maren's final dialogue crosses into authorial thesis ("they simply refuse to unbend from the shape their fears have locked them into"), a pocket of over-articulation in an otherwise clean voice. Psychic distance remains appropriate; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV through Mira remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the metaphoric diction ("root-bound," "scattered like dandelion seeds"), though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("recursive patterns," "convergence") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. Marcus's brief dialogue ("Link with me") pursues a goal but lacks subtext or distinct idiom. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance narrows appropriately during the climactic merge.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable through the Oracle's perspective with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve," seeing Marcus "inlaying meaning everywhere." Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("trammel souls," "the dangerous ways"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Marcus's "I'll pay anything to feel whole" foreshadowing the cost. Minor issue: the Oracle's internal narration occasionally tilts toward helpful-narrator mode—"The problem was, she'd let him"—which slightly over-explains causality the scene already shows. Purposeful compression in the orchard's whispered wisdom ("the trees whispered, their roots tightening infinitesimally") works well. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong (musician's vocabulary: feedback loops, reverb, speaker vibration). Voice modulates under pressure—recitation steadies trembling hands, then breaks into honesty. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Sarah's impatience drives the beat. Minor slips: "valley-deep with concern" is an odd metaphor for voice resonance, and the introspective monologue ("After the applause dies…") edges toward essay register, though it's anchored in the bottle-holding action and tracks Marcus's lexicon (stage, roadie, sound).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Emilia's trained, methodical perception. Diction is controlled ("anthropomorphism," "mineral-rich soil," "magnetic pathways") and fits her scholarly lens. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing defaults to visual description and abstract reflection rather than idiosyncratic bias. Some register drift toward expository summary ("the same patient method they'd always shared") flattens voice at a key beat. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets don't apply. Distance is consistent, but the prose lacks the rhythmic control or compression that would elevate this into the high band under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Maris; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: tactile focus (gear clicks, bamboo weave, molten metal), filtered through her fisherman-turned-keeper lens. Diction is controlled and lyric without straining ("serenity of winter sunlight filtering through ice"), though some constructions trend ornamental ("that particular peace of winter sun on snow—cold, clear, and somehow warm enough"). Dialogue is minimal, functional, goal-driven; the visitor's "I can't remember" and final laugh advance plot and carry subtext. Distance is stable; no filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Marcus's inspector lens colors all perception ("clinical detachment," "catalog these objects not as inventory"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices structural elements first, then emotional artifacts. Diction remains controlled and character-appropriate. The prose modulates effectively from professional assessment to emotional recognition without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "understood") appear but serve the gradual awakening rather than dulling immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as Marcus engages with the confession and artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable with Maya's hydrologist perception signature (flow rates, water quality, coordinates, sediment metaphors) filtering every observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during wading, wider during reflection—and the "daringly methodical" lens holds. The graffiti dialogue feels authentic and advances thematic pressure. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "raw and solace-seeking attention" and "testament to stubborn preservation," which elevate slightly beyond the POV's spoken idiom during crisis, but the voice remains coherent and the scientific precision anchors her particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through the veiled dreamer's perception. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("cautious exuberance," "cold fire," "architecture of their solitude"), though some phrases ("bloomed like cold fire," "recognition" as the deeper thing) feel slightly elevated beyond immediate embodied experience. The perceptual signature is consistent—she notices propagation delays, documents observations, and processes grief through her grandmother's lens. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. Voice remains distinct and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices through a researcher's eye (ice crystal structure, imperfections, timeline inconsistencies) blended with her accidental gifts (plant voices as italicized interiority, coffee-stain futures). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the coffee-reading and typing finale, slightly wider during plant communion. Two friction points: "around the same time she'd discovered she could read futures" is summary scaffolding that could anchor in a concrete first-use memory, and the plants' italicized speech occasionally tips into overt thematic coaching (*Propagate the truth. Seeds know how to break through concrete*) that feels like authorial voiceover rather than Elena's translation of their ache.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is lucidly watchful—Lyra notices aurora rhythms, temperature thresholds, pigment catch, each filtered through her dual-vocation lens ("beautician and mortician, twin vocations that had merged"). Diction remains voice-coherent under pressure: "skyborne sanctuary," "threshold of stillness," "radiant hush" carry a formal, ritualistic register without slipping into corporate or academic jargon. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets don't apply. Filter verbs ("watched," "recognized") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than automatic. One small register wobble: "lucidly watchful care" in the parents' departure feels slightly elevated beyond prior narration, but it's brief and doesn't disrupt the overall texture. Purposeful compression in the final beat ("That spark, that moment—Lyra had captured it. She always did.") accelerates to closure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Keiko's perceptual signature (grief carving hollows, climbing trees to think better). Diction is elevated but mostly consistent ("vineyard hush," "luminous with youth"); occasional register lifts ("that impossible length," "eternal guardian") read voice-motivated for the magical-realist frame. The woman's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("Still seeking?" "Tell me what you've learned") and subtext in her command-beneath-gentleness. Minor slip: "both and neither" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward authorial gloss rather than Keiko's lived thought. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows cleanly during the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third with Mara's perceptual signature evident in metaphor choices (cloak of doubt, hollow center). The keeper's dialogue feels natural and the "sincerely insincere greeting" phrase effectively characterizes his guarded warmth. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "welcome nuance into certainty" and "garment she'd finally learned to wear" read more polished than crisis-state thought typically allows. Internal voice stays consistent under pressure, and the throat-tightening moment embodies emotion well.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the researcher; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries distinctive texture ("sycamore hush—that particular autumn quiet when leaves hold their breath") and metaphor-dense idiom. Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that reads slightly external to the researcher's lived interiority ("cultivation," "harmonics that resonate with human consciousness"), and the student's voice lacks distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is present but leans heavily on metaphor rather than character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV distance is stable; Kael's perceptual signature (harmonic resonance vocabulary) is distinct and internally consistent. Diction remains within his contemplative, specialized lexicon throughout. The elevated register ("appraise," "harmonic matrices," "recursive geometries") fits his role without feeling forced. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Compression in the final two paragraphs maintains voice while accelerating cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady; Maren's perceptual signature (noticing the worthless keystone, the flickering magic metaphor) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the mist-walking attempts. Diction mostly fits her voice, though "perpetually twilit" and "luminance lingers" in the grandmother's journal shift slightly toward elevated register. No dialogue to judge. One slip: "accommodates impossibilities" and "brilliant dimness" are quoted/described but not fully dramatized in Maren's perception until the end, creating a slight filter-verb reliance ("she'd come to think of") early on.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Mara's perceptual signature favors maritime and memorial detail (brass lighter, iron stairs, tide charts). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("meteor hush ascent," "infinite dark score"). However, psychic distance wobbles: "her grandfather had hidden behind truth his entire life" and "These bottles were meant to signify his life's obsession" read as narrator summary rather than Mara's live inference in the moment. No dialogue on the page. The phrase "luminous vows" recurs but feels slightly imposed by prompt rather than organic to the character's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature—filtering cosmic collapse through mathematical prophecy—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You're still doing this?" / "Teach me"). Diction remains controlled; register does not drift into therapy-speak or corporate abstraction. Brief filter verbs ("she saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-POV third limited with stable psychic distance and a perceptual signature rooted in grief and reaper detachment ("distant intimacy"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "jewel of perfect grief," "echo of understanding." Free indirect style is clean. Two minor slips: "if she still possessed such a thing" reads slightly hedged, and "the terrible weight of mercy" in paragraph one risks abstraction, though both remain within the established register. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Elision of Daniel's discovery scene is purposeful, compressing backstory to foreground present reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV remains stable in close third, tracking Emris's perceptual signature (he notices dripping rates, barnacle letters, consistency over intensity). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful vocabulary ("tepid middle ground," "consecrated bowls"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (tighter during reconstruction, wider for context). Minor register drift in phrases like "cosmic imbalance" and "plausible impossibility," which edge toward prompt-speak, but the effect remains mostly clean.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV stays anchored to Marcus with stable distance; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("mirrored hush of his own wonder," "sapphire-hued liqueur label") with occasional register lifts ("expunge everything back into silence") that read voice-motivated rather than intrusive. Eleanor's dialogue ("Precisely humane, my father used to say") carries distinct idiom and contrasts with Marcus's internalized, observation-focused syntax. The piece maintains textural coherence under emotional pressure, though some phrases ("the geography of lives once lived") trend toward writerly gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: Lyra notices alchemical particulars (vials, brass burner, seven elements) and beauty-in-formulas. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ancient freshness," "living calligraphy"), though some phrases approach purple ("electric sense of standing at the threshold of truth"). Filter verbs are minimal. No head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the work scene. One slip: "that legendary reagent said to exist" introduces vague attribution where Lyra's own knowledge would be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Vera notices light patterns, muscle memory, the buckle's edges biting skin—details filtered through her observer role. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Command's measured "Walk me through your notation system again" carries subtext of potential belief. Psychic distance remains stable throughout. Minor slip: "soundless echo" in paragraph three reads slightly precious for the established voice, though it recovers quickly. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Close third-person POV remains stable on Kira; psychic distance is controlled, with interior access ("the words ash in her mouth") consistent and character-specific. Diction is purposeful—"vivify," "neural tissue," "quantum foam"—and matches a post-ego-death philosophical mindset without register breaks. Dialogue carries subtext ("We can't both raise her" is also "I want her"; "Then your fire melts me" is both threat and plea) and distinguishes the two voices through stance rather than heavy dialect. One minor slip: "Master Chen taught us" arrives as expository aside rather than dramatized memory, briefly flatting the voice. No head-hopping; elision (details of the meditation accident) is purposeful and paid off through present-tense cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV stays consistently anchored to Martin until Sarah's arrival, when focalization widens slightly but remains controlled. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Martin hears absence, filters the tunnel through musical metaphors despite admitting he's not musical. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Show me" / "Tomorrow?"), carrying subtext of shared need. The phrase "mournfully eager" recurs as a descriptor for Martin's steps, which feels slightly self-conscious but remains voice-consistent. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance compresses appropriately during the shared ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Maris notices through a blend of animal instinct and scholarly memory. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "foggy lucidity that characterized this realm" and "coherent singularity of her own existence" drift toward elevated register that slightly clashes with the feral POV under peak pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The prose texture is distinct and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is alchemist-specific ("stoically sensitive fingers," feeling "dormant pulse"). Narrative distance modulates purposefully—closer during the mixing ritual, wider during reflection on her father. Diction remains consistent to an educated practitioner's lexicon without register breaks. Psychic distance shifts intentionally: "a frozen bloom of emotion she rarely permitted herself" compresses to close observation. The prose reflects Cassia's analytical mind through precise technical detail (moonstone powder, bone ash, geothermal vents) balanced with metaphoric perception. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "serenely electric," "throat of darkness," "blueprint of silence" create a consistent idiom blending technical and lyrical registers. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (short sentences when she finds the pocket of quiet, more expansive at the epiphany). Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "fantasy practicality" appears as a concept label in the penultimate paragraph, nudging toward tell rather than embodied demonstration, but overall voice remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited on Mateo holds cleanly with no head-hopping; perceptual signature (the way he reads starlight patterns, reassures passengers) is character-specific. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("We need to merge the timelines") but lacks subtext or tension—Torres agrees instantly, passengers are reassured without doubt. Diction is controlled and matches the fantastical-realist register; no filter-verb stacks or tense slips. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose voice is competent but not distinctive under pressure; peak beats (holding the hourglass, entering the confluence) read cleanly but without rhythmic intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Marina's professional lens ("fever dream architect," "rational enchantment"). Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads the gallery through therapeutic design principles and recognizes consciousness vibrations in the sinew thread. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "where logic and impossibility married to birth healing" and "the peace of accepting that nothing remains as it was" read more polished than urgent. Psychic distance stays controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice carries a meditative texture appropriate to the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Carta's professional lens—her perceptual signature reads light and geometry with navigational specificity. Psychic distance modulates effectively when she watches the chain link pulse: "understanding flickering at the periphery of her comprehension" captures both closeness and epistemic struggle. Dialogue between Carta and Current-Through-Stones is functional and advances the teaching beat, though the alien's exposition ("The light remembers its origin. We follow the remembering.") trends toward convenient clarity rather than productive opacity. Minor register drift: "balancedly curious observation" and "somber marvel" read slightly elevated for the narrative voice under pressure, and the phrase "unfolded horizons" recurs without syntactic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "the shape of concern, the texture of warning" and "edges like broken glass"—sensory metaphors filtered through her professional lens. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lily's whisper and Mira's calm responses ("Your grandmother is very persistent") feel natural and goal-driven. The opening simile ("twilight poured through the glass ceiling like spilled ink") and the closing image (grandmother's love "crackling through corroded circuits") demonstrate rhythmic control and purposeful compression. Free indirect style is clean. However, "reeling hush" appears only once and does not modulate across the piece, limiting tonal range under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance controlled and perception filtered through Mara's professional focus (instruments, sensors, codex). Diction remains consistent—technical but not clinical—and the narrative voice modulates appropriately under pressure ("fighting the compression," "couldn't leave, not now"). However, several lines deploy elevated register that slightly exceeds the moment's urgency: "invisible things that left traces only during specific phase transitions" and "consciousness given temporary form during the liminal moment" read more like authorial summary than Mara's embodied thought. No head-hopping, and the phrase "information ghosts, Kove had called them" anchors the concept in character knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Mira's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent; the heartbeat-counting tic and Chen's remembered aphorisms anchor her interior texture. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is managed cleanly. One small register slip: "defragmentation algorithm" and "pattern-recognition software" feel slightly elevated for the exhausted, grief-driven mindset at 3 a.m., though they remain plausible given her role as assistant. Compression under stress is handled well (the counting quiets by dawn).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is tactile and pattern-focused: "copper-veined hands," "fingers read the bone's story," birds as "murmurations" of language. Diction remains elevated but voice-coherent ("quietly articulate in a tongue no ear could hear"). No head-hopping. Elision of the translation night's duration is purposeful compression that serves accumulative momentum. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maya; no head-hopping. Diction is mostly controlled ("frostbitten hope incarnate," "voices...not quite human, not quite wind"), though "cosmic absurdity" and "cognitive contamination" veer toward abstraction in a peak beat. Old Marrow's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("crackling like autumn leaves"). Filter verbs ("thought of," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. Narrative distance tightens appropriately as Maya's certainty fractures. Minor: "gravitationally playful artifacts" reads slightly over-wrought for the POV's present stress level.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Mira's perception. Voice carries a lyric register appropriate to the fairy-tale-inflected world: "fruit that tasted of starlight," "tarnished wonder." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the playing sequence. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "uprooting the very foundation of fear," "eternal space between the chrysalis and the wing." These phrases, while thematically coherent, lack the specificity of Mira's embodied voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans poetic-universal rather than character-particular under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (Maren notices the drone's whir, the carousel's shadows, the bottle's crackling) and reflects her professional vigilance. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some phrases ("fostering connections the borders were designed to sever") drift toward elevated register that feels slightly authorial. The piece sustains a coherent narrative stance throughout, and the shift to Samir's brief presence is handled cleanly without head-hopping. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in the carpenter's perception throughout. Voice carries a consistent lyric texture ("voices marking time in a way clocks never could," "whispering quality," "blessing") that fits the contemplative mood. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels external ("translation of ruin into revelation") rather than embodied in the carpenter's working mind. The perceptual signature is present (he notices curves, joints, spirals, light) but lacks idiosyncratic bias or edge. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Purposeful compression in the lyric mode is legible and taught early, meeting the experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; Cordelia's perceptual signature is scholarly and particular (topology, Lobachevsky, hyperbolic planes). Diction matches her POV ("sanely eccentric," "documentarian," "membrane of ordinary space"). One brief dialogue exchange ("Do you feel that?") serves witness function without subtext demand at this length. Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close on scarf memory, mid-distance on patrons). No head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the walk ("The air thickened. The lamplight bent strangely.") charge the climax. Free indirect style is clean. Voice is distinct but leans into elevated register throughout, which fits character yet risks monotony under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters detail through Mara's librarian-searcher lens: "tides of solitude," "luminous absence," light frequencies matched to paint hues. The prose carries a lyric, painterly texture consistent with the premise, and psychic distance tightens appropriately in the cave scene. However, some sentences drift toward committee voice—"The whispering archipelago kept its secrets, but it also offered invitations"—and the final paragraph's summation ("she had a different kind of collection to maintain now") reads as helpful-narrator over-explanation rather than trusting the image. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not applicable. Perceptual signature is strong in the overlapping-light observations, though a few lines ("dissolved like mist") approach stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Mara. Psychic distance is controlled, and the locksmith's voice ("You already have the key") carries distinct cadence. However, the prose drifts into elevated diction incongruent with Mara's fear-state: "across the hush of cosmic possibility," "envelope themselves in layers of fear." Under peak stress (the nexus spinning), Mara's perception is summarized ("disorientation washing through her") rather than shown through fragmented syntax or sensory breakdown. Dialogue advances plot but leans expository.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Vera's professional filter shaping perception ("her folklorist's training guiding her hands"). Diction balance is strong—scientific vocabulary (sediment, luminescent spores, fungal networks) blends with sensory immediacy. The retrospective framing ("This was when habits broke") maintains appropriate psychic distance. One register wobble: "become legend, became the kind of folktale she'd spent her life collecting" feels slightly too self-aware of the meta-narrative position, though it stays within her professional perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third limited holds steady with the archivist's perceptual signature (backward walking, shard-mirror collecting, decades of annotation practice). Dialogue carries distinct idiom: Finn's combative shorthand ("That's garbage") versus the archivist's patient exposition. Free indirect style remains clean. One brief dip: "the way he insulted her methods while desperately seeking her approval" reads as authorial diagnosis rather than filtered perception. Otherwise voice modulates appropriately from action to reflection without head-hopping or register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, folkloric texture ("spider silk," "dawn had barely touched the mountains"). Perceptual signature is present but not sharply distinct—diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("galleries of color where wonder grew wild") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and focalization remains controlled throughout, though the peak weaving sequence could anchor more concretely in Mara's physical sensation to sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and professional: Maren notices "resistance—not physical, but something deeper" and hears names "like a caught breath finally exhaled." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You know why I've called you"). The fisherman's voice modulates from "hollow echo" to clarity, supporting the arc. Diction remains consistent and accessible; free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance tightens during the ritual without filter-verb clutter, meeting the 9+ quick test for distinct signature and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct and professional: Maren notices angles, fault lines, cartographic tears, cross-references survey maps. Diction is controlled and purposeful, balancing technical precision with atmospheric texture. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (zooming into fresco quadrant, tracing cracks with her finger). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One minor register drift: "shielded openness that had served her well in delicate restoration work" feels slightly expository, but the phrase is brief and does not recur. Prose rhythm reflects the character's methodical mind without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable and controlled; Elena's perceptual signature is distinct (methodically working by untangling threads, quietly analytic). Diction fits the technical-introspective register consistently. The whispered dialogue to the skeleton and brief interior voice feel natural. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming from wreck-scale to snow globe interior). One minor slip: "the physics of letting go" as repeated phrase borders on thesis-statement rather than character thought, though it remains within Elena's established intellectual register.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Moth as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder," "breathless moment between lightning and thunder"), but elevated diction occasionally drifts into decorative register ("purposeful encryption," "quantum threads") that feels imposed rather than Moth-particular. Perceptual signature is present—Moth notices symbolic patterns, hums forgotten ballads—but interiority often summarizes rather than enacts thought under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tighter during the goggles revelation, wider during elevator transit). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices "fragments of light," "routine sorrow," details filtered through a servant's attentive gaze. Diction stays within her register except one slip—"seeking out the joy beneath anguish" in the diary excerpt reads slightly elevated for an airship captain's practical voice, though it's framed as encrypted text. No dialogue appears. Narrative certainty matches what Maren can plausibly infer from the diary through the goggles.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV, stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices through meteorologist's lens ("barometric reading," "electromagnetic signatures") inflected by personal loss (grandfather's telescope, cirrostratus at his death). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive quality," "dusty starlight." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure. One minor slip: "she could only describe as anticipation" is a filter phrase that slightly dulls immediacy, though it reads voice-motivated. Prose rhythm reflects the suspended, contemplative state without becoming static.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable throughout; the close third locks to the artist's tactile, pattern-seeking perception consistently. Perceptual signature is distinct: "all faces were geometric arrangements, pattern-sets without identity" filters every observation through her condition. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (artist, mathematician, sensory thinker) with purposeful elevation at closure ("fractally precise documentation of touch across centuries") that reflects her synthesizing insight rather than register drift. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor deduction: some filter verbs ("She'd accepted," "She'd found," "She understood") where unmediated perception would sharpen immediacy, though the reflective mode justifies many of them under BRR expanded allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Celeste's perceptual signature (curious, pattern-seeking, cautious). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("sociable isolation," "sky-sickness," "dog-eared corner"). The prose reflects Celeste's mind under rising pressure with appropriate modulation. No dialogue present to judge. Minor slip: "the starlings outside suddenly scattered" at the climactic realization feels slightly convenient as an external correlative; the causal link is metaphorical rather than motivated, creating a brief break in POV modesty (Celeste cannot know the scattering is a "secret someone had decided to stop keeping").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Miren notices "gear teeth meshing," "orange moss" rust, mechanical particulars. Diction remains controlled—"temporal mechanic," "clockmaker's gear assortment"—without register drift. Interiority anchors in present stimuli (frosted window, toolkit clasp). No dialogue; no penalty. Rhythm modulates: longer lyric passages during descent and reflection, shorter beats during gear work ("The first gear slipped into place with a satisfying click"). One minor template risk in "She'd come to learn" construction, but voice texture—specific metaphors (driftwood, shed skin), technical vocabulary—holds distinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Mara's three-hundred-year perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: she observes with patient, mission-driven clarity. Dialogue (Joren, Elissa, Kessa) feels natural and goal-driven, with distinct idiom per speaker. The line "brambled hope" in narration reads as purposeful diction, matching Mara's seasoned voice. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("watched," "admiring") appear but do not dull immediacy. The prose carries a consistent, measured texture appropriate to a ghost with centuries of experience.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to her interiority. The voice carries a formal, elevated register—"bruised awe," "vouchsafe," "hush of time's final ripple"—that remains coherent but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical diction ("mathematical poetry underlying causation") during emotional beats. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext cannot be judged. The perceptual signature is present (she sees nested patterns, fractal repetitions) but the lexicon feels more authorial than character-particular, especially in peak moments where embodied compression might sharpen the voice. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") are present but not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, filtering the orchard through Maren's reluctant expertise—"graceless beauty," "ugliness and purpose intertwined"—without head-hopping. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "bleeding orange" and "dying light" verge on stock. The couple's dialogue ("The birds," the woman gasped) is functional but generic; Maren's single line of dialogue ("Follow me") carries goal-driven purpose but no subtext or character idiom. Psychic distance is consistent; the narrative voice modulates slightly with rising urgency (shorter clauses as the birds descend) without losing coherence. No filter-verb stacks or POV leakage mar the execution, and the perceptual signature—seeing coordinates in nuts, reading shadows—is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Maya's perceptual signature is distinct—scientific metaphors (polymerization, molecular chains) blend with musical perception (symphonic patterns, rhythm) in a character-specific way. The prose modulates appropriately under emotional pressure without losing her voice. Minor issue: "the grief that moved through her felt like something she could live within—loose, flowing, finding its own complicated path" reads slightly over-articulated for a moment of felt experience, edging toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register that suits the fantastical premise. Vera's perceptual signature—quantifying absence, measuring silence—is consistent. The customer's single line of dialogue ("I need to find the place where stories begin. Before the bad chapters. Before I became what I became.") reads more like thesis statement than natural speech under pressure. Vera's exposition about her trade and the parole band's meaning dominates the middle, flattening narrative distance into tutorial mode. Psychic distance remains consistent but the voice does not modulate with urgency; the transaction proceeds at the same reflective tempo throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in close third; distance modulates purposefully (tighter during touch, wider during explanation). The perceptual signature is consistent—chef's analytical lens applied to memory work, chemistry, pattern-reading. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven; Amira's "You feel it too" and backstory exposition serve plot efficiently. Voice carries a distinct lyric-technical texture: "contagious, spreading through his fingertips like frost." Minor slips: "Moran" appears once (typo for Maron), and some reflection borders on over-articulation ("touching, tasting, smoothing" reads slightly mechanical).

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("hush of borrowed starlight," "empathetically decisive," "calcify further into isolation"), reading as a narrator slightly above Mara's register yet anchored in her choral/curatorial expertise. The phrase "empathetically decisive because she had to be" and "construct bridges from their isolation" veer toward prompt-label echo, but the narration integrates them as reflection rather than dialogue, mitigating the intrusion. Perceptual signature is clear (she hears rhythm, catalogs by harmony), and the prose modulates from lyric stillness (tower work) to vigorous action (descent, attachment) without losing coherence. Brief dialogue (farmers singing along) is natural and goal-free, serving atmosphere rather than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Voice exhibits purposeful density and elevated register ("entangle," "synaptic plasticity," "archeologist excavating the future") that fits a scientist-protagonist in reverie mode. However, diction drifts into corporate/academic abstractions ("neural cross-contamination," "methodology was sound") and the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. The piece withholds the canyon's significance for dramatic suspense ("somehow knew without knowing") rather than letting Elena's expertise shape what she notices. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, distance controlled, and the narrative voice carries a consistent texture of archival curiosity and wonder. The perceptual signature—"prism mind refracted them all"—is distinctive, though the metaphor is more told than shown in sentence-level rhythm or fragmented perception. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The piece uses purposeful compression in the inversion sequence and the final paragraph's future summary is voice-consistent. Minor register elevation ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") fits the scholarly tone without breaking POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; Maren's perceptual signature is consistent (she reads bark as "frozen symphonies," stress cracks as "intervals, harmonies"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "liminal moment," "symphonically minded," "empathy in motion" fit the character's artistic vocabulary without register drift. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance narrows smoothly during the performance sequence. One minor friction: "impossibly" at the birds' return briefly introduces authorial certainty about what should be possible in this world, a small POV leak. Otherwise, the prose reflects Maren's mind and state throughout, and rhythmic control under pressure (the cascading performance description) is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Kavir with clean psychic distance; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is specific—chess player's pattern-seeking, exile's learned receptivity, thumb finding the dent—and modulates under pressure when he "emptied his mind of strategy." Dialogue is spare but purposeful: the daughter's "You came" and Kavir's correction "Not invalid… Incomplete" carry subtext and advance plot. The prose rhythm breathes appropriately (short sentences during the silence-listening, longer syntactic structures in reflection). Minor filter-verb presence ("he'd learned," "he'd sought") stays voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. Diction remains within Kavir's scholarly register without jarring academic intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable (single focalization, third-limited on Marlow). Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("the amber hum of childhood summers," "fertile quiet of understanding") that modulates under pressure without breaking register. Dialogue (Marlow's transmission to the microphone) feels purposeful and voice-specific, advancing her shift from demand to witness. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices frequencies, textures of silence, and the workshop's sensory particulars. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she had learned," "she had discovered") in backstory does not materially dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric-herbalist texture: "wildflower hush," "petals falling through leaves," "architecturally strange." POV remains stable in close third with appropriate knowledge boundaries. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during reflection without head-hopping. The grandmother's voice in the doodled paper and whispered encouragement differentiates briefly but effectively. One minor slip: "the turning of the tide's thought" phrase appears in both Mira's journal and the narrative frame without clear attribution, creating momentary distance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara's perceptual signature—navigating by water flow, feeling "whirling silence," tracking irrigation channels—creates a distinct professional filter. Psychic distance remains stable throughout. The prose carries a measured, observant rhythm ("That was the only way to describe the phenomenon") that modulates during the Inversion without losing coherence. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. The phrase "discover the truth written in their movements" leans slightly expository, but the focalization remains tight to Mara's real-time observation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with investigator-specific perceptual signature: technical vocabulary (anemometer array, pressure differentials), systematic observation patterns, and immediate translation of sensory data into causal hypotheses. Distance control is consistent, though the final paragraph shifts slightly toward retrospective omniscience ("understanding finally what he'd been cultivating"). Chen's brief dialogue reads functional and the radio crackle provides clean transition. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately between technical documentation and emotional weight at the patch moments. One weakness: "systems revealing their hidden architecture" reads more like thesis than character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Mira's synesthetic perception. Diction is purposefully elevated ("pregnant pause between heartbeats," "oscillating repose") and consistent with the lyric-accumulative mode. Register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("wonder regulated heartbeat, that awe oxygenated blood") that feels more authorial than character-grounded. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("she hadn't saved the bells... had saved them all") reads as helpful-narrator syndrome, over-explaining what the image already conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (monastery-trained, reverent) but not highly distinctive. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("avalanchingly quiet," "purposeless, a beautiful cage for silence") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the flute-playing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured with purposeful compression ("sugar in rain," "honey, then sudden and sharp as shattering ice"). POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic across beats; the operator's borrowed personalities do not alter syntax or rhythm in distinguishable ways. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lucid turbulence," "residual divinity") without POV-specific anchoring, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through Kael. Voice carries distinct texture in phrases like "slipped into myth-telling, the way the old do" and "geometric proofs of beauty." Dialogue feels natural and advances plot, with the Keeper's lines particularly strong in subtext. However, the Keeper's extended exposition block shifts into essay register ("They germinate wonder in the spaces between...") that feels more like authorial thesis than character speech. Psychic distance remains controlled except during this explanatory passage. The merchant and shepherd voices lack sufficient distinction from each other, though both differ from Kael's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena; psychic distance is controlled and diction fits her academic lens ("confirmation bias," "dendritic patterns"). Hartley's dialogue carries distinct vulnerability ("truthful lies," paradox as character signature) and his speech differs from Elena's more measured tone. The phrase "shifted hush" recurs but reads slightly precious against the otherwise grounded prose. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elena's trained eye, mystic framing) and the voice modulates appropriately under emotional weight without collapsing into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mariko. Perceptual signature is consistent—craft-focused, stoic, attentive to texture and intention. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gossamer," "liminal," "translucent") that fits the mythic atmosphere but strains against the grounded craft details. No head-hopping. The grandmother's exposition in reported speech feels slightly formal but remains within bounds. Psychic distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature tied to Mira's forge-craft vocabulary ("each strike measured and deliberate," "coax resilience from rubble"). Dialogue with the magician feels natural and carries subtext ("You're not meek at all" / "I'm quiet. That's different"). Minor filter-verb presence ("understood," "knew") doesn't dull immediacy. Diction remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. The prose reflects Mira's methodical focus without compression under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—sensory mapping vocabulary ("temperature gradients blooming like flowers," "taste of copper") stays consistent under pressure. Dialogue with Mira carries subtext (the static and distance underscore separation) and advances plot by revealing the convergence. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments. No head-hopping; Mira's form is filtered through Kael's sensation rather than accessed directly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera's perception; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during her reading, slightly pulled back during Marcus's collapse, intimate again in the lantern room). Diction is controlled: "warmly observant attention," "luminescent ache," "frozen chrysanthemum" fit Vera's careful, image-attuned voice. Marcus's dialogue carries subtext: "Ships need… need to know they're safe" expresses his own need through the vessels he protects. Perceptual signature is consistent: Vera notices the sea glass's "weathered perfection," the cairns as "small graves," the Fresnel lens catching "last purple light." No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she thought," "she realized") appear but don't dull immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering lighthouse mechanics and storm through Kael's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent—"shadowed elation," "temporal uncertainty," "refracted truth"—creating a distinct narrative texture. The prose avoids head-hopping and the register suits the otherworldly premise. However, under peak pressure (light erupting, dawn arriving) the voice does not modulate; it maintains the same lyric remove, missing an opportunity to vary psychic distance. No dialogue appears. One brief filter-verb cluster ("he could see lightning fork") slightly dulls immediacy but does not materially harm distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature (heartbeat awareness, physical anchoring) is consistent and specific. Chen's dialogue carries subtext and advances the teaching relationship; his lexicon (sun trails, architectures, pattern recognition) is distinct from Mira's more visceral framing. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during Mira's embodied reactions, wider during Chen's exposition. One filter-verb cluster ("feeling," "thought of," "seemed to possess") in the opening third slightly dulls immediacy but does not break voice. No head-hopping, and the rhythm tightens slightly at the close without losing the valley-mist register.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature ("what trees witness" frames her curiosity; "she'd discovered it could measure something else entirely" reflects her professional precision). Diction fits a maintenance worker with poetic sensibility ("Dreams accumulated in corners, pooled in dead ends, crystallized on leaves like dew"). Minor slips: "quantified sorrow: precise measurements of longing, loss, hope deferred. Three units of grief here, seven of yearning there" edges toward tell-not-show and repeats the concept without deepening it mid-paragraph. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from task-focus to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elora's alchemical perspective. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent: "amber ghosts," "perpetual darkness," "borrowed starlight." The prose modulates well under pressure—short clauses during the weaving, longer periods in reflective beats. Two minor slips: "what passed for years in a place where time moved sideways" drifts into helpful-narrator explanation, and "mirrors of her own searching expression" briefly externalizes what she cannot see. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("feeling the hum," "watching the faces") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Iris. Perceptual signature—"compassionate distance," noticing customers who "seemed to be waiting without waiting"—is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext in the woman's "not asking" observation and Iris's whispered admission. Two slips: the phrase "enlarged tranquility" reads as authorial rather than Iris's lexicon, and "nestled paradoxes made architectural" shifts into elevated register briefly. Filter verbs ("watching her reflection") remain voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV (Mira) is stable with distinct perceptual signature: she notices absences, keeps records, tracks patterns others dismiss. Diction is controlled and literary without register breaks. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Not covering. Transforming."). However, some phrases verge on elevated poeticism that slightly exceed Mira's established voice under pressure: "heuristically gentle," "embodied every perfect loaf," "defying season and sense" read slightly authorial. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (detecting frequencies only she can hear, fountain pen despite cold). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "gently meticulous," "quartz hush," "luminous vows once bright, now cooling toward absolute zero." Occasional elevated register ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") feels slightly authorial but remains within a solitary archivist's internal lexicon. No dialogue to judge. Narrative certainty matches what Maren can know through her instruments and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Nelle's perceptual signature (time measured in moonshine runs, silence as survival) is voice-particular and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Crenshaw's "Your daddy was a good man who made bad choices" / Nelle's correction "He made one good choice at the end" advances conflict economically. One register wobble: "curiously steadfast despite the flutter" and "comforting unease" feel slightly authorial rather than fully filtered through Nelle's idiom under stress. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in Mira's perceptual signature—metallic wind, cardamom-sweet brother, lime revelation. The taste-based perception is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot ("You're still wearing that useless thing" / "It's teaching me"). However, voice convergence appears in the final paragraph: "simultaneously ancient and impossibly new" carries elevated diction that feels authorial rather than Mira's established register. Kael's internal shift ("his storm clouds began to dissipate") is narrated with certainty beyond what Mira could observe, bordering on omniscient leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "Years of sketching strangers in the subway had left permanent shadows beneath her nails, gray crescents that marked her as surely as any brand." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the discovery and drawing. POV remains stable in Elena's third-person limited perspective; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the drawing montage ("The businessman became a phoenix. The tired nurse grew flowers from her hair") accelerates without losing clarity. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One hairline slip: "auroral sorrow" as a descriptor in the opening feels slightly elevated beyond Elena's established idiom, though it's narratorial rather than directly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent literary register with purposeful compression ("Days blurred into weeks"). The dialogue with the elderly woman feels slightly expository ("Your grandmother understood that candor in small moments...") but serves to anchor the thematic question. Perceptual signature is present in Mira's noticing of text and physical responses to dishonesty. Distance control is clean, and the final lines maintain voice under pressure without drifting into therapy-speak or over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—technical musical terms, attention to calibration and atmospheric shifts—and diction stays within Mira's professional idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during the chest-tightening moment, opens for the pilgrim scene). No dialogue to judge. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats without filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with a distinct perceptual signature: "corroded their circuits like rust," "fragmented wholeness," "these impossible things" all reflect M4-RY's dual nature. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority during the chest-panel revelation, slight zoom-out for the sensor chime. Diction remains within android-caretaker lexicon: "neural network," "processors," yet poetic ("mineral hearts pumping something that resembled sap"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose compresses under pressure (short declaratives during the miniaturization) then breathes at closure, matching emotional rhythm. Voice is singular and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Marissa with clean focalization. Perceptual signature shows through her curatorial lens ("every donated object carried a voice"). Dialogue advances plot and feels natural with subtext in Mrs. Chen's waiting and Thomas's "I hear things." Register is consistent and voice-motivated. However, peak moments lean on declarative interiority ("She'd created this space believing that listening heals") rather than embodied pressure, and the collective voice at the end ("we've always protected each other") reads more earnest than distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric-technical register ("lyrical code breaker," "mathematical music," "syntax" as gesture). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("methodically, each thread placed with purpose") that feels writerly rather than Elara's immediate perception under pressure. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature is present (codes as poetry, dance as syntax) but remains at one remove from embodied urgency. The prose maintains voice consistency but does not modulate rhythm with escalating stakes—there is no escalation to track.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and specific: Maris notices lamp oil, mooring posts, lantern routes, the weight of objects—all filtered through her occupation. POV distance remains stable; narrative certainty matches her knowledge. Diction stays controlled and purposeful: "gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals," "recursive and purposeful," "the spaces where removed things went." The prose rhythm modulates effectively, slowing for the descent, tightening at the cut. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The summoner's perceptual signature is distinctive: she thinks in craft metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") and perceives the world through ritualist filters (mapping silence, reading pauses between ripples). Psychic distance is close and consistent. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—meditative in preparation, slightly tighter during the brook ritual, then easing back at closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The invented terms are taught through context and remain voice-coherent rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable psychic distance with Elena as focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent ("transparent excuse," "peculiar quality," "mysterious familiarity") with selective elevation that fits the occult-academic register. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Mrs. Kovac's "You're late" and "That was the agreed upon lie between us" advance plot through indirection. The perceptual signature—Elena noticing Latin inscriptions, reading them without translating, touching the seal's weight—remains character-specific. Minor filter-verb density ("had come to recognize," "had felt") in expository passages doesn't flatten peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during shell-listening, slightly wider during garden survey). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices resonance structures, emotional residue, fragmentation—vocabulary fits a researcher who has turned her knowledge into private ritual. Diction stays within her register (quarantined memory, cognitive contagion, resonance poisoning) without unmotivated elevation. Minor slip: "the sky shifted from purple to deep blue" and "tragically radiant" recur as stock descriptors rather than evolving percepts under pressure. Reflection is substantial (~35% of text) but anchored to present stimuli (shell, flowers, dawn) and drives the final choice, meeting the BRR exception; no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Mei notices calligraphic precision ("each stroke a prayer"), tactile details (brush trembling, ink mixed with resolve), and the sanctuary's temporal markers. Dialogue carries subtext effectively—"But you won't" and the Magistrate's "Such confidence in a traitor" pursue goals obliquely. Some elevated diction ("calibrated treason," "pearl twilight") risks register mismatch for a desperate forger under immediate threat, though it coheres as a lyric narrative voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight interiority during the brush stroke, wider lens for the Magistrate's backstory revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("richly perceptive," "webs of intrigue"). Perceptual signature is present but passive—Mara notices and interprets rather than misreads under stress. The sister's voice in the shell is clearly framed. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("progressive disclosure," "reed-blown melancholy") but remains coherent. No dialogue on the page to test distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout, and Maya's perceptual signature—wreck-diver attuned to "the drowned," analyst of dreams—colors every observation. Katherine's voice arrives distinctly ("as knowing, settling into Maya's mind like snow"), and the dialogue exchange carries purposeful subtext (Katherine's need to be known, Maya's careful truth-weaving). However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "borrowed starlight given shape," "pure, cold knowledge," "the familiar ache of such meetings" read as thematic summary rather than Maya's interior idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but a few lines ("obligately," "cameo appearances") introduce vocabulary that jars against the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Kenji's perceptual signature (he sees patterns, arcs, conversations across time). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the girl's shame and Kenji's Socratic redirection carry subtext. Minor issue: Kenji's speech occasionally edges toward aphorism ("Every knot you tie...is part of a conversation across generations") that, while in character, risks sounding like the story explaining itself. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates well from reflection to demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, professional, and controlled: "Vera dealt in neither" (curses/miracles), "Beautiful nonsense," "uncomfortable truth." The focalization remains tightly Vera's; no head-hopping, and psychic distance is stable. Minor weakness: sentence rhythm becomes somewhat uniform in the middle investigation beats—many declarative subject-verb constructions in sequence. Diction fits the character (scientific, skeptical) but occasionally drifts toward generic narration ("sharp observant eye") rather than showing how her observation differs from others'. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance; perceptual signature is coherent (Elara notices signal patterns, storm fractals, light through glass). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in both her transmission and the prophet's riddles. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "hope and terror warring in her chest" and "shock of recognition" lean toward label-speak when embodied detail would sharpen. The prophet's voice carries subtext and advances plot, but Elara's diction remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature clear in "ink-stained fingers" and the poet's lens on "storm clouds" tarnish. Diction is largely controlled—"feral loft," "drift-treasures," "lonesome splendor"—creating a distinct texture. Brief dialogue from Mrs. Chen and Cosima carries goal and subtext without filter clutter. Minor issues: "positively wistful verses" and "gleaned redemption" edge toward authorial vocabulary rather than pure character idiom; "heart jingled with something richer" uses metaphor that feels slightly external to the established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with Meris as focalizer; no head-hopping. The engineer's perceptual filter is evident in technical observations ("vibrational signature," "resonance chamber," "acoustic baffles"), and her vocabulary remains consistent. However, certain phrases—"fleshly ethereal knowing," "the boundaries between guilt and innocence"—drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific under peak stress. Crane's dialogue delivers necessary exposition but lacks strong subtext or evasion. The prose modulates appropriately between technical precision and sensory immediacy, though some formulations ("azure coat," "amber light") read more decorative than functionally filtered through an engineer's crisis perception.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance with strong perceptual signature: Ren notices theodolite angles, atmospheric light-bending, magnetic interference—all filtered through her mapper's expertise. Diction is elevated but consistent ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful") and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains steady even under cold and fatigue. The phrase "patient revolution" recurs but as her private coinage, not authorial intrusion. Compression is purposeful: forty years of family observations condensed into "leather journal" without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with appropriate psychic distance. Elena's perceptual signature (empirical observation, methodical cataloging) is consistent and character-specific. The dialogue with Reeves is economical and carries subtext ("I need your preliminary findings. Now" signals threat). Minor weaknesses: "fortified vulnerability" appears as a somewhat generic descriptor, and phrases like "the ones that slipped through bureaucratic cracks" lean slightly expository. Diction remains largely within Elena's professional register, though "reverberate in your skull" in Malcolm's note is vivid and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited anchored to Eliana maintains clean psychic distance with no head-hopping; Marcus's interiority ("He'd carried those words like stones") is brief and remains in his段落 without leaking. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though occasional elevated phrasing ("aptly deliberate gaze," "ambient music seemed to swell") drifts slightly above the workbench-level texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in Marcus's "We both were" and Eliana's "Why bring it to me now?" The perceptual signature is strongest in Eliana's technical observations (loupe, verdigris, valve stems) and weakens slightly in the storm-cloud metaphor, which reads more authorial than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV is stable, psychic distance consistent, and Mal's perceptual signature—engineer's lexicon, scavenger's focus—shapes diction ("steadily curious," "transliterate," "kaleidoscope"). Rhythm modulates effectively (short bursts during the final adjustment, longer reflection in the mentor's memory). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose as character test passes: syntax reflects Mal's technical, wondering mind without filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Elena's perceptual signature—"noticing what others missed: the pause before a lie, the way light shifted when truth bent"—is established early and drives her investigation. Diction stays within her professional register (corporate memory keeper, cascading backups, redundant mirrors) while allowing lyric elevation at key beats. Minor weakness: the phrase "sensed absence" and "something vast and patient" in the climax lean slightly abstract for her concrete, data-focused lens, though they serve the ending's tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and evocative ("shadow-laced," "weighted breath," "starlight"), and narrative distance modulates appropriately—zooming into Maren's hands shaking, pulling back for the mirror montage. Perceptual signature is present: Maren notices "emotional architecture" and "hinge points," reflecting her peacekeeper lens. The phrase "calmly intuitive" appears as a label in the mirror sequence ("Maren moved between mirrors, calmly intuitive") rather than being shown through a micro-choice under pressure, a brief filter-verb slip that dulls immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices frequencies, translucence, dissolution. The prose modulates purposefully—"fold in patience" and "windborne and clean" carry lyric compression that fits her altered state. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven; Dr. Henriksen's lines serve pressure without explaining theme. Minor register drift: "the particular gentleness she'd grown to recognize in people who worked at the intersection of compassion and death" reads slightly clinical for her voice, though it's brief and the surrounding texture recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable throughout with Marcus's perceptual signature (vineyard sentinel, parallels-drawer). His "gently persuasive quality" inflects his speech without intrusion. Elena's dialogue carries distinct restraint ("You're not suggesting—") that contrasts his urgent explanation. Deduction for the therapy-inflected phrase "intersubjective understanding—seeing through multiple truths at once" in peak dialogue, which breaks naturalism. The prose modulates well with emotional pressure until the final summarizing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Senna; perceptual signature filters setting through her line-walker training ("not listening to their words but to the spaces between"). Diction stays consistent with a formal, measured register appropriate to ritual and observation. The old man's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Can you preserve what she made?"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor: the prophet's description "voice like wind through reeds" and "whisperfield calm" trend slightly toward stock lyricism, though they remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from exterior action (descent) to interior awareness (peripheral sensing) to spoken ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Margot is stable, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-explanatory register ("perceptively calm attention," "earnest whimsy," "subtle puzzle archivist") that fits the narrative's gentle didacticism, though it flirts with abstraction when pressure would benefit from concrete immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("I don't know what comes after," "Same time next week?"), carrying subtext of tentative hope without strain. However, diction occasionally drifts into therapeutic workshop language ("transmute pain into a masterpiece," "collective act of completing these arcs became a kind of permission") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated under stress; Margot observes "the particular shade of their grief" without her own contradictions emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer in reflection, wider in scene movement). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with scholarly register matching Elara's interiority ("sonically reflective," "climate-controlled vaults"). Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices acoustic patterns, vibrations, architectural singing. One friction: the phrase "weathered innocence in their fractured speech was actually wisdom, the knowing that comes before knowing" edges toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds her established idiom under peak pressure, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the prophet notices fog "like magnetic tape unspooling," processes time in reverse-prophetic terms, and filters sensation through his peculiar curse. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated ("susurrus," "nested," "crystalline moment") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming close during the chalk-writing beat, pulling back for the final reflection). One micro-slip: "This was the tidal longing that had driven him here" edges toward helpful-narrator explanation rather than letting the image carry the weight, though it recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kenji; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (repair-trained sensory attention, clockwork metaphors, attunement to tremor and spin). Diction is controlled and elevated but voice-appropriate for a contemplative technician. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Chen's lines advance plot without subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear frequently but fit the reflective register. Free indirect style is clean. The prose texture supports the meditative tone without losing clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maya with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she recognizes "the particular quality of light that preceded death" and filters sensory detail (antiseptic vs. "something green and beginning") through her professional lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("decisively kind," "hymning"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Maya's lines pursue goals (redirect Mr. Chen's approach) and carry subtext. One brief filter-verb cluster ("saw her pause…saw Rebecca take") in the reconciliation paragraph slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the beat. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct scholarly register ("budding rune scholar," "painstakingly deciphering"). Narrative distance is consistent, and perceptual signature reflects Mira's analytical lens (tracking "absence where shadows should have pooled," tracing "connections between entries"). However, some constructions flatten immediacy with filter verbs ("she sensed," "she believed") and the prose occasionally lifts into expository register ("The ancient texts spoke of sealed awakenings") that distances the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marianne's medical-rational filter: "her skeptic's training held," "catalogued every reason," "examining fingers." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at pressure points. Iris's dialogue carries distinct otherworldly diction ("eyes held too many seasons," "the cleft," "both worlds") that contrasts with Marianne's grounded precision. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—short declaratives at the tooth recognition, longer reflective periods during Iris's explanation. Minor filter-verb presence ("wanted to yearn") doesn't dull immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Maren's perceptual signature favors light behavior and tactile detail (striations in glass, leather wheel texture). Free indirect style is clean. Two mild register drifts: "as memories resurface, the mind becomes its own kind of tide" and "something between aquarium and planetarium" lean slightly elevated compared to the tactile workbench voice. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Psychic distance stays close except the meta-commentary line about memory as tide. "Serpentine cathedral" and "gallery of gentled light" feel slightly writerly but remain voice-plausible for an astronomer-turned-artisan. Under pressure (memory of Elena's death), compression is brief and returns quickly to present-tense polishing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Maya with clear perceptual filtering ("honeyed hush," "flutter in her chest"). Dialogue between Maya and Dr. Chen is functional and advances plot, though the register occasionally elevates ("I made it to stop being a watchful dreamer and become someone who acts"). Dr. Chen's exposition about the notebook is necessary but reads as information delivery rather than naturalistic speech under pressure. The piece maintains consistent narrative distance and tense. Voice is competent but lacks a sharp perceptual signature that would distinguish Maya's way of noticing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent and apt for the reflective mode. Diction is elevated and lyric—"swirling hush," "ephemeral cameo appearances"—and reads as purposeful rather than forced, though some phrases ("solemnize what was lost") approach writerly abstraction. Perceptual signature is clear: the novelist notices broken chambers, interrupted growth, shapes of hope as navigational rather than destination. The prose modulates appropriately from the catalogue of mist-figures to the quieter closing anchor. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong sensory filtering (velvet hush, wet earth). Distance control is consistent, though the narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal hour," "primal") that sits uneasily with the hands-on tinkerer focus. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The grandmother's "cramped hand" and Cassian's green-stained fingers provide concrete perceptual anchors, but syntactic patterns grow repetitive in the machine-operation sequence ("The sound that emerged," "The harvest moon," "The air smelled").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Vera's perceptions. Diction is elevated and consistent: "cambium still hoped," "cartography of hope," "moving stillness." Vocabulary fits an alchemist-astronomer sensibility without jarring register shifts. Perceptual signature is selective (she notices copper luminosity, electromagnetic whispers, photon histories) and voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance holds steady at a lyric-meditative middle range. Some filter verbs ("she could see it") dull immediacy slightly, and the prose occasionally tips toward explanatory interiority that restates on-page action rather than advancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV is clean with stable third-limited focalization. Marcus's perceptual signature—locksmith precision, attention to "secret anatomy" and "relationship between components"—remains consistent. The prose shifts register slightly under pressure: "temporal echoes" and "astronomical precision" feel elevated for someone working by torchlight with charcoal on leather. Brief dialogue ("To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later") carries subtext of isolation and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct lyric texture: "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped." Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads burdens as weights with angles, hears crystallization of sorrow—and diction remains elevated but character-particular (fractal weaver's professional idiom). Purposeful compression in the burden catalog (miner's exhaustion → amber, widow's loneliness → obsidian) accelerates accumulation without losing clarity. The grandmother's kerosene lamp passage shifts into brief backstory anchored by the present object, satisfying BRR. One minor slip: "boundary-lessly" reads as a neologism that slightly disrupts lexical cohesion, and the phrase "whalebone reverie" appears once without clear setup, though it does charge the oceanic filtering metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, wider during reflection). Perceptual signature is distinct: circus-trained attention to presence, practical beauty, and tool use. Diction remains within Margot's plausible lexicon with purposeful compression ("rust-hued peace," "hauntingly practical"). Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects the widow's mind under calm focus. Narrative certainty matches what she can know. Minor note: a few phrases trend slightly elevated ("crystallized time," "ambulatory through canvas") but remain voice-motivated and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature—collecting overheard phrases, chronological confusion, erosion metaphors—is distinct and consistent. Voice modulates appropriately from fragmented uncertainty to the resolute final beat. Two minor slips: the phrase "regret tasted like cloud-mist: substantial enough to choke on, insubstantial enough to question whether it existed at all" reads as writerly commentary rather than Mira's in-the-moment thought, and "negotiate with that specter of her former self" uses slightly elevated register. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming into the camera wheel, then out to the lagoon), and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with engineer-specific perceptual signature: "functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed," thermal scans, drainage blueprints. Psychic distance tightens during the drafting sequence, and diction remains within Lena's professional lexicon (conduits, hydroponic, calibrated markings). Minor slips: "melancholy romance" and "ghost rivers of purpose" edge toward elevated register during reflection, and the phrase "stoic around her" briefly externalizes the terminal's stance in a way that blurs filter use.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single close-third POV with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: "excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia." The prose modulates with emotional intensity—tighter syntax as she kneels, more expansive as she reflects on the sketchbook. Some filter verbs ("she understood," "she remembered") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The diction occasionally drifts toward elevated literary register ("accumulated resonance of every dream she'd buried") that feels slightly external to a scribe's interior lexicon under stress. No head-hopping, and the final paragraph sustains momentum without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct contemplative texture: "neither day nor night claiming dominion," "serene upheaval of understanding." Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits an educated, driven researcher. However, the voice occasionally drifts into exposition that abstracts rather than dramatizes—"The architecture of lies he'd left behind wasn't about false buildings or imaginary cities. It was about misdirection itself" reads more like essay than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans toward philosophical summary rather than sensory-specific bias shaped by urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is controlled and carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("oceanic hush…world holding its breath"). Diction remains consistent within Mira's scholarly yet sensory register. Interiority is clean with no head-hopping. The narrative modulates well between action (knot work) and reflection (secret weavers lore), though peak beats occasionally drift toward elevated abstraction ("infinite patience with time's own knots"). Psychic distance is stable; perceptual signature is evident but leans contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV through Maren is stable and well-controlled; her professional lens (obituaries, anchors, intimacy rituals) filters all perception. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from the opening's lyric remove to close interiority in the chamber. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the Duchess's "I project my presence there" and Maren's "what if you stopped explaining?" carry subtext and advance plot. The prose texture is distinct ("geographical exile," "erosion of years") with vocabulary apt to Maren's sensibility. One micro-slip: "lonesome splendor" as a descriptor of the Duchess's face reads slightly elevated for the otherwise grounded voice, though it remains within Maren's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent with elevated diction appropriate to Cael's scholarly background, though register occasionally drifts into essay-like abstraction ("hypothesizing about everything," "consciousness emerging from complexity"). Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom—Vashira and Cael sound interchangeable in their philosophical exchanges. Psychic distance remains stable. Filter verbs ("felt the palace's quaking reverie") are voice-motivated but cluster in reflective passages, mildly dulling immediacy during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in tight third over Maya; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("kelp-drift peace," "reverse stars") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext in Elena's whispered question and Maya's reply. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction inconsistent with Maya's firefighter pragmatism: "grafted onto my soul," "kelp-drift peace," "unyielding compassion" read more authorial than character-particular. Under peak emotional pressure (Elena's tears, the final moment), the voice maintains its lyric cadence without modulating toward urgency, which flattens the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture through rhythm and image selection ("consciousness caught like insects in amber," "sidereal patience"). Diction remains elevated and consistent, though occasionally it drifts toward abstraction ("realistically imaginative mind mapped possibilities") that feels more like narrator assist than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generalized; Mira's noticing is more atmospheric than selectively biased by profession or wound.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in tight third on the Keeper with occasional dips into the mother's perception ("unnerved the mother"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the Keeper notices via sonar, sees "through" things, and perceives in cosmic timescales ("three thousand generations"). The mother's speech ("What are you?") and the daughter's silent curiosity provide modest voice distinction. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (close on the Keeper's memory, distant on the species' repetition). Minor filter-verb reliance ("they were something otherworldly") slightly dulls immediacy in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filter verbs ("felt," "understood") serve voice without dulling immediacy. The carver's perceptual signature (noticing limestone's detail-holding, tracing inscribed letters, seeing monuments as waypoints) is character-specific. Dialogue between carver and Marcus feels natural and advances plot ("You're carrying more than mine"), though both voices share elevated diction that risks convergence. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The final line's register ("We are the carvers of each other's remembering") reads slightly elevated for the POV but fits the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, intimate distance throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: mechanical precision, guilt-weighted observation, tactile focus (smooth wood, brass resistance). Diction remains controlled—elevated but character-apt ("calcified finger," "searing reverie"). The "searing reverie of creation" line risks slight register drift but recovers through embodied action (wrists ache, vision blurs). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately during carving. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short declaratives at the pendulum release, lyric drift in the final paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering detail through Marta's professional and personal lens (marigolds, headstones, chess tactics). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices border patterns, grave markings, and symbolic sequences. Diction stays character-bound with occasional elevated touches ("velveteen gloom," "frayed threads of ink") that feel voice-motivated rather than intrusive. Minor slip: "understanding's cold light" in the penultimate paragraph briefly veers toward abstract summary, though it recovers quickly with the concrete plan. No dialogue appears; interiority and narrative distance remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping. Maren's perceptual signature—focused on patterns, gaps, frameworks—is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("innovation didn't flourish in unlimited freedom but within precise constraints") that feels expository rather than lived. The prose has texture, but peak moments lack the rhythmic intensification that would elevate urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout, with Elena's professional lens (copyist, notation) filtering perception. Diction stays consistent with her character—"measure of Brahms," "manuscript pages," "one careful notation at a time"—without register drift. However, peak moments rely on filter verbs and summary: "She understood her true purpose now" and "Elena believed those particles retained memory" tell rather than dramatize realization. The phrase "thistled calm" appears as narrator description rather than Elena's idiom. Perceptual signature is present but not distinct enough to feel indelible; the voice reads competent but not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance shifts intentionally (close during mask handling, wider during reflection). Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("charcoal portrait ash scatterer," "mirage of safety," "components of faith"). No head-hopping. However, the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated register ("terrible, marvelous instant of recognition," "dispersing the components of faith itself") that, while apt for the contemplative mode, slightly exceeds Elena's established idiom under peak pressure. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature (ash patterns, incomplete paintings) is selective and character-specific. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and pays it off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is distinct: "sedimentary layers," "abrasive calm," "rational rebellion" feel character-particular. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("not force truth on the unwilling, but preserve it"). Karin's speech reflects academic idiom without caricature. Minor slip: "agonizing over her words, weighing each one" is slightly filter-heavy for a peak beat, though it serves to show her care. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mrs. Chen with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a slightly elevated literary register ("traveled stillness," "braid diverse voices") that occasionally drifts from the focalizer's immediate perception into thematic commentary. The gathered students speak no dialogue, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Filter verbs ("she had seen it happen before") appear but do not dull the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering through Mara's chef-trained perception ("tasting memories," "rust-flaked soil"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate interiority to wider social consequence. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("synaptic plasticity," "consciousness could be shared without being lost") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. The girl's dialogue is brief but functional. Diction under peak pressure (the first bite) stays grounded, though "gently reorganizing her understanding through synaptic plasticity" reads clinical rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; her involuntary candor filters perception consistently ("She couldn't have lied even if she'd wanted to"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Chen's confession carries subtext (relief, shame) and Mira's blunt questions advance plot. The prose has distinct texture: "nectar and gold," "elaborate death," "waste itself on beauty" carry a lyric precision that fits the conceptual stakes. Minor diction quibble: "credible endurance/renunciation" in the final planning beat reads slightly elevated for Mira's toll-keeper baseline, though her educated interiority supports it. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices hedges creeping, pharmacy transformations, light caught "dreaming." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("shard of hush," "archaeology of feeling"). The psychic distance narrows smoothly at the climax ("the house exhaling"). However, "inadvertently profound in her ritual, though she would have laughed at such a description" momentarily breaks focalization with authorial commentary, undercutting the otherwise clean POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with tight focalization through Marina's perceptions (oxygen gauge, trembling hand, "new eyes"). Psychic distance is controlled; the statue's telepathy is clearly cued and italicized, distinct from Marina's internal voice. Diction is elevated but consistent with an educated diver processing philosophical weight ("cascading revelations," "incisively kind," "structural weaknesses in her certainty"). Minor: phrases like "incisively kind" and "thread understanding through time" occasionally feel slightly abstracted for peak pressure, though they remain voice-plausible. The statue's italicized consciousness carries distinct syntax and warmth; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (mathematical metaphors, "symphony of variables") is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext in Castellano's line about the chipped die. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "balancedly daring" in the narration reads slightly algorithmic—a descriptor that feels imported from the prompt rather than organic to Mara's thought idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, and the final lines ("waited for the world to move") carry rhythmic charge. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (moon-pressed coin, toxic amber, methodically hopeful). Diction stays within Mara's register. However, several lines carry elevated poetic abstraction ("insomnia required a system, a ritual to convert exhaustion into something useful," "Moonlight was a library without walls") that, while voice-motivated, sometimes drift toward essay-like distillation rather than immediate sensory thought under pressure. No head-hopping or filter stacks; the piece maintains coherent focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Celeste; psychic distance is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads the world through museum-curator and displaced-person lenses ("artifacts of interrupted lives," "cultures survived through deliberate preservation"). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent, with occasional elevated register ("perpetually displaced," "testimonies of the exiled") that fits her profession. Dialogue is minimal but functional: "I brought you something" and "Look" carry subtext (invitation, instruction, hope). The phrase "rosewater dread that had perfumed the grotto city for months" is narrator summary rather than Celeste's present perception, a brief psychic distance slip. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; Maren's perceptual signature (reverse-engineering mindset, attention to mechanisms, defiant philosophy) is distinct. Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful compression ("the tide exhaled its slow retreat," "latent radiance"). However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("creating something that existed in dialogue with reversed time") that reads more like authorial summary than Maren's lived thought under pressure. The final paragraph's philosophical gloss ("beyond fate's design, in the bleak exhilaration of pure possibility") edges toward告summary rather than embodied sensation, though the overall voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries gothic texture through phrases like "smile was a wound opening" and "silk dragging across gravel." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unbosom herself," "paradoxical notes") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The photographic curse creates a distinct perceptual signature (capturing "every shadow, every angle") but this seeing-mechanism doesn't consistently shape narrative perception throughout. No dialogue issues; the advisor's speech fits his mysterious role.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Maren notices cloud fractals, resonance patterns, and backwards currents through her prophet's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "sketched resonance," "dubbing," "restless euphony" create a consistent idiom. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Deren's brief exchange advances plot and establishes professional trust. The brief reflection on her drowned home anchors present purpose without derailing momentum. Psychic distance remains consistent. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Diction is character-particular ("patient geometry," "shadow-water," "crack their certainty") and maintains a slightly elevated register appropriate to a scholar-cartographer. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices spirals, measurements, patterns. One minor register slip: "the city had accepted its imprisonment with disturbing ease" reads slightly authorial rather than Maren's lived idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during whistle-blowing, wider during expository reflection on the expedition). No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and Elena's perceptual filter is consistent. Dialogue in the Hawthorne exchange carries subtext and advances the goal, though both voices share a similar formal register under stress. The prose modulates appropriately between description and conversation. However, peak moments default to tell-mode—"her historian's training," "emotionally rational"—rather than letting syntax and rhythm embody pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Marcus throughout; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. The prose carries distinct texture: "archaeologist of abandoned dreams," "patient, inexorable absence," "hushed blaze quality." However, two issues limit the score: First, "stoically sensitive" and "hushed blaze" function as authorial labels rather than emerging from the character's perceptual signature. Second, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-specific: "interlaced absence: present and gone simultaneously" reads as conceptual overlay rather than Marcus's natural idiom under pressure. The voice is accomplished but not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and character-appropriate for an indexer: "meticulous system," "pre-electric methodology," "archaeology of meaning." Perceptual signature shows professional filter (noticing publisher insignias, paper stock, authentication sheets). However, certain phrases feel authorial rather than Mira-specific: "tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "swimming shadows." The phrase "electricity of a different sort" in a key moment reads as writerly metaphor rather than the character's natural idiom. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can know; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mei notices craft details (mirror arrangements, fold types) and her interior voice is poetic but character-particular ("craftier than priests"). The reflection on Lin's question about glass and sky anchors present action. Minor filter-verb density ("felt like," "watched until") slightly dulls immediacy in a few beats, but voice remains consistent under pressure and the final tight sequence (transform, polish, fold, release) locks rhythm to her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Mira's perceptual signature: she notices circuit breakers, auroras as wedding veils, probability clouds. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("bleak exhilaration scientists get," "intangibly tangible weight"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven; Vahedi's "ghost hunt?" and Mira's reply advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to atmospheric observation. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats, and the prose reflects her analytical yet grief-driven mind.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (sharp-eyed, wonder-reactive) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; the pilgrim's lines carry subtext of selection and destiny. Minor filter-verb density ("Mara realized," "something in her chest already knew") in the chip-reveal beat slightly dulls immediacy. Diction remains within POV lexicon; no register drift. The perpetually surprised expression is mentioned twice but not enacted through perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's perceptual bias ("driftwood accumulated like broken promises"). Elias's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the confrontation without expository clutter. Some diction edges toward elevated register ("tempered regret," "crystallized into something sharper") but remains voice-consistent. Filter verbs ("she'd found," "she'd built") are acceptable and purposeful. Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Psychic modulation supports emotional beats cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV is stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. Katrin's perceptual signature emphasizes texture (brass worn smooth, centuries etched into stone) and professional calm. The phrase "furrowed hush" as a voice description is evocative but slightly strained. Dialogue feels functional and goal-driven: the Northern commander's "What if they run?" and Katrin's patient responses advance the standoff without excess. Minor filter-verb reliance ("feeling centuries," "She withdrew") but not pervasive. No head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately between exposition and the ritual's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in Marina's focalization with clean psychic distance. Perceptual signature is navigator-specific: she reads weather, counts poles, calculates launch windows. The voice modulates appropriately under pressure—compressed syntax during the refusal beat, expanding into lyric rhythm at the ending. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Amy's "I didn't get it. Or maybe I did and deleted it" carries subtext and advances plot efficiently. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The phrase "flickering faith in a universe that made sense" risks slight over-articulation but reads as Marina's professional assessment rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Voice carries some texture ("jaded wonder," "delicately robust") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("permutation of human nature," "kindle empathy") that reads slightly above Marcus's immediate crisis perception. The Interpreter's dialogue feels purposeful and distinct. Filter verbs ("feeling the stitches," "stared at") appear but don't badly dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific; Marcus's way of noticing could belong to many seekers.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice remains consistent—lyric, elevated, fairy-tale register—with purposeful diction ("cosmic intimacy," "hollow echo of distant stars"). Mira's perceptual signature (beast whisperer noticing fractured animal languages, spice-scent layering) is character-specific. Dialogue between Mira and Tam advances the stakes and carries subtext (his warning, her defiant question). Occasional filter verbs ("felt her edges begin to blur") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Mira throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and confident, with tight focalization on the cartomancer's perceptions. Diction is character-specific ("cloudbound repentance," "onyx-ink cards," "willingly perplexed") and rhythmic control is strong—short, breathless sentences at the climax ("She gasped"), longer cadences during reflection. The phrase "willingly perplexed" reads as slightly elevated for the moment but remains within plausible lexicon for a mystical practitioner. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices symbolic objects (cards, cloth, crack) through a cartomancer's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mei's perceptual signature—reading salt-crystal patterns, noticing light refraction—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Akio's lines advancing the thematic tension. The prose modulates appropriately (lightness when content, grounded when challenged). However, Mei's diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bodhisattva," "spectroscopic equipment," "fractal pattern") that reads more authorial than character-specific under peak stress, and Akio's voice lacks strong differentiation from Mei's narrative idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (reflective, philosophical, attuned to patterns). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("vibrant hush," "granular," "texture"). However, some phrases drift into elevated register that feels slightly authorial rather than character-rooted ("ancient dance," "fullness of quiet"). The surveyor's brief dialogue feels natural. Psychic distance remains consistent. Free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates appropriately with the release of the bugs intensifying the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Maren's perceptions (trailing fingers, reading Voss's shadow shifts). Voice carries purposeful diction ("conspirator's cloak," "winking hush") and the dialogue distinguishes Maren's calm replies from Voss's knowing tone. Minor deduction: free indirect thought occasionally over-explains on-page action ("Each key she copied…had been calculated") and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the ending beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Korin's perceptual signature: "a vial of matter so dense it bent light around her fingers, so ancient it remembered when the universe knew how to hold things together." Diction is elevated but consistent ("premonition," "otherworldly," "bioluminescence"), and the prose modulates with pressure—shorter clauses as she places the final stones. No dialogue; no head-hopping. The voice is slightly ornamental (frequent lyricism in high-pressure beats), but it reads as deliberate texture rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-close on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (storm as moral landscape, cartography metaphors, poetic compression). Diction is elevated but remains anchored to Mara's role as poet: "rarefy," "conspiracy of whispers," "longitude and latitude from loss." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter under the storm's illumination, wider during reflective passages. Some elevated phrasing ("storm-kissed wonder," "naked machinery of power") flirts with over-writing but stays voice-motivated. No dialogue present; internal voice is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Adelaine's POV is stable, her diction mixing academic precision with embodied detail (mechanical arm whirring, "diplomatically fierce" voice). Dialogue carries goal pursuit and subtext—Harwick's "You're stalling" versus Adelaine's calm deflection. Minor slip: "dignified chaos" appears as authorial label in the final paragraph, breaking immersion. The perceptual signature (angles, brass, measurements) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close filter through Mara's September self; perceptual signature is character-specific ("angular in thought," "sharp edges"). Voice modulates purposefully: "smiling felt borrowed from whoever she'd been in August" versus the impromptu poetry's loose doggerel. Dialogue carries subtext (Kai's "That's terrible poetry" / "I know" exchange conveys affection and shared history). Psychic distance tightens during the planting sequence. One minor slip: "forge beauty from anarchy" reads slightly elevated for the vagrant poet's established idiom, though it could be September's precision. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature (pianist's texture: memorized cracks, wistful playing, ritual winding). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("tidal arbor," "steely longing," "temporal displacement"). The husband's single line of dialogue—"I heard music... Between the frames. I followed it home"—carries appropriate register and subtext. Minor slip: "strategically creative" in the motivation paragraph feels slightly elevated for the established voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance tightens during Kima's reflection on dreams. Kima's perceptual signature (reality checker's skepticism layered with aching belief) is consistent. Dialogue between Kima and Prem carries distinct voices—Prem's pragmatism versus Kima's reflective complexity. Minor slip: the phrase "luminous doubt of pre-dawn hours" reads as elevated diction that hovers near the edge of the established register. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters detail through Mira's grief-tinged lens. Takeo's dialogue ("each word arriving like a wave lapping against stone") sustains his slow-spoken attribute with purposeful rhythm. The prose modulates well between action and reflection, and dialogue advances understanding without exposition dumps. Minor slips: "rhythmically placid" applied to both setting and Takeo's voice feels like authorial echo rather than Mira's perception, and the final paragraph's diction ("holding space for all the words") leans slightly abstract for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice feels coherently anchored in a scientist who thinks in precise images and analogies (“a teaspoon would weigh a billion tons,” “microscopic mirrors”). Diction is consistent with Helena’s education and temperament, and the narrative distance remains stable, easing between external action and reflective interiority without leakage.

Narrative distance is stable and free-indirect moments blend smoothly with description. Dialogue is functional and mostly natural, though Galloway’s rhetoric (“The territorial government bleeds us dry”) can sound like expository position-taking more than embodied speech. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct enough to feel like a singular mind rather than generic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well matched to Mara’s sensibility—sensory focus shifts from sound to touch and visual pattern in a way that feels psychologically apt. Diction and syntax are controlled and modulate with the emotional stakes, sustaining a quiet, elegiac tone without slipping into purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “navigating by the compass of his exhaustion” and “the building maintained its own atmosphere through sheer stubborn refusal.” Third-person focus mostly stays close to Marcel while allowing brief, controlled omniscient dips to sketch the scholars’ history. Rhythm and diction suit the eerie, contemplative tone without tipping into purple excess. There is little dialogue, but the single spoken line is clean and in-character.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in exile and practical care. Syntax and diction are controlled and modulate appropriately between reflective passages and the live scene at the arbor.

There are no POV slips or register jolts that undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice stays closely aligned with Mei while allowing brief, controlled zoom-outs (“The locals said…”) that feel organic. Diction and rhythm are consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and the perceptual signature—attention to light, inversion, and subtle bodily states—feels specific to this character and context. Dialogue is spare but functional, carrying stakes and instruction rather than exposition. The “foggy lucidity” modulation during the breathing and vision sequence is convincingly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct blend of botanical, mathematical, and contemplative diction that feels true to this character. Focalization stays tight to Lyra’s perceptions; the few clinical or mythic registers (“retrocognitively trapped,” “saint’s crown”) are motivated by world context rather than stray authorial intrusion. Rhythm is generally well-controlled, with longer, flowing sentences matching the reverie mode while remaining legible. At times the explanatory register about hyperbolic geometry edges toward essayistic, which slightly flattens the emotional intimacy, but it doesn’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with diction that matches Mira’s focused, quietly intense perspective. Phrasing like “the staggering grace of seeds splitting concrete” gives the narrative a distinct, slightly elevated texture without breaking plausibility for the character.

Psychic distance is well modulated: we move seamlessly between external description and interior realization without head-hopping or abrupt stance shifts. The narrative confidence—especially in handling the speculative sensory logic—never slips into over-explanation or muddy abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that fits the slightly fabulist world. Phrases like “moonlight pooled thick as honey” and “destiny’s door” feel of a piece with Maya’s sensibility rather than imposed. Dialogue is clear and functional, though often used to deliver explained lore rather than subtext-rich sparring, which slightly flattens texture. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong if not radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical glassblowing diction with Marcus’s gently theatrical narration. His habit of addressing an imagined audience creates a strong perceptual signature and underpins the “weighty lightness” tone.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (“relief marbled with doubt,” “map made entirely of absences”).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person on J-7 is stable and coherent, with a measured, slightly formal diction that suits a reflective machine consciousness. Expository lines from Dr. Yemeni are mostly natural, though they occasionally tilt toward info-dump rather than embodied speech.

POV control remains clean throughout, with no leakage or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited POV on Mira is stable and well controlled, with a consistent, slightly lyrical narrative distance that suits her observant nature. Voice and diction feel unified; the prose’s sensibility—interested in light, sound, and pattern—matches Mira’s attentional habits.

There is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond a mild, acceptable compression in articulating Dmitri’s motives.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person through Marcus is steady and controlled; his perceptions are colored by his preoccupation with luck without breaking plausibility. The vine dresser’s voice in dialogue is distinct—measured, precise, and grounded—contrasting well with his more anxious, abstract framing. Lyric touches (“like light through leaves,” “certainty of roots finding water”) feel character-filtered and not generically ornate. POV contains no leaks or awkward elisions; the narrative distance modulates smoothly between observation and quiet interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third POV on Kael is stable and controlled, with a confident, slightly elevated SF register that fits the setting. The prose has a distinct texture (“language spoken in metal and intention”) and Venn’s voice is plausibly distinct in her mix of detachment and wonder. There’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; vantage and knowledge stay with Kael. While strong and consistent, the voice is more polished than singularly idiosyncratic, stopping short of truly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without being opaque, and clearly inflected by Marta’s musician’s perception (e.g., acoustics of water, “hush of unstruck chords”). Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer descriptive sentences opening into shorter, weightier beats at emotional turns. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the slight omniscient touches (brief backstory on Constance, Moretti) feel integrated into the narrative texture rather than intrusive exposition. Voice remains controlled even at the end, where the orchestration of light and music could easily have tipped into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature in its blend of technical focus and lyric perception (“auroral sorrow,” “occupying the margins where truth lives”). POV is controlled and stays inside Mira’s frame of knowledge without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady and atmospheric, with a good ear for rhythm and a distinct blend of skepticism and haunted curiosity (“drowsy alertness,” “phantom workers”). The integration of the radio show into his perception works smoothly, though at times the narration edges into a more generalized, essayistic register that partially dilutes Marcus’s specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close/limited voice is consistent, controlled, and possesses a distinct lyric texture that matches the subject. Diction (“regenerative silence,” “history composted itself”) is elevated but coherent with a quasi-mythic, timeless register; it feels like the mind of someone who has lived among chronicles for “untold seasons.” Rhythm varies well between longer sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones, especially toward the end. A slight risk is that the reflective register is almost uniformly lofty, leaving little modulation in voice under different emotional pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, warm, and precise, with a perceptual signature grounded in sound and subtle shifts in affect that feel particular to Mara. Diction and rhythm largely match her age, experience, and profession; lyric touches (“where ordinary magic breathed”) are controlled and legible. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Thomas’s lines feeling age-appropriate yet luminous, and Mara’s responses modulated to avoid overwhelming him. Psychic distance tightens gracefully around key beats (the hum, the first words, the box reopening) without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and slightly lyrical, with a distinct texture in phrases like “bronze quiet” and “after the last human dream had been dreamt.” Diction and rhythm feel appropriate to a contemplative, archivist protagonist and the quiet stakes.

The modulation from observational calm to a slightly heightened urgency around the tapestry is subtle but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, assured, and colored by Maya’s professional lexicon of light, codes, and “directing flow.” Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with a quiet lyricism that suits the espionage-in-miniature premise. Explanatory lines about the system still feel like part of her worldview rather than neutral exposition. The voice doesn’t take extreme formal risks, but it’s distinctive and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“origami made of light,” “muffled clarity”) that suits the metaphysical setting. Third-person focus sticks cleanly with Calloway’s operational and theological lens, even when briefly summarizing the entity’s nature. Rhythm and diction modulate well, becoming softer and more spacious as the ritual culminates in stillness. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in thematic lines is the only real drag on an otherwise confident voice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and noticeably textured, with a lyrical yet controlled register that fits Mira’s reflective, slightly melancholy cast of mind. Diction (e.g., “chronological homesickness,” “visual symphony frozen in calcium carbonate”) aligns with someone steeped in both language and metaphor. Psychic distance is handled well, moving smoothly between immediate perception and reflective memory without confusion or head-hopping. The modulation under emotional pressure is subtle but present, maintaining clarity while allowing heightened phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in metaphors like “procedurally generated landscape” and “brightening darkness.” The speculative terminology feels integrated with her worldview and doesn’t break psychic distance. Temporal shifts are smoothly handled via clear triggers (tablet activating, runes aligning), so POV and stance remain stable despite nonlinearity. There’s a faint hint of authorial register in phrases like “cosmic algorithm” and “periodically eternal,” but they fit the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to a story about sound and silence, with controlled metaphors and a calm, meditative cadence. POV stays essentially fixed on Oskar, with minor, plausible access to others’ reported reactions; there’s no disorienting head-hopping. Dialogue and signing are sparse but effective, particularly Marie’s “I can’t feel anything when I play anymore” and “It’s like the silence is singing,” which carry subtext and move the story. The voice might risk slight sameness of register across beats, but overall control and texture are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct perceptual signature: attention to barometric shifts, patterns, and infrastructure is consistent and character-rooted. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a slightly elevated but believable register for a thoughtful scientist, and psychic distance remains stable. Dialogue is mostly natural and goal-driven, though the older woman’s lines tip toward exposition and occasionally sound like they’re carrying authorial theme. Even so, the overall POV control and modulation of voice under pressure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and lyrically controlled, with a strong perceptual signature around light, absence, and crystalline imagery. Diction and rhythm are elevated but appropriate to the speculative-literary register and Maren’s reflective state. Expository lines (e.g., explaining the plague’s effect on olfaction) are compact and don’t break the voice. There is no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue from Kovač feels suitably restrained and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, comfortably inhabiting a lyrical, metaphor-attuned mind without feeling generic or over-written. Marcus’s perceptual signature—treating friction burns as sentences, time as layered texture—is consistent and character-driven. Sarah’s brief dialogue is a bit didactic but still plausibly shaped by her altered state and purpose. POV remains stable and legible throughout, with no leakage or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, sensorially rich, and clearly anchored in Maya’s acoustic bias, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and lyrical without tipping into abstraction, and the narrative distance stays consistent. The few lines of dialogue are spare and natural, matching the learned, heavy silence of the group; the piece relies more on narrated perception and does so effectively. Psychic distance tightens nicely around key beats (the hush’s retreat, the bowl’s contents, the final sound) without any head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, close, and colored by Mara’s professional sensibility, with recurring phrases like “professionally thorough” reinforcing character and tone. Diction is precise and lyrical without drifting into registers that feel alien to the POV. The narrative distance remains consistent; we are never told what non-POV characters feel beyond what Mara can infer. Rhythm varies well, with lush descriptive sentences balanced by cleaner, declarative ones at decision points.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mildly lyrical texture that suits the reflective mood, and viewpoint control is clean. Diction like “cautious exuberance” and “currency of gratitude” fits Marianne’s educated professional sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature in the way Kael notices texture, light, and sound. Diction and syntax are consistent and modulate effectively between description and moments of emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, helping to externalize stakes and invite Kael into interaction without over-explaining. There are no POV slips or unmotivated stance shifts, and the narrative distance remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Vera’s observational, almost scientific sensibility. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and the narrative doesn’t slip out of her knowledge range or into unmotivated abstraction. The prose modulates nicely between descriptive stillness (the stretched “now”) and more urgent movement as time snaps back, all without POV leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, precise, and distinctively colored by Elara’s mathematical and conjuring lens, with metaphors (“love…by the shape of its absence”) feeling character-rooted rather than generic. Rhythm and syntax are well controlled, modulating between lush description and slightly tighter phrasing as the ritual intensifies. There are no POV slips or register lurches, and the lyric texture remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person narration has a clear, consistent texture: calmly lyrical, with precise word choice and controlled rhythm that fits Miriam’s “kindly methodical” nature. POV boundaries are respected; we never leave her consciousness except through observable behavior of others. The voice modulates gently with emotional beats (the tape-smell flashback, the student’s reaction) without sliding into a different register. It’s distinctive and assured, though not formally daring enough to push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, restrained, and suited to a former researcher whose perception is both precise and increasingly intuitive. Diction and syntax are controlled without sliding into jargon, and the narrative distance stays stable, never leaking information Maya would not have. Rhythmic variation between longer reflective sentences and tighter present-moment observations keeps the piece from feeling monotonous. There’s room for a slightly more idiosyncratic verbal fingerprint to make the voice unmistakable, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and coherent, with a perceptual signature shaped by her being a painter (patterns, light, texture) and a survivor (fatigue, vigilance). Dialogue between her and Marcus is natural, concise, and purpose-driven, advancing both world logic and thematic tension without feeling expository. The diction and rhythm maintain a consistent, slightly lyric register that suits the reflective mode but rarely overreaches into purple. It stops short of truly distinctive idiolect or high-risk stylistic play, which keeps it just below the top tier for a venue seeking maximal voice singularity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, lyrical texture—“frequencies Mara could taste—copper and starlight”—that matches the metaphysical premise and stays consistent throughout. Mara’s perceptual signature (sound-as-prophecy, shadows as markers) gives the narration personality and differentiates it from the emissary’s more neutral speech. Psychic distance is well-controlled, sliding inward for epiphany without head-hopping or explanatory hand-holding. Dialogue is slightly expository in the emissary’s monologue, but it remains clear and in-character enough not to break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and nicely textured, with a perceptual signature rooted in cataloguing, fragments, and intervals. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between lyric description and more direct dialogue; nothing feels over-explained. Dialogue is lean and natural, advancing both relationship and theme (“I thought everything would be gone” / “Nothing’s gone”). The voice is strong and controlled enough to be memorable, though not so idiosyncratic as to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: Mara reads the world in routes, angles, and symbolic constellations. Diction is elevated but coherent with a reflective, aesthetically inclined protagonist, and the occasional lyric flourish (“contract written in starlight”) fits her psyche. Dialogue between Mara and the conductor is lean, natural, and subtext-rich, advancing both stakes and theme. POV boundaries are respected; there is no leakage into omniscient summary or other characters’ interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-calibrated to Elena’s scientific and reflective temperament, with a smooth blend of concrete observation and abstract thought. Diction and syntax are controlled and readable, without head-hopping or register shocks. The narrative distance tightens appropriately during the tile activation, heightening immediacy. While the voice is strong, it doesn’t yet have an unmistakably idiosyncratic rhythm or lexical fingerprint that would push it into the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent with an ancient, hyper-aware focalizer; Naia’s dialogue carries a distinct weary defiance. Diction like “dimensionally aware—a curse in itself” and “mutiny occurring within the fabric itself” feels motivated by Cassius’s long familiarity with cosmic phenomena. The modulation from cool observation to roughened emotion at the climax is handled smoothly. There’s mild risk of the narration occasionally sounding more like an omniscient stylist than Cassius himself, but not enough to break POV or undercut the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with measured, image-rich narration that feels plausibly filtered through Mara’s analytical yet empathetic mind. Dialogue is clean, purposeful, and carries subtext about power and self-deception—Vincent’s “Hope is hope” attempts to reframe exploitation as kindness. Lexicon and rhythm are controlled, with a nice modulation between cool description and sharper emotional beats. A few lines veer toward slightly writerly abstraction, but they stay within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct—precise, observant, mildly academic, and suffused with quiet wonder—which fits an “earnestly studious” stationer perfectly. Lexicon and syntax stay consistent and controlled, with a good balance of lyricism and clarity. At times the prose edges toward an essayistic register, but that tilt feels aligned with this character’s way of perceiving and cataloguing the world rather than generic authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward patterns, absences, and repurposed objects that feels particular to Maya. Diction is lyrical but controlled, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately around key discoveries without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse yet natural, carrying subtext—especially in the harbormaster’s understated admission about his mother’s death and roses. The voice maintains coherence while delivering reflective passages, avoiding expository “helpful narrator” tendencies.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Mira’s scientific yet grieving sensibility. Lyric touches (“some instruments aren’t meant to be finished by their makers,” “some instruments…measure distances that have no units”) feel earned and character-appropriate given the liminal, reflective mood. Dialogue fragments between Mira and her grandmother carry layered history without over-explaining, and the narrative distance holds steady. There’s occasional drift into near-authorial articulation of theme, but not enough to fracture POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “perpetual carnival that bobbed and swayed” and “culture shock absorber.” Diction generally suits Marina’s perspective—sensory, concrete, observant—with only occasional abstraction. Rhythm is varied and controlled, allowing for both lush description and tighter, forward-moving sentences. The brief dialogue at the end is clean and in-character, though it’s minimal and mostly functional rather than heavily subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits a reflective scientist at a solemn moment. POV boundaries are clean; we remain in Chen’s perception and inference without omniscient leakage. Rhythm varies well between descriptive, expository, and climactic beats, supporting both mood and clarity. Some phrases have a workshop-polished feel, but they generally read as intentional lyricism rather than generic template.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice around Mara is controlled, with consistent sensory emphasis on sound, touch, and temperature that suits her blindness and trade. Prose rhythm is varied and confident, and dialogue is natural, if occasionally expository. There are a few generic or editorial-feeling intrusions (“She was a heartfelt artisan,” “heartfelt precision”), but they don’t break POV. Overall, the voice is distinct and steady even under the mild time pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, observant tone that matches Mira’s cartographic mindset. Diction is precise but not overwrought, and the prose occasionally reaches for a lyrical cadence without losing clarity. Dialogue between Mira and Petrov sounds natural, encodes status and history, and advances exposition and stakes without feeling like a dump. While the voice is strong and apt, it stops just short of feeling unmistakably idiosyncratic or formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person narration has a controlled, lyrical voice with consistent diction and cadence well-suited to the fable-like concept. Phrasing around sound, rhythm, and silence gives the prose a distinct perceptual signature without slipping registers. Dialogue is sparse but functions as action, revealing character and reinforcing theme rather than dumping information. POV stance is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscient intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice on Mara is stable and unobtrusive, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits the material. Dialogue is clean, functional, and distinct enough—Chen’s awe and regret versus Mara’s clipped pragmatism—though neither voice feels particularly idiosyncratic. The narration maintains consistent psychic distance, dipping into Mara’s perceptions without head-hopping. Overall, the voice is polished and controlled but not yet distinctive enough to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is steady, slightly lyrical, and well-matched to the eerie, contemplative material. Diction is controlled and mostly character-appropriate; it leans elevated without straying into academic register. Dialogue is natural and purposeful, carrying exposition and subtext without feeling expository-heavy. There’s a distinct tonal signature, even if Matthias’s internal language could be individualized a bit further.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical register that suits the gothic-fantastical material, and the prose rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and key turns. Dialogue feels natural for the heightened mode and carries clear subtext: Eleanora’s mix of hope and grief, Marcus’ fear tipping into acceptance. POV control is solid, with no head-hopping and a steady distance. A few lines veer toward overt exposition of lore rather than allowing implication, but overall the voice feels confident and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“orchid solace,” “grammar of possibility”) that feels organic rather than mannered. POV distance is well-controlled; the narration moves smoothly between the weaver’s perspective and a slightly elevated, fable-like stance without confusion. Lexicon and rhythm suit the quasi-mythic tone and remain steady through time jumps. The lack of dialogue is an intentional, fitting choice for this meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, fluent, and well-matched to the material: gently lyrical, observant, and reverent without becoming ornate. The narrative distance is consistent, never leaking into information Miriam couldn’t plausibly frame this way, and reflective passages are anchored in concrete present cues (roots, stones, letters). It’s more polished than distinctive, lacking the truly idiosyncratic cadences that would lift it into the exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated but believable for a reflective, detail-oriented professional like Iris. Diction and rhythm support the contemplative, nostalgic mood without tipping into self-consciousness, and the narrative only shares what Iris can plausibly infer or remember. Interior access is clean and focused on the present decision, with backstory woven rather than dumped. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she reads codes and infrastructure that helps the voice feel particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, restrained, and well suited to a patient, observant protagonist who “listens” more than she speaks. Diction (“adjacent possibilities,” “echoed silence”) feels character-appropriate for a lifelong observer in a scientific-religious institution, and the prose modulates smoothly from contemplative to urgent as the coup nears. Dialogue is brief but carries status dynamics—Vas’s contempt vs. Mirelle’s feigned madness—without feeling expository. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register jumps, though a slightly more idiosyncratic rhythm in Mirelle’s interiority could make the voice even more singular.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice centered on Meera is controlled and consistent, with a measured, lyrical tone that fits the material. Diction and rhythm (“roots twisted like arthritic fingers,” “spirits sang their endless, wordless songs”) establish a distinct texture without slipping registers. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-directed, revealing desperation, boundary-setting, and guidance without over-explaining. Occasional generalizing lines about “people who lived in that liminal space” stay within the chosen lyrical stance and don’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Maricel’s—attuned to language games, metaphor, and ethical nuance. Diction like “lotus-hearted knowledge” and the coral-labyrinth conceit fits her educated, reflective sensibility and the slightly hallucinatory state induced by anesthetic. The distance control under pressure is good: we feel her slipping into haze while still tracking the logic of the decode. A few elevated turns of phrase flirt with preciousness but never fully tip into mannered or implausibly omniscient.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly aligned with an observant muralist; diction (“phosphorescent pigments,” “negative space,” “columns” of light) feels rooted in her sensibility. Rhythm varies well, with descriptive stretches tightened by purposeful verbs and concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and clearly filtered through Lena’s sensibility, with nicely calibrated lyricism (“methodically playful,” “the pause between question and reply”).

Rhythm and diction feel intentional rather than generic, with no head-hopping or register drift. It reads as a distinct, publishable voice, even if not quite singular enough to be unmistakable at a glance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, with a distinct, slightly wry intellectual texture that suits a “charming rogue scholar” focal center. Diction like “candidly cryptic,” “warp their location,” and “garden of the mind” feels controlled and consistent rather than showy.

There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the voice sustains tension and a sense of covert ritual effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)

The voice is strong and memorable enough to carry a largely interior piece without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctly Miren’s, with imagery choices (prisms, orchids as frozen music) reflecting her sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled, varying between precise, almost ritualistic sentences and more expansive, reflective ones as emotion deepens. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts; even the more abstract lines feel anchored in her lived context. The voice sustains an elegiac tone without lapsing into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice around Mira is consistent, confident, and colored by her academic/linguistic sensibility (“orthography,” “syntax,” “interconnected promises”) without feeling like dry exposition. Sentence rhythms vary well, balancing lyric description with clear action, and psychic distance tightens naturally at emotional beats. Dialogue is spare but effective, carrying subtext (his guardedness, her vulnerability) without over-explaining. There are no POV slips or register jolts; the narrative texture feels unified and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, marrying technical precision (“microscopic fibers,” “mineral deposits”) with lyrical perception (“exhaled,” “encrypted compassion”). Diction feels plausibly Mira’s for a highly educated, reflective machinist, and the perceptual signature—seeing ethics through engineering—remains distinct. Rhythm varies nicely, though a few sentences tip toward overtly crafted aphorism. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady and distinct, with a gently lyrical texture that feels appropriate to Clara’s sensibility and history. Diction and rhythm are controlled without drifting into abstraction or academic register. The narrative never head-hops, and its observational bias (air currents, dust like galaxies, the tactile feel of objects) is consistent with who Clara is. There are no glaring mechanical issues, and the modulation from description to reflection to small choices is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent: lyrical yet precise, with recurring technical lexicon (weather codes, surveyor’s precision) that feels organic to Mara’s worldview. Psychic distance stays close without head-hopping, and the third-person focalization is stable. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Thomas’s “fractured hush” and gentle probing serving as a tonal and thematic counterpoint rather than exposition. Rhythms modulate well between dense lyric description and cleaner, shorter lines at key turns (e.g., the PRESNT notation moment).

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and plausibly aligned with a scientifically trained yet lyrically inclined mind, blending technical diction (“gravitational waves,” “pressurized warren”) with more poetic turns. Senna’s perceptions guide the narrative texture, and Mara’s dialogue reads as natural and distinct enough within the short space. Rhythm and sentence variety are controlled, with cadences that stretch in reflective moments and tighten around discoveries. A few coined phrases (“shadowseam wonder”) flirt with self-consciousness but remain consistent with the established tonal register.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature—Marina’s language and metaphors are shaped by sea, stone, and memory-work. Authorial omniscience about cosmology (“reality itself was constantly pruning…”) fits the fable-like, concept-driven mode and doesn’t feel like a POV breach given the story’s mythic register. Rhythm varies well, and the invented term “cheerful gloom” feels like part of her world rather than an outside label.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and subtly colored by Mara’s analytical perception (mapping variables, probability fields) without sliding into sterile exposition. Sentence rhythm varies well between lush descriptive passages and brisker action/dialogue, and the idiom fits the contemporary, slightly literary tone. Dialogue is lean, natural, and carries subtext—Rebecca’s “You’re good at reading people, terrible at protecting yourself” both critiques and tempts Mara. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the voice feels singular and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture (“obsidian grace,” “write permanence into motion”) that matches Kaleth’s sensibility and the story’s cosmic ambitions.

A confident, unified narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a controlled lyrical texture (“his face a topography of burn scars that caught the silver light like mountain shadows”). Marcus’s perceptual biases—watching celestial movements, translating pain into something carryable—shape the diction in a character-appropriate way. Rhythm varies well, with longer reflective lines balanced by decisive, grounded statements. A few abstract formulations brush the edge of authorial essaying but do not break the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well matched to a character who blends math and wonder; diction choices like “logical dreamer” and “serene upheaval” feel coherent with her mind. The narrative distance is controlled, with smooth interleaving of perception, memory, and current action. There’s no head-hopping despite the multi-timeline conceit because all versions of Mira are treated as facets of one focal lens by the end. A slight tendency to explain thematic insight directly keeps the voice just shy of exceptional subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well calibrated, with narration colored by Maya’s acoustic and spatial preoccupations. Diction and imagery (acoustic signatures, ghost-pressure, buildings “participating” in history) create a distinct, mildly lyric voice without drifting into abstraction. There is no head-hopping; access to knowledge stays plausibly bounded by her perceptions. Rhythm modulates effectively between atmospheric description and key turns like the moment she recognizes herself on the negative.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that hovers close to Vesper while occasionally widening for conceptual commentary. Diction and rhythm suit the liminal, magical realism–adjacent mode without drifting into academic or over-wrought register. The “dusky harmony” of the heartbeat and the lullaby’s phrasing exemplify a distinctive perceptual signature. There is no dialogue to test modulation between voices, but the narrative stance itself feels singular and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, confident, and consistent, with a distinct professional-lyric texture that suits Maren’s long experience and moral weariness. Phrases like “operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated to disarm without diminishing” exemplify a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare but natural, revealing status shifts (the general’s protest; Maren’s steel-edged interruption) without heavy exposition. The voice occasionally edges into abstract commentary, but it remains grounded enough that distance control never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, with a distinct blend of corporate ruthlessness and buried lyricism that feels particular to Marcus. Lines like “ethics were simply market inefficiencies” and “dense as grief” both sound like this specific man’s mind at different depths of psychic distance. The narrative stance stays stable, with reflection always anchored to present stimuli (egg weight, crack pattern, thunder), and there is no head-hopping or register whiplash. Rhythm modulates appropriately, tightening around the drop of the egg and loosening into a more reverent cadence as the rain arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical, with an elevated but controlled register that suits the mythic, courtly-fantasy frame. Phrasing like “between sigh and smile” and “palace that devoured desire” establishes a distinct texture and perceptual habit rooted in Celestine’s aestheticized life. Psychic distance stays stable; we never slip into information she could not plausibly infer. At times the diction leans toward familiar lyric-fantasy idioms, but it remains coherent and does not disrupt POV.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, with a refined, slightly formal diction that fits an “urbane calligrapher” turned conceptual puppeteer. Sentences vary in rhythm, and the narrative distance is consistent, dipping closer for key realizations without head-hopping. The perceptual signature—attentive to objects, craft, and metaphor (radar, meteor hush, carved stick)—feels particular to this mind. Occasionally the expository explanation of ethics flattens the otherwise textured voice, but not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a rejected academic-artist; terms like “esoteric realist” and “Architectures of Impermanent Meaning” feel character-specific. Sentence rhythm is well modulated between long, meditative lines and tighter, focused moments at key beats (the first monarch’s arrival, the final touch of the moth wing). There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the mild theoretical register matches the character rather than reading as generic exposition. A touch more idiosyncratic quirk or surprising diction under peak emotion could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinct, with good control of rhythm and image, especially around the craft details and the aurora. Diction and cadence feel unified—elevated but plausible for this quasi-mythic frame—and the narrative distance stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly tuned to this character’s sensibility, with temporal oddities and metaphors that feel native to her. Rhythm and diction show good control, balancing lyricism with concrete detail (e.g., mycelial networks, wafer seals, radioactive soil). Psychic distance is managed cleanly; we never lose track of the focalizer or slip into unjustified omniscience. The voice might risk uniformity of register (every moment is equally elevated), but it remains coherent and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct contemplative-scientific texture (“empirically ironic truth,” “schematic representations”) that suits the protagonist. The prose modulates appropriately from patient description in the palace to more charged, compressed moments in the desert climax. At times the register slips into slightly abstract or expository phrasing, but it doesn’t undercut the voice’s coherence. Overall, the narrative stance feels unified and credible without head-hopping or strained flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, clean, and consistent, with a clear speculative-literary register that suits the material. POV control is solid: we move through an external narrative lens that can inhabit Kale’s experience without confusing head-hopping, and the reality shifts are articulated without losing track of who is perceiving. Diction and rhythm have a quiet, ritual quality that modulates well around key beats like the music box’s activation. There’s little in the way of sharply idiosyncratic verbal texture, but the prose feels assured and not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Aria’s sensibility, with imagery (frost, glass, fog) reflecting both her craft and her emotional state. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure—the breathing sequence, for example, tightens cadence to match the ritual. Brief bits of dialogue feel natural within the heightened, fable-like register and carry subtext about lost origins and disorientation. There are no POV slips or register breaks; the style is distinctive without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice through Marta is steady, with her perceptions and regrets shaping diction and focus. Dialogue feels natural and distinct—Lena’s clipped, pointed lines contrast Marta’s more explanatory ones, and exchanges advance conflict rather than recap it. Rhythm and syntax are varied and mostly well-matched to emotional beats, with lyric passages (apple blossoms, saints, quartz) balanced by more straightforward craft description. A slight tendency toward aphoristic phrasing at the end is the only notable softness.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending professional precision with lyric strangeness in a way that feels specific to a seasoned curator confronting the impossible. Diction choices like “organized chaos into meaning” and “fear itself had learned to phosphoresce” show a distinct perceptual signature without slipping into incoherence. Temporal handling of reflection is clean, and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. A touch more compression in a couple of explanatory sentences would tighten the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and well-matched to an arcane linguist—abstract concepts and technical phrases feel in-character rather than authorial. Diction and rhythm are consistently elevated but not purple, and the sparse dialogue is natural and thematically loaded (“The symphony of what never was”). Psychic distance is stable; we stay anchored in Marin’s intellect and perception. A slightly stronger differentiation between narrative register and spoken language could sharpen texture further, but it’s already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, consistent lyricism well-matched to Mira’s fragmented perception and the speculative premise. Diction and imagery feel unified and purposeful, with Soren’s brief spoken lines distinct enough and functional as internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a contemplative, competent archivist—measured, observant, with just enough warmth. Diction and syntax are consistent, with a mild lyricism (“sound like pages turning, like doors opening in sequence”) that suits the premise without becoming purple. Psychic distance is controlled, slipping naturally between external detail and interior reasoning. There’s little risk here, but what it attempts is executed with polished control.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a textured but controlled lexicon that fits this contemplative, quasi-mythic SF-fantasy world. Phrasing like “sound that lived in the bones” and “hammered repose” feels distinctive rather than generic, and the narration stays inside Kael’s perceptual logic. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the elevated diction feels voice-appropriate rather than imposed. A higher score would require an even more idiosyncratic, unmistakably personal rhythm under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Esme’s sensibility; her way of naming things (“constellation” vs. “coincidence,” “glass-song”) feels character-specific. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentences modulating between lush description and clearer exposition without jarring register shifts. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyricism generally serves atmosphere instead of obscuring sense. A few phrases flirt with being writerly for their own sake, but they don’t destabilize POV.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a meditative speculative piece, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elden notices time, weather, and trace emotions in the crystals. Diction and syntax maintain a high-literary register without obvious register drift or POV breakage. The brief interior question (“Is it conjecture… or prophecy?”) feels in-character and advances both plot and theme. At times the narrator edges into slightly essayistic explanation, but this stays largely within the bounds of Elden’s informed perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by Kael’s relationship to light and timing, giving the prose a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is economical and natural, with the woman’s slightly playful gravity distinct from Kael’s cautiousness. The narrative maintains a stable distance and doesn’t over-explain, trusting image and action. A few abstract formulations around the group’s philosophy are slightly more expository in register but don’t break voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is closely aligned with Chen, with a calm, observant lexicon that fits his scientific and emotional temperament. His inner framing of events (reading Mira’s silences, tracking centimeters of tide) gives the narration a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural, with small shifts (her initial sharpness, the emerging humor) carrying subtext without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close-third voice is steady and controlled, with a mildly lyrical, observant texture that fits Marco’s patient, ritualized practice. Dialogue is natural enough, carrying clear goals (comforting, reframing) and some subtext, though it occasionally drifts toward essayistic explanation. POV remains stable without head-hopping, and psychic distance is well managed. A slight excess of polished, aphoristic lines flattens voice specificity at climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)

    The third-person voice has a distinctive lyrical texture—“a confession in ash and charcoal,” “temple of beautiful devastation”—that remains consistent without collapsing into opacity. POV is steady and controlled, hovering close enough to Mara’s sensibility to feel filtered through her but not slipping into omniscient commentary.

POV control is steady; we never slip out of her knowledge or stance, and the narrative modulates smoothly between concrete perception and more conceptual reflection. The only limitation is that the voice sometimes tells us thematic takeaways a touch too directly instead of trusting the imagery.

Exposition largely maintains character filter rather than slipping into generic omniscience, and the narrative distance stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with an elevated but coherent diction that suits a reflective, musically oriented protagonist. The prose has a distinct rhythmic and imagistic texture (e.g., “as though the earth itself had learned mathematics from dreaming”) that feels intentional rather than generic. Psychic distance remains under control, with no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts, and interior access is smoothly woven into description. The lyricism is consistent enough to read as a perceptual signature rather than authorial drift.

Under pressure, the voice tightens without losing its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and convincingly colored by Sera’s mathematical and sensory obsessions—technical terms like “cambium” and “harmonic ratios” feel voice-true.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice stays anchored in Marina while allowing lightly omniscient-seeming flourishes (“after reality became negotiable”) that suit the fable-like tone without causing leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is assured, with controlled lyricism (“words that seemed to taste of honey and ash,” “velvet disquiet”) and stable close-third/limited-omniscient distance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third on Marcus is stable and coherent, with his theatrical narration giving the piece a distinct sonic texture.

    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with an ex-hydrologist: technical diction (flow rate, coordinates) sits naturally alongside metaphor. The perceptual signature—seeing everything through water, systems, and sediment—is distinctive and sustained. Occasional abstractions (“vertigo of unmedicated consciousness”) skirt essayistic, but they still feel like this character’s mind at work rather than authorial intrusion. POV remains clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the lyrical, speculative mode, with a clear perceptual signature (attention to pattern, delay, and unspoken interiorities). Diction and rhythm mostly feel controlled and confident, avoiding exposition-heavy scaffolding and maintaining emotional throughline without head-hopping. Occasional explanatory sentences about meaning and purpose flatten the otherwise strong texture but don’t derail the voice. The modulation from cautious wonder to solemn recognition reads smooth and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that feels consistent with a reflective, slightly estranged expert surrounded by sentient plants. Diction is elevated but coherent, and the integration of telepathic plant commentary into the narrative flow is smooth. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, with lush descriptive sentences balanced by shorter, purposeful lines in decision moments. At times the lyricism flirts with over-richness, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, aligning well with Lyra’s meditative, ritualistic perspective. Diction (“threshold of stillness,” “lucidly watchful care”) fits the elevated tone and the quasi-mystical vocation without obvious register slips. There is a distinct perceptual signature in how she notices temperature, light, and the aurora’s “patterns,” though the voice is more classically literary than idiosyncratically hers. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified claims of knowledge beyond Lyra’s interpretive frame.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice through Keiko is stable and lyrical without losing clarity; her perceptions (“vineyard hush,” “blade wrapped in silk”) feel character-specific. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and reads as slightly elevated but appropriate for a numinous setting. The woman’s speech is distinct in its calm, aphoristic cadence versus Keiko’s more searching admissions. There’s minor risk of the voices converging in philosophical register near the end, but not enough to blur POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct, with a measured, slightly lyrical cadence that suits a reflective crisis. Mara’s perceptions and diction feel coherent with her role and mindset, and the keeper’s speech has a subtly different texture that marks him as a separate presence. Exposition is mostly embedded in action or concrete memory, and the psychic distance remains stable. There are no POV slips or register jolts.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with distinctive phrasings like “sycamore hush” and “living backward through wisdom” that feel integrated rather than ornamental. POV distance is steady; we remain close enough to sense the teacher’s perspective while the narration maintains a slightly mythic remove. Dialogue is formal but suits the meditative tone and carries subtext about fear, readiness, and loss. There are no head-hops or stance slips, and the voice modulates gently as the trance deepens and the ending saddens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-suited to mythic-fantasy material, with controlled lyricism ("sound itself had become a physical thing, layered like sediment in stone"). Kael’s perceptual signature—seeing the world in harmonics, pulses, and patterns—is distinct and consistent. The narrative confidently relays his specialized understanding without POV slippage or explanatory fussiness. It doesn’t quite reach an exceptional edge because the rhythm, while smooth, stays in a fairly uniform contemplative register without sharp modulation under the story’s mild pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lucid, and distinctively contemplative, with controlled lyricism (“brilliant dimness,” “accommodates impossibilities”). Diction and rhythm match a thoughtful, slightly self-doubting mage reflecting under pressure. There are a few sentences that sound more like authorial essay than Maren’s lived perception (especially around the automation critique), but they don’t break POV coherence. Overall, the narrative texture is confident and well modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, closely aligned with Mara’s perceptions, and maintains a confident, lyrical register that fits the subject matter. Diction and imagery (“meteor hush ascent,” “infinite dark score”) are distinctive without becoming unreadably ornate, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain. Psychic distance is managed well: we move smoothly between outer action (lighting, diving, photographing) and interior color-sound associations. The voice is memorable and coherent, if occasionally a touch decorous relative to the fairly low on-page stress.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with clear focalization through Mira and only light, controlled omniscient framing of the cosmic situation. Diction is elevated but consistent with the speculative, almost religious mood, and doesn’t drift into jarring registers. Dialogue between Mira and Kael feels natural enough and serves to externalize conflict and exposition without sounding purely didactic. The voice lacks some idiosyncratic sharpness that would push it into truly distinctive territory, but it is assured and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, measured lyricism that fits Mira’s age, burden, and role, and it holds steady without head-hopping. Phrasing like “a jewel of perfect grief” and “careful, distant way” gives the prose a recognizable texture of restrained emotion and “distant intimacy.” Narrative distance modulates well, moving from atmospheric description to tighter emotional focus at key beats. Occasional abstract formulations feel a shade essayistic, but they don’t significantly disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and well-matched to an observant, slightly self-doubting mage; numerate details (drop counts, tide tables) feel like his way of seeing. Narrative distance remains stable with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The prose modulates gently with pressure—more lyric at dawn and closure, more expository during explanation—without losing coherence. It’s strong and polished, if not so idiosyncratic that it becomes unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person POV on Marcus is stable and coherent, with Eleanor’s speech and diction distinct and age-appropriate. The narrative voice has a mild lyricism (“the peculiar hour when darkness and light existed simultaneously”) that stays largely within what feels plausible for a reflective, middle-aged warden. Dialogue is clean, purposeful, and carries subtext—especially Eleanor’s need for validation and Marcus’s gradual softening into memory. There are no jarring register shifts or head-hops, and psychic distance is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close POV is stable and well-controlled, with a distinct lyrical texture aligned to Lyra’s sensibility as a scientist-enchanter (“vials and instruments” alongside “first mornings and forgotten centuries”). Diction and rhythm are consistent, with purposeful modulation at key beats (the orchard’s song, the formula crystallizing). There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice carries the load with ease and without exposition-heavy intrusion. The piece reads as a confident, singular perspective rather than generic fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a calm, observant texture that suits Vera’s role and the story’s contemplative tone. Dialogue is lean and functional, carrying status dynamics (Ground vs Command vs Vera) without feeling expository. The prose doesn’t achieve a strikingly idiosyncratic or risky voice, but it’s controlled and modulates appropriately as pressure rises. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice on Kira is consistent, with a controlled speculative register and a clear perceptual signature (seeing timelines as neural branches, for instance). Dialogue is clean, plausible for the characters’ intellect and context, and carries subtext about guilt, love, and self-doubt. Occasionally the narration slips toward a general-philosophical essay tone that feels less tightly bound to Kira’s immediate sensory or emotional experience. Even so, POV remains controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited POV is stable, and the narrative lexicon matches an intelligent, pattern-focused adult comfortably. The voice has some texture—e.g., “orthogonal approaches,” “hush of a possibility just born”—that hints at Margot’s puzzle-designer mind without drifting into overt abstraction. It’s not a highly idiosyncratic or unforgettable voice, but it’s controlled and consistent. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance remains appropriate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical texture that fits Martin’s state without drifting into an alien register. Phrasing like “other conductors had batons; he had a leaf blower and grief” is both character-true and stylistically distinctive. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially Sarah’s soft “Show me” and “Tomorrow?” which carry a lot of weight. The voice modulation under pressure is strong, though a few abstracted lines in the finale slightly distance us from Martin’s immediate perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending lyric description with concrete sensory anchors in a way that feels appropriate to a centuries-old, semi-feral guardian. Phrases like “foggy lucidity” and “dimensional longing” push toward the abstract but remain legible and in keeping with the piece’s cerebral fantasy tone. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving between external action and interior thought without leakage or head-hopping. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony and supports the atmospheric build.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, with a distinct texture that suits a reflective, technically minded alchemist; metaphors tend to be sharp and character-colored. Psychic distance is stable, dipping closer at key beats (the ritual, her tears) without head-hopping or stance confusion. There’s some elevated diction, but it aligns with the quasi-archaic, mystical milieu and Cassia’s contemplative temperament. Dialogue is minimal but handled cleanly where present.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and convincing, blending technical lexicon (“interpretation array,” “frequencies”) with lyricism in a way that suits a specialist with a quasi-mystical job. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with evocative phrases like “iron prayers” and “blueprint of silence” standing out without feeling purple. At times the narrative slides toward essayistic exposition when articulating her realizations, but the perspective remains anchored in her mind and practice. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, clear, and well-controlled, with a few strong phrasings (“clocks ran sideways,” “water that reflected stars at impossible angles”) that give it texture. POV stays cleanly anchored in Mateo’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the slight narrative distance suits the fable-like speculative mode. Dialogue between Mateo and Torres is functional and natural enough, though it leans expository rather than subtextual. The voice is competent and distinctive enough for publication, but not yet at a remarkably idiosyncratic or risk-taking level.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated register that suits a highly conceptual, professional protagonist. Phrases like “rational enchantment” and “fever dream architect” provide a subtle but distinct texture. The narration occasionally drifts toward abstract thematic statement, but overall perception remains plausibly bounded by Marina’s lens. There are no POV slips or stance confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical without overreaching, and fits Carta’s reflective, technical sensibility. Alien speech and description have a distinct texture that contrasts yet harmonizes with her more human, nautical lexicon. Distance is well-managed; we stay inside her observational and emotional frame without head-hopping. A bit more idiosyncratic rhythm or diction tied specifically to her lifelong navigator’s mindset could further individualize the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice around Mira is confident, with controlled lyrical flourishes (“twilight poured through the glass ceiling like spilled ink,” “promising things with edges like broken glass”) that match the tone and do not overrun clarity. Technical jargon (“electromagnetic signatures of emotional resonance”) feels plausibly within her lexicon and is deployed sparingly enough to maintain atmosphere. Dialogue is natural, distinct between Mira’s calm assurance and Lily’s fragility, and it advances both plot and subtext. Psychic distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping or register drift, giving the narrative a coherent perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a steady, pressurized lyricism that fits Mara’s scientific yet haunted perspective. Technical terms (cables, sensors, phase transitions) integrate cleanly with more poetic phrases (“crashing hush,” “information ghosts”) without jarring register shifts. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narration doesn’t over-explain what’s already clear in scene. The voice is strong and competent, though it stops just short of having a truly idiosyncratic, unmistakable stylistic fingerprint.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistently tuned to Mira’s sensibility—scientific yet haunted—and the diction (“digital ghost,” “cathedral silence,” “opalescent dawn”) balances lyricism with clarity. Psychic distance is well controlled: the prose moves smoothly between physical detail and interior reflection without head-hopping or stance confusion. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctness, but the narrative voice has a clear, memorable texture. Under pressure, the rhythm tightens without becoming opaque or overblown.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically consistent, and clearly filtered through Sarielle’s sensibility as a toucher/reader of texture (“every surface held a story her fingers could read”). Diction and rhythm support the mythic, elegiac mood without slipping into academic abstraction or exposition. The narrative distance stays controlled; we never head-hop, and the camera knows only what Sarielle can infer. Occasional high-poetic lines skirt the edge of preciousness, but they remain in character for the elevated, fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent with a scientifically trained but emotionally wounded protagonist. Diction balances lyrical (“stories that twisted like smoke”) with clear reporting of anomalous phenomena, and psychic distance narrows effectively at key beats (lifting the phone, hearing Voss’s laugh). Dialogue is economical and carries subtext, particularly in Old Marrow’s lines, which push at her assumptions. There’s mild risk of the narrative voice drifting a bit more poetic than her likely internal register, but it largely feels cohesive rather than committee-like.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well controlled, with a distinct texture (e.g., “tasted of starlight,” “tarnished wonder of a world remembering how to change”). POV distance is consistent and apt; we stay close enough to Mira’s perceptions while allowing a lightly mythic register. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation from quiet observation to intensified cadence during the musical climax reads intentional. It’s a confident, unified narrative stance, if not yet radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and character-specific, with a muted, observant texture that matches Maren’s cautious, professional mindset. Phrasing like “brittle hush,” “warring silences,” and “nothing-spaces” gives the prose a distinct lexicon without drifting into self-conscious ornament. Expository lines about her track record (“seventeen families… twelve children… four couples”) compress backstory efficiently in a voice-consistent way. The main ceiling is that under peak-pressure beats the voice doesn’t noticeably tighten or fracture; it maintains a uniform contemplative register rather than modulating rhythm to heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a distinct sensory bias toward craft and sound.

Overall the voice feels crafted and specific rather than generic, even if it doesn’t take major risks.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly Cordelia’s—cerebral yet tender, comfortably deploying mathematical and literary diction. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to sustain lyricism without becoming mannered, and brief dialogue (“Do you feel that?”) feels natural and grounded. The “documentarian” stance toward the patrons is a strong POV choice that shapes observation and tone. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative distance tightens and relaxes with good control.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, consistently close to Mara, and supports the lyrical, slightly haunted tone. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate without sliding into mannered opacity, and the light/photography lexicon is well integrated. The distance modulates appropriately as the piece moves from backstory-laden reflection into the immediate cave scene. There is little dialogue, but the narrative voice is distinct enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV on Mara remains stable and controlled, with only light omniscient flavor in the locksmith’s description that doesn’t break coherence. Prose rhythm is varied, and the voice sustains a quiet, mythic register that fits the material without egregious register slips. Dialogue is functional and mostly natural for a fable-like piece, advancing plot and theme efficiently. The narrative voice is competent and occasionally striking, though not so idiosyncratic as to feel singular at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and coherent, with a clear perceptual signature: scientific yet sensuous, grounded in folklore and material culture. Rhythm and diction modulate well between lyric description and precise explanatory beats (astronomical records, shipwreck patterns). There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; even the more abstract meditations on memory feel anchored in Vera’s worldview. A few thematic sentences edge toward authorial rather than purely character-filtered thought, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and closely aligned with the archivist’s sensibility, with a distinct texture (“brokenness has architecture,” “afternoon shadow caught in glass”). Dialogue generally sounds natural and character-appropriate, capturing Finn’s oscillation between derision and need. At times, both characters speak in a similarly polished, reflective register that feels slightly adult for the boy. Still, distance and rhythm are well controlled, and the narrative stance remains confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a lyric-fantastical mode, with controlled syntax and consistent diction. The narration stays firmly within Mara’s perceptual frame while allowing a slightly elevated, mythic register that still feels earned by her age and vocation. Rhythms modulate nicely between lush description and more direct action lines, and there are no POV slips or explanatory “helper” intrusions. The main limitation is that the voice, while strong, doesn’t quite achieve a uniquely idiosyncratic texture that would distinguish it at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, gently lyrical, and consistent, with strong image choices like “his features shifting like water.” POV stays cleanly with Maren’s perspective, with justifiable access to the fisherman’s affect through observation and dialogue. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, advancing stakes and clarifying guilt rather than expositing mechanics. While the voice is polished and pleasant, its rhythm and diction are more “highly competent” than strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, confident, and well-matched to an analytical, observant protagonist. Diction and imagery (“frames of light,” “maps tear along fault lines”) give the prose a distinct, slightly lyrical texture without losing clarity. The narrative distance stays stable; we never leave Maren’s perceptual and conceptual frame. Occasional abstract lines feel a bit essayistic but mostly harmonize with her cartographic, reflective mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent—literate, slightly clinical, shaped by a scientist’s sensibility but suffused with quiet grief. Diction like “equilibrium,” “threads of cause and effect,” and “cathedral of loss” feels unified and character-appropriate. There’s no POV leakage or register whiplash, and shifts between observation and reflection are smooth. It stops short of having an unmistakably idiosyncratic rhythm or quirk that would push it into the 9-band, but it’s already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady and confident, with a consistent, slightly archaic-lyric diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) that suits the world. The narration stays within Moth’s perceptual frame without head-hopping, and the rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony. While the voice is pleasant and occasionally striking, it doesn’t reach a level of idiosyncrasy that feels wholly singular or indispensable. It’s strong, controlled work rather than unmistakable stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and character-coherent, with a measured, slightly lyrical diction that fits Maren’s reflective temperament. The prose modulates rhythm well with the elevator’s steady climb, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach what she could plausibly infer. There is some register lift into essayistic phrasing around the captain’s philosophy, but it doesn’t fully break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice is distinctive enough for this length and maintains control.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive blend of technical meteorological language and lyric perception that clearly belongs to this specific character. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both external observation and interior reflection without slippage or omniscient leakage. Rhythm and diction modulate with emotional intensity but remain within a coherent register.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinct—analytical yet sensuous, with a good balance between technical language and lyricism. The perceptual signature (faces as patterns, touch as vision, fractal precision) feels particular to this character. Narrative distance and tense are stable, with reflection anchored cleanly to present stimuli. There’s room to push rhythmic variation or idiosyncratic turns of phrase further, but the current execution is already strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice feels confidently controlled, with a perceptual signature rooted in Celeste’s cartographic and linguistic preoccupations.

With no dialogue to test, voice work rests entirely on narration, where it remains distinct and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to Miren’s craft-focused, contemplative gaze, with consistent diction and no POV slippage. Metaphors like books “crystallized into sculptures” and prophecies as “shed skin” feel organic to both character and world, giving the prose a distinct texture without tipping into opacity. Psychic distance is controlled, easing closer for key choices (gear selection) and slightly wider for thematic reflection. There’s little dialogue, but the narrative voice itself carries mood and intent with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, fluent, and unobtrusively lyrical, with phrases like “brambled hope” giving it some texture. POV focus on Mara is consistent, with brief but coherent zoom-outs to summarize colony-wide shifts; there’s no confusing head-hopping. Dialogue sounds natural enough and advances plot and theme without feeling expository except in the slightly didactic final exchange. The voice is solid and professional, if not stylistically distinctive enough to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“pane of hush,” “nested patterns,” “bruised awe”) that feels native to this character’s way of perceiving. Rhythm varies well between longer lyric sentences and shorter, grounding lines like “Three minutes. Closer to midnight.” The narrative stance remains tightly aligned with her knowledge and sensibility, with no head-hopping or register breaks. A slight tendency to reuse certain signature phrases borders on mannerism, but functions more as motif than as a true voice flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly lyrical register that fits the fantastical setting and Maren’s reflective stance. Diction and imagery (“bark rough as grief,” “sun bleeding orange”) give the narration texture without serious register breaks. Dialogue, though sparse, is functional and natural under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending a scientific lexicon with a musical, pattern-oriented sensibility that feels unique to Maya. Diction and rhythm are measured but not bloodless, and the prose modulates smoothly as she shifts from numb observation to a more fluid, humming engagement with the scene. There’s no POV leakage or unnecessary explanatory intrusions from an external narrator. A few abstract sentences could be slightly more grounded in her immediate sensory processing, but overall the voice is distinctive and well-tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct conceptual lexicon (quantifying absence, integrated fragmentation) that feels native to Vera’s mind. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, differentiating the customer’s blunt need from Vera’s more meditative register. Psychic distance stays steady, with brief, intentional expansions for world description that don’t break focalization. Rhythm and diction are well modulated, supporting the accumulative, contemplative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature: Maron understands the world in flavors, chemistry, and process. Diction balances accessible lyricism with clarity; sentences vary in rhythm without falling into template cadences, and the narrative stance does not overreach his knowledge. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, differentiating Amira’s pragmatic, keeper-like exposition from Maron’s more sensory, analytic speech. The voice could perhaps fracture a bit more under peak psychic strain to reflect stress, but control remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, slightly elevated, and musically inflected, fitting both character and subject. Diction is consistent and avoids jarring register shifts, and the narrative confidently compresses time while staying anchored in Mara’s perspective.

While strong and polished, the voice doesn’t quite reach the extreme distinctiveness or risk that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical scientific register that suits a neural engineer immersed in quasi-mystical phenomena.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Marlow’s sensibility—technical language about frequencies sits comfortably beside synesthetic color descriptors. The narrative stance remains stable, and psychic distance is well managed, tightening around key beats (the clasp trembling, the diary opening) without head-hopping or register jolts. A few aphoristic lines feel more like authorial commentary than Marlow’s unvarnished thought, but they don’t break the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly matched to an observant, craft-focused herbalist; diction like “wildflower hush” feels character-driven rather than generic. The narrative distance is stable, with smooth movement between sensory observation and reflection. Rhythms vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A slight tendency toward overtly aphoristic lines at thematic peaks is the only thing keeping this from the very highest band.

Occasional rhetorical flourishes land as characterful rather than generic omniscient commentary. The controlled blurring of time (“yesterday, or tomorrow”) is taught early and used purposefully, not as confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady and convincing, with a perceptual signature that blends technical attention (blueprints, drainage, micro-climates) and quiet lyricism. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating nicely between concrete observation and reflective abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the slightly elevated register fits Lena’s introspective, analytic temperament. The voice is distinctive enough to feel memorable without calling undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits a contemplative, twilight discovery. Diction and syntax are controlled, and the narrative distance stays consistent, blending external description with interior reflection smoothly. Occasional abstractions and meta-phrasing nudge the register toward essay at times but don’t break POV credibility. The perceptual signature—an instinct-trained seeker reading architecture and absence—is distinct enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, with a calm, lyrical cadence that matches Mira’s patience and philosophical bent. Diction (e.g., “rosetta stone,” “lightning-born treasure,” “infinitely patient with time’s own knots”) feels plausible for this particular, studious observer and avoids jarring register shifts. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and shorter, anchoring ones, and there is no POV leakage or clumsy exposition. Minor moments of essayistic abstraction are still consistent with her reflective temperament and do not damage the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits both Maren’s sensibility and the material. Diction and rhythm show a distinct texture (“obituaries for the living,” “geographical exile from her own life”) without feeling mannered. Dialogue is slightly elevated but natural enough for these characters and carries clear subtext about control versus surrender. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly elevated, quasi-philosophical texture that fits Cael’s role as a theorizing prince-scholar. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with sensory specifics anchoring more abstract reflections. Dialogue is spare but natural, clearly distinguishing Vashira’s pragmatic caution from Cael’s idealism. There’s mild risk of over-lyricism, yet the POV distance and access remain stable and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a lyrical yet controlled texture that fits Maya’s reflective, ritualistic mindset.

Overall, the perceptual signature—especially in the way fire and water are noticed—is distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits a scientifically minded but imaginative protagonist. Phrases like “realistically imaginative mind” and “sidereal patience” feel like this character’s way of thinking, not generic ornament. The narrative distance remains stable, never slipping into omniscience or expository hand-holding. A few lines skate near abstraction, but overall the perceptual signature is distinct and well managed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient, slightly lyrical voice is consistent and well-controlled, with nice textural touches like “mist remembering water” and “voice like wind through crystal chimes.” POV distance feels stable, mostly filtering cosmic perspective through the Keeper without confusing head-hopping. Dialogue is clean, economically tagged, and distinct enough in register between the mortal characters and the Keeper. The voice doesn’t quite reach truly singular idiosyncrasy, but it’s polished and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent, perceptive sensibility that feels appropriate to a gravestone carver steeped in poetry. Marcus’s dialogue is distinct enough—gentle, instructive, slightly wry—without breaking the tonal unity. The prose modulates well between description, reflection, and spoken lines, and psychic distance shifts smoothly. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and elision around the weeks of training is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a consistent sensibility—precise, tactile, and morally focused—which suits Maren’s character and the story’s concerns. Diction and rhythm are distinctive without drifting into abstraction, and the narrative distance stays steady. Occasionally the narration sounds slightly more essayistic than character-bound (“ethical diligence that had consumed her life”), but not enough to disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady and character-specific, with a lyrical but controlled diction (“velveteen gloom,” “frayed threads of ink”) that suits Marta’s reflective, pattern-seeking mind. POV boundaries are clean; we never slip outside what Marta can plausibly infer or notice. Rhythm varies well between longer, image-rich sentences and tauter statements at key conceptual turns. The prose sounds like one coherent sensibility rather than a generic narrator, and there are no noticeable register jolts.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to a scientifically literate yet imaginative protagonist; the blend of technical and poetic diction feels intentional. Maren’s perceptual signature—seeing glyphs as patterns of past ignorance, thinking in terms of models and probability matrices—is consistent and specific. Expository passages about models and social change are clear, not ponderous, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip into incoherent distances. There’s room for slightly more idiosyncratic rhythm or surprise in the phrasing, but the control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, quietly lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elena’s perceptions (“thistled calm,” “like smoke through fingers”). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and no intrusive authorial explanations or head-hopping. The lyric register fits the speculative, contemplative mode and modulates with the broadcast’s arrival without losing clarity. It’s strong and polished, though not quite distinctive or idiosyncratic enough to feel unmistakable at the highest literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming fuzzy, and clearly filtered through Elena’s sensibility. The prose modulates smoothly between observation, reflection, and charged image, with no POV leakage or explanatory “helper narrator.” Rhythm and diction feel controlled and deliberate, contributing significantly to the story’s somber, uncanny tone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person POV on Marcus is stable and confident, with a distinct perceptual lens (mechanical truth, sediment layers, rational rebellion). Dialogue reads natural for two educated characters under ideological pressure, with Karin’s “abrasive calm” and Marcus’s sardonic distance differentiating voices even as both speak in an elevated register. Occasional expository turns in their speech are noticeable but do not seriously damage the voice or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated register that matches Mrs. Chen’s sensibility and the hushed library setting. Phrases like “traveled stillness” and “subtracting noise” feel like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic prettiness. Dialogue is sparse but clean and purposeful, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The main ceiling is that at times the narrative voice drifts toward a generalized essayistic tone, which slightly erodes the sense of a fully idiosyncratic consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a controlled, lyrical texture that generally suits the premise. Lexicon and rhythm feel coherent with Mara’s reflective, sensory-oriented mind—especially in food and plant-related perceptions. Expository moments (the ban, the science of synaptic plasticity) are folded in smoothly enough that they rarely jar. The voice occasionally leans into declarative theme-statements that slightly break the otherwise lived-in feel but do not undermine POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a pleasing, controlled lyricism (“that peculiar dusk light that made the world seem suspended between day and dreams”). Mira’s perceptual filter and Chen’s dialogue are distinct enough in rhythm and diction to avoid flattening. The narrative confidently balances explanation with image, and psychic distance is steady. A few lines verge on essayistic abstraction, but they do not break the POV or tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinctly tuned to Mara’s way of noticing, with recurring attentiveness to small shifts and repurposed objects. Metaphors like “streetlights blinked awake” and “a shard of hush” feel voice-driven rather than generic lyricism. The therapist mention and “creeping normality” label flirt with contemporary diagnostic language but are grounded in scene and character. POV is stable with no leakage or helping-narrator overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a confident, slightly lyrical narrative texture that feels compatible with Marina’s perception and the speculative premise. The statue’s telepathic speech has a distinct cadence—measured, gently probing—that differentiates it without breaking register. Shifts between external description, interiority, and transmitted memory are clean and easy to follow. A few abstract formulations in the statue’s “philosophical” lines risk slight homogenization of voice but do not meaningfully confuse or flatten POV.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly matches an analytical physicist’s mind without drifting into sterile exposition. Diction balances scientific concepts with concrete, felt images (“a symphony of variables,” “acceleration without destination”), giving the prose a noticeable, character-inflected cadence. Dialogue is clean, economical, and advances both conflict and theme, with Castellano’s voice distinct in its mix of disappointment and challenge. There’s a faint hint of authorial shaping in his more thematic speeches, but it doesn’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyrical but controlled, with phrases like “methodically hopeful” and “saffron quiet as meditation, warm as remembering” giving Mara a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable, and the narrative confidence about what she “knows” (e.g., that a child remembered for fifty years) feels grounded in the story’s magical premise. Rhythm and diction are consistent and well-modulated, with no head-hopping or register breaks. The only minor limit is that the voice, while strong, operates in a familiar contemporary-lyric register rather than something startlingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and distinct, with a curatorial, slightly archaic diction that matches Celeste’s role and the story’s mood. Syntax varies well; lyrical flourishes like “rosewater dread” feel earned rather than ornamental. Limited dialogue is clean and functional, and interior access remains firmly with Celeste. The narrative confidence and controlled lyricism would read comfortably in a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and character-inflected, with technical curiosity and quiet defiance embedded in the diction (“each mechanism a small rebellion against the tyranny of forward momentum”).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and character-filtered, with a gothic-lyric texture that matches Margot’s altered perception. Diction like “silk dragging across gravel” and “lingering luminance” creates a distinct sonic signature without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the advisor’s speech clearly differentiated in rhythm and register from Margot’s. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, though at moments the elevated register flirts with over-stylization.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, confident, and colored by Maren’s technical and sensory preoccupations (resonance, harmonics, currents) in a way that feels character-specific. Lyric touches like “restless euphony” and “sketched resonance” read as part of her mental lexicon rather than authorial imposition. Dialogue is sparse but functional, clearly distinguishing Deren’s conventional caution from Maren’s assured counterintuition. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, supporting immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct texture built from pattern, mapping, and marine imagery, and it stays within what Maren can plausibly perceive. Diction is elevated but coherent for a reflective, scholarly focalizer and modulates effectively around key beats (whistle blows, turtle movement, final resolve). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few explanatory sentences edge toward authorial summary, but they don’t undercut the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person POV is steady and controlled, and the prose has a consistent, mildly elevated register that fits a historian protagonist. Dialogue is clean, goal-driven, and mostly natural, with Hawthorne’s guarded formality contrasted against Elena’s measured persuasion. At times, the narrative voice slides into an almost position-paper cadence when articulating political parallels, which slightly flattens character-specific texture. Overall, though, focalization and voice remain coherent and effective with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Marcus’s sensibility as both surveyor and unofficial archaeologist of feelings. Diction (“archaeologist of abandoned dreams,” “hushed blaze quality”) is elevated but coherent with his reflective temperament and the meditative pace of the scene.

There is no dialogue, but the narrative voice itself has a distinct, memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-matched to a meticulous archivist. Diction choices like “tranquilly perceptive,” “archaeology of meaning,” and “water-pressed wisdom” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)

Diction and imagery (e.g., “dream-smoke,” “luminous torment,” “descending while ascending”) are controlled and consistent without obvious register slips. Interiority and exposition are integrated smoothly into the descriptive flow, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythmic control is strong, with the mantra-like “Transform, polish, fold, release” effectively modulating cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct blend of scientific lexicon and lyrical metaphor that plausibly fits a traumatized atmospheric researcher. Diction like “probability clouds,” “quantum foam,” and “bleak exhilaration” feels character-appropriate rather than authorially imposed. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Vahedi’s line about “ghost hunt” nicely underplays the depth of Mira’s preoccupation. Psychic distance is well controlled, with smooth shifts between sensory immediacy and conceptual reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person close voice around Mara is stable, controlled, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature (technical but wonder-prone, attentive to light, pattern, and signal). Syntax and rhythm vary nicely, and the prose knows when to compress versus linger. Dialogue is spare but efficient, with the pilgrim’s slightly oracular tone contrasting Mara’s more grounded reactions. A few phrases edge toward prompt-like abstraction (“frequency of belonging” repeated as label) but not enough to damage voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited POV stays cleanly in Mara’s perception, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits her reflective, haunted mind. Phrases like “sieved hush” and “sand mixed with salt and sorrow” give the voice texture without overwhelming clarity. Dialogue is economical and natural, carrying subtext (Elias’s regret and anger, her inability to justify herself) and moving the scene forward. The narrative distance occasionally slips toward abstract summary, but not enough to disrupt the coherence of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice around Katrin is steady, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits the gravity of her work without straying into incoherence. Dialogue is clear, goal-directed, and mostly natural, though some of Katrin’s lines edge toward aphorism. POV control is clean—no head-hopping, consistent tense, and a coherent narrative distance. The perceptual signature (attention to liminality, weathered objects, and procedural detail) is present but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person on Marina is stable and well-controlled, with a perceptual signature grounded in navigational metaphors and observational precision. Diction and rhythm feel consistent with her educated, technical background without sliding into jargon; Amy’s dialogue reads younger and more blunt, giving mild but sufficient voice distinction. Sentences modulate rhythm appropriately, slowing for reflection and tightening for decision beats. There’s no head-hopping or distance confusion, and the lyric touches remain anchored in character rather than authorial haze.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and mostly well modulated; it balances concrete description with Marcus’s interior stance. The Interpreter’s dialogue has a distinct cadence (“jaded wonder”) that contrasts with Marcus’s more tentative directness. Occasional lines verge on essayistic (“You think forgetting absolves”), but they mostly stay within a plausible elevated register for this slightly mythic frame. Overall, POV control is clean with a recognizable texture, though not yet highly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, vivid, and appropriately lyrical for the speculative mode, with consistent access to Mira’s perceptions and emotions. Dialogue feels natural yet heightened, and Tam’s slightly more distant, echoing diction fits his ghostly status. Phrases like “cosmic intimacy” recur but feel thematically purposeful rather than tacked-on. The narrative stance occasionally approaches omniscient-lyric abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a character steeped in symbol and ritual; metaphors feel like her way of seeing rather than generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Mei notices history, sorrow, and light. Dialogue between Mei and Akio is spare but natural, clearly differentiated, and advances both theme and conflict. Rhythmic control is strong, especially as the resonance builds and the shimmer spreads, without drifting into opacity. The register sometimes edges into abstract/philosophical, but it remains plausible for Mei and doesn’t disrupt focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without becoming opaque, and maintains a consistent perceptual signature—Mara’s noticing is both concrete and metaphysical. Phrasing like “knew without knowing” and “vibrant hush” is repeated with enough variation and context to feel like motif rather than tic. Dialogue is sparse but natural and upholds status and tone, especially in the brief exchange with the surveyor. The voice feels confident and singular, suitable for a high-end literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is steady and well-controlled, with diction matching a competent, observant sentinel in a quasi-fantastical military setting. Sentences flow cleanly, with occasional nicely turned phrases (“darkness settle like a conspirator's cloak”) that feel consistent with the narrative stance. Dialogue is economical and generally natural, with Voss’s “winking hush” and Maren’s calm responses carrying subtext. The voice, while assured, is more classically genre-fantasy than idiosyncratically distinctive, which keeps it short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative, sacred-geometry premise. Diction like “frictionless deep,” “fog with weight,” and “living equation” creates a distinct texture without losing clarity.

Overall, the perceptual signature—math, pattern, and cosmology rising naturally to the surface of description—is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature (scientific/astronomical and cartographic metaphors braided with political repression). Diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than indulgent, and there is no POV leakage or confusing distance shift. The voice maintains clarity while handling abstract concepts and imagery, especially in the storm and city glimpses. A touch of therapy-language (“vigil in pause... her therapist had called it”) is contextualized and doesn’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident and textured, with a controlled elevated register that fits a steampunk-tinged academic milieu (“diplomatically fierce,” “dignified chaos of academic collaboration”). POV remains stable and plausible; any inference about Harwick’s inner state feels deducible from behavior and dialogue. Dialogue is crisp, goal-driven, and character-distinct—Adelaine’s dry precision contrasts with Harwick’s wounded formality and later humor. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose lively without calling undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending lyric description with clear scene work; Mara’s perception shapes what’s noticed and how it’s framed. Dialogue is natural, with light subtext—Kai’s teasing about her “terrible poetry” carries their history and affection without explanation. The elevated diction in narration (“luminous fracture,” “conceptual repricing” equivalents) feels consistent with the character’s poetic mind rather than authorial intrusion. POV remains stable and trustworthy, with no leakage or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong sensory and metaphorical palette (“horizon began its nightly invitation to darkness,” “suspended above choice itself”). The narrative distance stays stable, and the prose modulation into more charged, rhythmic lines at the climax is controlled rather than overwrought. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and his one line about following the music “between the frames” neatly echoes the established motif. Overall, the voice feels particular rather than generic, supporting the story’s atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending lyricism with grounded observation in a way that suits Kima’s rational-yet-awed sensibility. Dialogue between Kima and Prem feels natural and goal-driven, revealing tension without over-explaining.

There’s strong modulation of rhythm around key beats, though not quite at an exceptional, signature level.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends Mira’s sensibility with a gentle narrative intelligence. Imagery like “each word arriving like a wave lapping against stone” and “diffuse through Mira’s consciousness like ink in water” feels organic to the piece’s maritime/bonsai lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but clean and purposeful, and Takeo’s slow, metaphor-rich speech differentiates him without slipping into caricature. Psychic distance is well managed, allowing reflective language without losing scene presence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is generally consistent and lyrical, but it stumbles significantly when integrating the required phrase "quietly savvy" in the climax ("felt quietly savvy understanding bloom"), which disrupts the rhythm and logic. The reliance on expository dialogue to convey the backstory and future limits the voice's distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the protagonist's spoken "lectures" with the prose style. However, the conceit of narrating aloud to an empty room creates a stilted, artificial register that distances the reader. The voice control is evident, but the stylistic choice feels like a convenient workaround for exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a thriller tone, though it occasionally slips into melodrama. The dialogue carries too much expository weight, sounding like plot conveyance rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for a thoughtful mechanic, managing technical details well. However, dialogue tends toward the expository, with characters articulating plot points and themes too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("hush of unstruck chords," "truest form") that distances the reader. The narrative stance is functional, though the emotional beats feel performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, maintaining a stable third-person limited view.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mythic, fable-like voice is consistent and suits the material. However, reliance on filter verbs ("felt the hum," "could feel") and abstract descriptors creates unnecessary distance in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mellow, fitting the therapist persona, but suffers from "therapy-speak" and sentimental abstractions ("space between notes where ordinary magic breathed"). The POV filters the world through a lens of soft acceptance that dulls the dramatic edge of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly reverent, relying on abstract descriptors ("bronze quiet," "axis of connection") to convey significance. The narrative distance is close but leans heavily on "telling" Miren's emotions ("Miren cared," "Miren's breath caught") rather than showing them through distinct behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a melancholic, precise tone suited to the protagonist. However, the psychic distance often drifts into explanatory summary, telling the reader about the world and history rather than staying anchored in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, suiting the "techno-theological" tone of the piece. The distance is managed well, though the focus on abstract concepts occasionally distances the reader from the visceral danger.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative tone that suits the subject matter. The transition between the present moment and the grandfather's memory is handled smoothly without jarring POV shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the magical realist tone. Control slips slightly with "writerly" phrasing ("defiant rays," "cotton candy and regret"), but the rhythmic cadence generally supports the gravity motif.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality. The POV remains securely anchored in Oskar’s experience of deafness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a steady, observant distance appropriate for the character. The shift into scientific observation at the end is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Maren’s sensory experience, though a few moments of internalization lean slightly towards sentimental explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Marcus's poetic sensibility. The tone is maintained well, though the transition to Sarah's dialogue feels slightly less distinct than the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the elegiac mood, maintaining a stable distance. At times, the register leans into slightly precious phrasing ("trap it in a single form," "beauty persisted"), but it generally serves the story's atmospheric intent well.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, "professionally thorough" detachment that cracks just enough to let the sensory epiphany shine through. The integration of technical scent-work vocabulary with lyrical observation creates a distinct and memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is competent but relies on familiar literary registers ("thick with meaning") and overt internal reporting ("Marianne understood immediately"). The POV filters the world adequately but lacks a distinct, pressure-hardened perceptual signature, often resorting to explaining emotions rather than embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice violates the third-person limited perspective by suppressing the focal character's knowledge to trick the reader. Kael "dedicating herself not to solving the mystery alone" implies she *is* trying to solve it, which is false if she created it; this dishonesty breaks trust in the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is polished, atmospheric, and consistent, effectively blending technical observation with a sense of wonder. The close third-person POV maintains a steady hand, managing the transition between the mechanical and the magical smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending mathematical precision with lyrical description to match the protagonist. The register occasionally drifts into abstract density ("dovetailed quantum uncertainty") that briefly obscures the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally leans into sentimental elevation ("held it like scripture," "blue whisper") that filters the immediacy of the experience. The POV remains stable, though the emotional resonance feels slightly performed rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and well-calibrated to Maya’s background, blending scientific observation ("variables," "data") with a burgeoning appreciation for the wild. The distance is controlled, keeping the reader firmly within her introspective processing without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "aftermath" tone. However, it leans on abstract, writerly phrasing ("navigated absences") that distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a steady third-person limited perspective. There is a tendency toward "storyteller" exposition (explaining the meaning of the hour or the cracks) which slightly distances the reader from the immediate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the tone well. However, it relies on filtering and explanatory telling ("She was a sympathetic skeptic," "impossible, absurd") rather than trusting the reader to infer reaction from behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("hushed thunder"). Narrative distance is controlled, but the "ancient" tone sometimes feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, effectively filtering the scene through Mara’s analytical, meticulous worldview. The shift to a slightly more sentimental register at the end ("calculating the odds of his resurrection") works well, though the dialogue occasionally stiffens into speechifying.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and meditative, perfectly suiting the "gilded-leaf stationer" persona. The narrative distance is controlled, staying close to her perceptions of frequency and texture without unmotivated slips.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a cohesive atmospheric pressure that matches the setting. Phrasing like "domesticated death into garden maintenance" demonstrates strong control over tone and subtext. The perspective remains tightly filtered through Maya’s specific experience of displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent, somewhat lyrical voice that fits the sentimental tone, though the dialogue occasionally stiffens into instructional speeches ("Truth is only what you can measure"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tendency to explain the protagonist's emotions ("She'd come... to prove her grandmother wrong") reduces intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the raft city. It maintains a stable POV, though the reliance on internal explanation ("Marina understood," "she knew exactly") creates a slight psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, balancing scientific precision with elegiac reflection. The tone matches the "dawnlit melancholy" requirement without slipping into melodrama. The pacing aligns well with the ticking clock mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person POV maintains a consistent and polished voice, effectively filtering the world through Mara’s non-visual perception. The lyrical tone fits the "magnetic calm" of the character, though it occasionally verges on preciousness ("reverently," "sacred"). Narrative distance is well-controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is stable but relies on distancing filter verbs ("Mira watched," "Petrov studied"). The verbatim repetition of descriptor phrases suggests a lack of control over the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the genre well. However, it occasionally creates distance through diagnostic telling ("understanding that true restoration cannot be rushed") rather than embodied observation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and professional. The voice falters in dialogue naturalism, particularly when characters speak in complete, thematic sentences during a life-or-death emergency, damaging the sense of urgent reality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of melancholic wonder suitable for the magical realism genre. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the focus tight on Matthias's perception. The dialogue is functional, though the attribution tags ("the oldest one said," "another prisoner replied") become slightly repetitive during the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is serviceable, but the dialogue suffers from heavy exposition and forced prompt integration ("I was lovingly venomous"). The ghost's speech patterns read as written prose designed to convey backstory quickly, lacking the naturalism or distinct idiom of a centuries-old entity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone that suits the fable-like structure. Control over narrative distance is steady, effectively managing the passage of time and the meditative quality of the weaver's work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent close-third perspective that aligns with Mirelle’s observant nature.

The tone balances the scientific/observatory context with the spy/thriller elements without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, fitting the magical realism genre. Narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Meera’s perception. The dialogue, while functional, occasionally drifts into expository "therapy-speak" regarding the mechanics of the moment, which flattens the mystique established by the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The POV is securely anchored in Maricel’s professional deformation, consistently filtering the world through the lens of translation and encryption. The voice is distinct, though the mandatory phrase "lotus-hearted knowledge" feels stylistically incongruous with the otherwise sharp, observational tone.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but occasionally overly explanatory, telling the reader how to interpret Elias ("speaking truths wrapped in deliberate obscurity") rather than letting his speech stand on its own. The POV shifts from Elias to a collective focus at the end are managed well enough, but the "candidly cryptic" descriptor feels like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the fable-like mode without slipping into incongruous registers. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining a close but slightly mythic focus on the poet's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, carrying a melancholic but precise texture that suits the archival setting.

    The narrative voice is consistent and generally controlled. The perspective stays firmly with Senna, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into expository functionality to explain the scientific premise.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, with a lyrical, melancholic quality. The "cheerful gloom" oxymoron serves as a distinct tonal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but drifts into authorial philosophy ("liminal hour," "grammar of ordinary things") that distances the reader from Martin’s distinct perspective. The transition from sensory observation to abstract essayism feels seamless but artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice often slides into authorial poetry ("ancient choreography," "patient inevitability") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose. The narrative distance is generally controlled, but the shift to collective consciousness ("They spoke in unison") breaks the grounded reality established by the brass gauge. The tone matches the "fable" quality but lacks grit.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "drowning city" vibe. However, immersion is periodically broken by expository filtering and "helpful narrator" syndrome, particularly the clunky characterization of Maya's "sensitively perceptive nature," which summarizes her traits instead of trusting the reader to infer them from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like quality of the story. The prose maintains a steady rhythm that mimics the "lullaby" aspect of the plot, though it risks becoming monotone.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally authoritative and reflective, but it is undercut by visible grammatical slips that erode the persona's precision. The tone balances the technical and the mythic well, but the errors distract.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.0)

Interiority is often filtered through "she realized" or "she recognized" rather than direct sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but inconsistent in distance, shifting from Kale's immediate sensory experience to omniscient exposition about Mira's techniques and the brother's internal biology. The tone wavers between mythic fable and sci-fi explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lyrical voice is well-controlled and suits the ethereal subject matter without slipping into purple prose. The narrative distance remains stable, though the brother's dialogue ("I found where all boundaries end") leans slightly toward the melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately solemn for the mythic tone of the story. However, it maintains a safe, somewhat generic distance that prevents deep immersion in Kael's physical distress.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the fantasy setting ("glass-song," "shards of hush").

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.9)

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suited to the "dynasty" subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a consistent contemplative distance. However, the interiority occasionally slips into an expository "artist statement" register ("scaffold complexity with simplicity") that tells rather than shows the character's mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)

    The narrative voice is stable and suitably melancholic, maintaining a consistent tone. However, the dialogue frequently lapses into "as-you-know" exposition or thematic declaration ("I want to rediscover what we lost"), which flattens the distinctness of the speakers.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative for a poet character, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality. The dialogue serves the theme efficiently but reads somewhat instructionally, lacking the messy cadence of genuine grief.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a tone of reverence. However, the reliance on summary ("Maren noticed changes," "she understood") keeps the narrative distance too high for deep engagement. The voice describes the experience rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting the contemplative sci-fi tone. Elara’s perspective filters the world consistently (noticing "overgrown monuments" and "layers of mud"). No head-hopping or distance slips; the POV remains tightly anchored in her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistently maintains a mythic, slightly archaic tone that suits the subject matter. The translation of bird calls into human speech patterns is handled smoothly, maintaining the story's internal logic without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a melancholic tone suitable for the genre. However, the perspective creates distance, summarizing Calder's emotional state ("Mercy watched her master weep") rather than inhabiting the visceral experience of the discovery.

    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative tone. The psychic distance is controlled, keeping the reader firmly in Maya's perspective, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly elevated abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the genre, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness with phrases like "sacredly playful." The POV is stable, but the dialogue feels stylized to the point of artificiality, serving the theme more than character realism.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent literary register that suits the contemplative tone. However, the dialogue between Mira and the archivist feels unnatural and stagey ("You're walking words," "They don't capture what actually happened to us"), functioning more as thematic exposition than human conversation. The POV remains firmly with Mira, filtering the world effectively through her historian's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the surreal subject matter. The rhythm is generally strong, though a few descriptors ("colors that had no names") feel like placeholders rather than the specific, fresh observations found elsewhere in the piece (e.g., "dust that tasted of forgotten civilizations").

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, assured, and appropriately elevated to match the "old master" protagonist. The filter is tightly controlled, blending observation with memory seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately urgent, matching the breathless constraint of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The contemplative voice remains consistent and tightly filtered through Maren's artistic perspective. The distance calibration effectively mirrors her shift from aloofness to presence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.0)
    A severe artifact ("'Wait,' Background said") shatters the POV, substituting a placeholder or generation error for the protagonist's name at the pivotal moment. Dialogue feels artificial and didactic, with characters speaking in thematic thesis statements rather than natural, goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the story's melancholic atmosphere. The distance is managed well, keeping close to Mara’s perception while allowing the scope of the world’s decline to filter through naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like tale. The tone balances the antique/academic elements with the magical setting well. It only falters slightly when relying on abstract labels to define the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, though it occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("lover's reverence," "mathematical poem"). The dialogue feels staged to deliver exposition rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending a melancholic tone with the necessary clinical detachment of the protagonist's profession. The prose maintains a stable POV, though it occasionally slips into over-explanation ("The irony wasn't lost on her") rather than trusting the reader to infer the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is polished and consistent, successfully maintaining a meditative tone appropriate for the setting. However, it occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("drowning heartbeat") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is precise and controlled, mirroring the "obsessive accuracy" of the protagonist while allowing space for the surreal elements to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stylized, often distancing the reader with "writerly" phrasing ("rumor made flesh"). The dialogue frequently functions as thematic exposition ("The thing about loneliness is...") rather than natural, goal-driven speech, reducing character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, maintaining a specific "mapmaker" lexicon throughout. It occasionally drifts into abstraction or slightly elevated poeticism that creates distance ("conjugation of moonlight"), but the perceptual signature remains stable and appropriate for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice controls the distance perfectly, blending scientific precision with poetic intuition suitable for the slipstream genre.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.3)
    The POV is stable, but the voice tends toward breathlessness and melodrama ("orchestra of absence"). The narrative distance is consistent, though it frequently summarizes emotion rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, but the dialogue drifts into artificiality. Marquez's line about the "hush of the universe inhaling" reads like authorial poetry rather than natural speech, breaking character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The distinction between Marcus's theatrical &quot;narrator&quot; voice and his internal pain is handled with precise control, creating a unique perceptual signature. The voice modulation between the flat, affectless narration and the breaking point serves the emotional arc perfectly. No head-hopping or stability issues.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and prone to "purple" phrasing ("reverence of a lantern-moth"). Dialogue feels artificial and expository, serving as a platform for the characters to explain the story's concepts to each other rather than sounding like natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the story with controlled distance. The shift between objective description and Maya's internal sensory experience (values vs. colors) is handled smoothly and distinctively.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, effectively blending technical and acoustic imagery. However, the POV distance renders the volunteer opaque, and the "powerfully gentle" phrasing jars against the otherwise controlled diction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)

    The voice aims for a high, meditative register but occasionally slips into purple prose ("air... like a confession") or clunky phrasing. The tone is consistent, but the narrative distance sometimes feels too remote from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone ("luminous regret"), fitting the atmospheric setting.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, matching the character's reflective state. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("ocean of peer review," "two languages"), which distances the reader from the raw reality of the scientific failure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical yet grounded tone that fits the "morphine fog" and the quiet intensity of the tower. The perspective stays firmly with Mara, filtering the world through her obsession and pain.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like tone, though it relies heavily on stock phrasing ("silent songs," "unspoken words") that keeps the reader at a distance.

The dialogue reads as stiff and expository rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, suiting the fable mode. However, the dialogue often feels artificial and stylized, reading more like written prose or aphorisms than natural speech, even within the context of magical guides.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone ("Tuesday that might have been a Thursday"), which suits the genre but creates excessive psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The POV is stable and maintains a consistent, authoritative tone suited to an elder protagonist. Narrative distance is well-controlled, though the reliance on summary for the decoding process creates a slight distance in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the cold isolation of the setting. It occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("the library seemed to exhale") that draws attention to the writing rather than the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptive, fitting the protagonist's worldview perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a ghost story, maintaining a unified tone. However, the POV creates distance; we are told about Margaux's desperation and the "fractured" time rather than experiencing the disorientation viscerally through the prose structure or her immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    The POV is consistent but overly helpful, prioritizing explanation of the magic system over immediate experience. The narrative distance collapses into summary to articulate the character's thoughts ("she dismissed it as hitchhiker philosophy").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical vocabulary from two disparate fields effectively. The score is limited only by the dialogue in the middle section, which drifts into expository functionality rather than maintaining the naturalism established in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but relies on familiar "literary sci-fi" mannerisms and stock phrasing ("haunted ambition," "eternal song").

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, intellectual, and controlled, perfectly suiting the "ego death" protagonist. The POV remains stable and perceptive ("fragmented into philosophical problem"), though the emotional distance is palpable, fitting the character but slightly chilling the connection.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and professional, though a paragraph of summary exposition regarding the escape room's success interrupts the scene's immediate momentum. The shift from sensory details to resume-like backstory creates a brief distance in the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, effectively blending the mechanical with the emotional. At times, it leans into heavy personification ("rooms that had forgotten how to hold joy") that borders on sentimental, but the tone generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and precise. It leans heavily into the scholarly aspect of the character ("interiorizing exteriors"), which slightly distances the reader from the "feral" physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("air itself tasted of disappointment") and melodramatic phrasing. While the tone matches the high-fantasy setting, the narration often filters the experience through adjectives rather than direct sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "fantasy" aspect of the tone, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("mathematical poetry," "shard of hush"). The POV remains securely with Mira. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the tendency to over-explain internal realizations dampens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is stable, but the voice is hampered by abstract phrasing ("creeping wrongness") and functional dialogue. The narration creates distance through summary rather than immersing the reader in the deckhand’s immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone that suits the "rational enchantment" concept well. There is a tendency toward explanatory filtering ("Marina understood this language") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully maintains the required "somber marvel" tone throughout. The POV is firmly anchored in Carta's perception, though the alien's dialogue leans slightly into standard tropes of the cryptic mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a melancholic, lyrical tone appropriate for the genre. However, the POV creates distance by filtering emotional resonance through professional competence, preventing the reader from feeling the raw edge of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, matching the snowy isolation. The shift to the "digital ghost" concept is handled with good tonal control, though the pacing feels slightly rushed during the climactic data recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a fable-like distance appropriate for the genre. However, the tone stays safe and mono-dimensional, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that would separate Mira’s view from a generic narrator's. The perspective is stable, but the psychic distance is too remote to generate visceral empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, scholarly, and slightly lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. It effectively manages the shift from observation to metaphysical realization, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("swallowed light," "pierced the indigo sky"). The point of view is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like genre. It maintains a steady distance and tone, though it occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("hush of budding hope") that draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the magical realism genre. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She could feel," "She saw") and summary explanations distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and stable, maintaining a suitable distance that matches the "routine sorrow" of the setting. The shift to a more hopeful interiority is handled smoothly without breaking the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)

A few filter verbs ("noticed," "understood") distance the reader slightly at pivotal moments, preventing a higher score. The internal monologue successfully balances the technical and the lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone suited to the fairy-tale atmosphere. It effectively manages the third-person perspective, though the interiority sometimes feels more expository than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and fitting for a soft sci-fi fable, though the POV drifts into omniscience to describe collective settler feelings ("something in the messages felt strangely trustworthy"). The shift to Kessa's perspective at the end further distances the reader from Mara’s interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reverent tone appropriate for the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the genre. Narrative distance is controlled, though the tone occasionally drifts into slightly purple descriptors ("bark rough as grief") that draw attention to the writing rather than the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent, slightly melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. Interiority is well-managed. Dialogue is functional but occasionally drifts into expository thematic statement ("To sandpaper the rough memories smooth"), which feels less natural than the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like setting. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("hush of borrowed starlight" used repetitively) which distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and the technical lexicon fits the character's background. However, the tone occasionally drifts into breathless melodrama ("moonlit cathedral," "ocean of possibility") that reduces the immediacy of the scientific work.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, though it occasionally slips into explanatory "telling" to justify the magic system. The narrative distance remains static, observing Lyra's competence rather than inhabiting her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, fitting the fable-like quality of the piece. However, it occasionally relies on abstract summaries of emotion ("symphonic possibility") rather than strictly embodied perception, creating a slight distance from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending a slightly elevated fantasy register with the protagonist's introspective nature. The perspective stays firmly with Kavir, filtering the world through his "thoughtfully precise" history.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and gentle, fitting the fable-like mode, though it maintains a high psychic distance that keeps the reader observing Mira rather than inhabiting her. The shift to a collective "us" in the dialogue at the end feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent, blending technical pilot terminology with a slightly elevated, mythic tone appropriate for the setting. Narrative distance is controlled well during the inversion maneuvers.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical observation ("anemometer array") with a melancholic, reflective tone that suits the setting. The POV remains firmly anchored in Mara’s perspective, filtering the surreal environment through her specific professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but leans into purple prose ("colors bloom from silence itself") that creates distance; the synesthetic focus is maintained but occasionally feels like a catalogue of effects rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent for the mythic tone. It maintains a stable POV, though it occasionally slips into abstraction ("spaces between worlds") rather than staying grounded in Maren's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable-like sci-fi tone perfectly. The shift in internal rhythm when she adopts the mathematician’s persona is a subtle, effective touch that demonstrates control over psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent and the voice is appropriate for a fantasy fable, with a smooth, somewhat lyrical rhythm. There are no technical slips or head-hopping. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate it from standard genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice aims for a lyrical, fable-like tone but is tripped up by jarring prompt phrases like "stoically sparkling" that clash with the established rhythm. The POV is stable, but the register drifts into purple prose ("reality wore gossamer") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and polished, suited to the mythic quality of the tale. There are moments of "telling" ("She worked in the timeframe...") that feel slightly expository, but the overall tone supports the story's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the distance well, maintaining a suitably melancholic tone. It leans occasionally into sentimental register ("luminescent ache," "whispered to him"), but the POV remains stable and the focus is disciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the "storm herald" persona, managing the transition between technical details and magical realism well. However, reliance on filter verbs ("he thought," "he saw") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate experience of the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a tone of reverent wonder throughout. However, the dialogue creates a "voice convergence" issue where both the narrator and Chen speak in the same elevated, metaphorical register, reducing character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and stable, maintaining a cohesive "mundane fantasy" tone throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into sentimental territory ("whisper of melancholy," "soft as silk") that flattens the emotional impact of the observations.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and suitably melancholic, but the phrase "heuristically gentle" is a significant register error that clashes with the fable-like quality. It reads as an intrusion of academic/technical diction into a magical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a polished, fable-like tone appropriate for the setting. Perspective stays firmly anchored in Maren’s worldview, though the emotional register occasionally drifts into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a polished noir tone that suits the subject matter. Perspective is strictly maintained, though the "comforting unease" descriptor leans slightly into telling rather than evoking the specific feeling through texture.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "purple" description ("data streams made manifest," "terrestrially cosmic") that distances the reader. The "luminous skeptic" label feels like authorial intrusion rather than an organic part of Mira's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the protagonist's burden. However, the POV occasionally uses distancing filters ("Elena understood then," "Elena recognized") that explain the character's state instead of immersing the reader in her immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, fitting the atmospheric constraints. However, the tone leans into generic dystopian registers without establishing a distinct, rhythmic perceptual signature for Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic precision that blends technical diction ("western quadrant," "neural network") with poetic longing ("darkness captured in a sealed vial"). The transition between the clinical observation of the burn and the emotional weight of the memory is seamless, maintaining POV stability while deepening intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is polished but distant, relying on "writerly" abstractions ("noise of the world," "scatter them like dust") rather than close, distinct character perception. The tone is consistent but lacks a unique perceptual signature, reading more like a standard fable than a specific lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is polished and lyrical, suiting the protagonist's nature. However, the POV relies heavily on summary and explanation of methods rather than immersing the reader in the immediate sensory experience of the crisis or task.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, melancholic, and confident, maintaining a consistent tone that suits the magical realism. Perception is filtered strictly through Maris's obsession and expertise, creating a strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("curved like ancient spines"). The integration of technical prompt terms ("progressive disclosure," "webs of intrigue") creates jarring register clashes with the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, intelligent, and consistent with Vera's analytical nature. The prose texture effectively conveys her perspective, though the mechanics of the puzzle-solving scene feel slightly dry and functional compared to the atmospheric opening.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.6)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("groaned its twilight song," "fleshly ethereal knowing"). The use of "literally" in narration to emphasize a physical sensation disrupts the established elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought, leaning into performative phrasing like "velvet grave" and "aggressive clarity."

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a tone of focused, slightly lyrical observation that fits the "pioneering" concept. There is a tendency to filter experience through "telling" labels ("irreverent awe," "impossible longing") which distances the reader slightly from the raw sensation of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, filtering the world effectively through Elena's obsessive, archiving mindset. The voice maintains a melancholic precision that suits the cold-case subject matter, with no slips in distance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, carrying a mythic, fable-like quality that suits the setting. However, the narrative distance renders the emotional beats slightly abstract, keeping the reader observing Maren rather than inhabiting her anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, frequently telling the reader how to interpret moments ("reverent fingers," "beautiful, necessary work") rather than trusting the scene. The perspective remains distant and fable-like, which prevents intimacy with the focal character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and well-tuned to the protagonist's scholarly nature, maintaining a consistent "fable-like" quality. The shift from clinical observation to poetic realization is handled smoothly without breaking the established tone.

The perceptual signature—seeing the world through the lens of decay and dissolving media—is distinct and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent elevated tone that suits the subject matter. The technical lexicon ("spectrographs," "escape velocity") blends smoothly with the more lyrical passages, creating a cohesive and authoritative POV.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, balancing the analytical tone of a doctor with the repressed emotion of a grieving mother. The POV remains tightly anchored in Marianne’s perspective, filtering the magical elements through her skeptical lens effectively.

The rhythm of the prose supports the pacing well.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "star watcher" persona well. However, the POV distance slips during the summary of the children, moving from intimate interiority to a broader, almost omniscient narrator summing up the character's life impact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the material. However, it leans on telling over showing for internal states ("Cassian's heart quickened"), creating a slight distance from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, reverent, and appropriately paced for the atmospheric content. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally dips into "purple" description ("photons that had witnessed the birth of galaxies") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like structure. However, it leans into expository telling to convey significance (“Marcus understood something they didn’t”) rather than allowing the action to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately contemplative for the pacing. It maintains a steady distance that suits the stoic tone. There is no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature—an engineer seeing flow and structure—is distinct, though it occasionally drifts into slightly generic "writerly" observation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, employing a lyrical, slightly melancholic tone that suits the "scribe" persona. Control over psychic distance is maintained well, keeping the focus tight on the protagonist's perception without unmotivated head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is polished, controlling distance well and maintaining a consistent tone that suits the magical realism. The intellectual, slightly lyrical style aligns perfectly with the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, meditative tone that suits the protagonist’s archival work. The POV remains tightly focused on Mira, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly purple descriptions ("gray embrace," "world holding its breath") that soften the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, but the dialogue suffers from "thematic echo," where characters speak in essayistic thesis statements rather than natural speech. This reduces the distinctness of the characters and feels somewhat performative.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but monophonic; Vashira and the narrator share the same elevated, lyrical register, making them hard to distinguish. The dialogue often functions as a vehicle for the prompt's required phrases or thematic signaling rather than organic speech.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dialogue is highly unnatural, reading like written speeches rather than spoken interaction ("not a melody anyone chooses, but music nonetheless"). The voices of the two characters merge into a single, elevated poetic register without distinct idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a lyrical, reflective tone suitable for the genre. However, it relies occasionally on "telling" the protagonist's state ("insisting through silence that she belonged here") rather than trusting the action to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and creates a cohesive fable atmosphere ("wind through crystal chimes"), though it occasionally drifts into grandiosity. Dialogue tends toward the expository, serving to articulate themes rather than reveal character through subtext, resulting in a somewhat lecture-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and polished, with a lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the dialogue leans heavily into "writerly" exposition, with characters speaking in thematic thesis statements rather than natural speech. The POV remains stable, though the interiority is often expository.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somber and reflective tone appropriate for the subject. The POV stays tightly anchored in Maren’s physical and emotional experience. The transition from the mechanical act to the emotional release is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a close third-person distance that tracks Marta's mental state. At times, the tone veers into overwrought imagery (e.g., the silo as a "finger pressed to cosmic lips"), but it generally suits the reflective, nocturnal setting.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, blending academic precision with fantasy elements. However, reliance on filter verbs ("she described," "she wrote") during the climax creates distance, summarizing the act of creation rather than immersing the reader in it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality. Narrative distance is controlled, though occasional filter verbs ("She saw them," "She heard") distance the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, melancholic control that suits the surreal environment perfectly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, though it leans slightly into expository interiority when summarizing the founder's philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a meditative, slightly elevated register that suits Marcus’s philosopher persona without becoming purple. The distance is well-managed, keeping us firmly in his interpretive frame.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, utilizing abstract poeticisms ("traveled stillness," "static of inherited anger") that distance the reader from the immediate scene. The use of the epithet "The harmonious choir teacher" in the final paragraph breaks the close third-person intimacy, signaling a shift to a fable-like distance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.6)
    The fable-like narrative voice is consistent and clear, though it struggles slightly to integrate the required scientific jargon naturally into the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the fable-like tone well. Dialogue is functional but occasionally drifts into unnatural exposition to serve the thematic delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent—reverent, quiet, and observational. It occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("inadvertently profound," "sanctify these hollow spaces") that feels slightly precious but fits the protagonist’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent, successfully blending Marina’s perspective with the statue's intrusive thoughts. The distinction between the statue’s "incisive kindness" and Marina’s historian voice is handled well, avoiding confusion even during the telepathic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, appropriately academic register that fits a physicist's internal monologue. The prompt-mandated phrase "balancedly daring" is integrated somewhat awkwardly, appearing twice as a label rather than an organic description. Otherwise, the POV is stable and the distance is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly focalized on Mara. The transition from observation to visionary daydream is handled smoothly without confusing the reader. The tone matches the magical realist content perfectly, maintaining a consistent "saffron quiet" texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone that fits the protagonist's background. Interiority and description blend seamlessly to advance the narrative without expository lumps.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent tone of "bleak exhilaration" appropriate for the protagonist. The shift in the stone's text ("Me, see you...") is a clever voice-driven device to show the breakdown of causality. The distance is maintained effectively throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by heavy-handed labeling (&quot;photographically cursed&quot;) and jarring diction shifts (&quot;unbosom herself&quot;) that feel forced. The perspective remains stable, but the tone wavers between gothic atmosphere and mechanical plot advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated tone that suits the "prophet" persona. The integration of technical terms like "fractal" into this voice is generally smooth, though the prompt-required phrasing occasionally feels slightly conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately observant, fitting the "scholar" archetype with a detached but urgent tone. The psychic distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally drifts into slightly elevated abstraction ("patient geometry") rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    Narrative voice is consistent but didactic; dialogue often reads as a thematic thesis ("revelation would destabilize everything") rather than natural character interaction. POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately elevated for the subject matter. The POV remains firmly anchored in Marcus’s perception. A few moments of filter ("reminded him," "feeling") distance the reader slightly during otherwise immersive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, studious tone that aligns with the protagonist's profession. The perspective is stable, though it occasionally slips into slightly elevated, romanticized diction regarding the "rebellion" that feels distinct from the indexer's logical baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent atmospheric control that blends the lyrical with the technical. The integration of science-fantasy diction ("quantum space," "stratosphere") within a tea-garden setting creates a distinct, intelligent texture. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mei's perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.7)
    Narrative voice is distinct and lyrically controlled, fitting the mournful tone. However, dialogue often slips into unnatural exposition to accommodate prompt phrases ("Unfiltered awakening," she replied), breaking the scene's verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but leans heavily into explanatory telling ("Mara realized with a start," "something in her chest already knew"). The distance is consistent, but the voice lacks a distinct texture or rhythmic signature specific to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably somber, maintaining a cohesive mood. However, the reliance on labeling emotions ("panic," "regret") rather than evoking them through action creates a slight distance in the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into overwrought descriptors ("furrowed hush") or academic abstraction ("liminal space"). The dialogue feels stagey, functioning more to deliver exposition than to capture natural speech patterns under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is generally stable and reflective, fitting the melancholic tone. However, the voice wobbles when accommodating required phrases, shifting from organic observation to somewhat stiff construction ("merrily melancholic in the way of all beginnings").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent and somber, fitting the noir-sci-fi tone. However, the Interpreter functions largely as an exposition delivery system, lacking a distinct voice beyond the "mysterious oracle" archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fairy-tale atmosphere. The POV stays firmly with Mira, filtering the world through her specific history as a beast whisperer, which grounds the magical elements in her personal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic register that fits the fable-like quality of the story. Control over psychic distance is excellent, zooming in from the impossible landscape to the intimacy of the "tiny print" on the cloth. The prose rhythm supports the emotional gravity without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific detachment with melancholy effectively ("peculiar lightness," "ghostly resolve"). The tone matches the "twilight of the species" content well.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the atmospheric intent well. However, the psychic distance collapses into abstract summary during key moments, explaining Mara's intuition ("she knew without knowing") rather than immersing the reader in the sensory or cognitive experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent. However, Maren and Voss share a similar "knowing" voice, and the dialogue occasionally drifts into expository declarations rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical elevation that suits the mythic science-fantasy tone. The perspective stays firmly with Korin, effectively filtering the world through her burden of prescience, though the certainty of her visions flattens the emotional texture of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a poetic affectation that occasionally breaks immersion. Phrases like "storm-kissed wonder" feel tonally jarring against the disciplined, gritty reality of the darkroom timer and the censorship.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is polished, consistent, and tonally appropriate for the "academic fantasy" aesthetic. The focus remains tightly anchored to Adelaine’s perspective, blending her intellectual rigor with her sensory experience of the atrium. The dialogue captures the specific "diplomatically fierce" idiom well.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice aligns perfectly with the "penny poet" persona—lyrical but slightly detached, fitting the "September" clarity. The prose maintains a consistent texture that supports the "luminous fracture" tone without slipping into overwriting. Internal transitions between the planting action and the reflection on her past selves are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and wistful tone that suits the genre and setting. The third-person limited perspective stays close to the protagonist, though it occasionally slips into summarizing emotions ("She was desperate") rather than dramatizing them through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending a slightly clinical observational style ("empirically whimsical") with lyrical longing suitable for the fable-like quality of the story. The POV remains tightly anchored in Kima’s perspective, filtering the world effectively through her specific anxieties and professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the sentimental tone well, though it often prioritizes poetic cadence over clarity. The "wistful exposition" mode is sustained, but the high level of abstraction creates a distance between the reader and the raw emotion of the severance.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close maintains a scientist’s diction—“overlapping shingles of chitin,” “decay curves”—yet modulates into lyrical compression at pressure points (“light could linger…”). Rhythm mirrors process: longer periodic sentences for cataloguing, clipped fragments for realization. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature; it holds. Filter verbs minimal; “she understood” once, but justified by final conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Vera’s sensory filtration—‘luminous glass’, ‘drifting resonance’—with perceptual signature sustained; the prose modulates from meditative canyon opening to compressed cave confrontation, earning the rhythmic shift. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is undertaker-tired: clauses weighted like lead, rhythm slowing under pressure (“He worked for days or hours—time flowed strangely here”). Perceptual signature precise—Marcel catalogs sensations as an embalmer would, noticing decay, stillness, refraction. Lexicon stays within his diction; no head-hopping. Compression in later paragraphs mirrors his fading stamina, teaching the pattern and paying off in the emptied dream-space.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile—palm on silver, clay grit, engine wheeze. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under risk (“She rang it three times”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within Mara’s lived lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays tightly fused to Mei’s perceptions; diction—“foggy lucidity,” “prayers made visible”—is lyrical yet consistent with an artist who sees metaphorically. Rhythm breathes with scene temps: longer sentences at twilight bloom, clipped exchanges with the pilgrim. No dialogue clutter; when he speaks, syntax is oracular, suiting mythic status. Compression (“three months ago...”) is strategic and anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric hovers at middle-distance, able to slip into synesthetic physics—“golden streams hung suspended”—yet stay rooted in moss underfoot. Syntax elongates then fractures mirroring backward time-slips: long anacoluthon clauses snap into single-line staccato beats. No head-hop; every perception is Lyra-filtered. Diction stays within her surveyor lexicon until “hyperbolic geometry” is correctly—if densely—deployed; one archaisms (“silver halide”) is earned by photo context.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV stays tight interior with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is patient, tactile, agri-science literate—“chromatic sequence,” “drought-resistant strains.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during escape, mirroring breath. No dialogue to judge; narration avoids filter verbs, maintains vivid diction within plausible lexicon. Voice modulates but never fractures under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice carries distinct synesthetic perceptual signature: “burgundy crackle,” “silver whisper,” “green and violet ribbons that whisper.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences under aurora, then staccato tremble at drop moment—without algorithmic pattern. POV distance remains tight third; no head-hop or knowledge overreach. Dialogue absent by design; narrative diction stays within Mira’s plausible sensorial lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s painter-attuned perceptions; metaphoric diction (“light pooled thick as honey,” “shadows into liquid pools”) feels character-native rather than ornamental. Psychic distance modulates with pressure, compressing as the moonbeam vision hits. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Celeste’s “You saw it, then” carries the whole reversal without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Marcus’s glassblower perception: flame “kisses,” glass “collapses under stillness,” diction stays technical yet tender. Rhythm mimics rod rotation—long sentences for heating, staccato fragments for ice cracks—taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice convergence test n/a. Filter verbs minimal; “he noticed” etc. appear only when they duplicate gesture already shown, forgiven by poetic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s sensory filter; rhythmic compression under pressure (“trembling certainty”) distinguishes voice without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person stays close to oracle POV with controlled psychic distance; diction (“pebble-shore,” “ambered hush,” “topology of hope deferred”) is specific and internally consistent. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for rising silence, clipped fragments for the commander’s doubt—without falling into template drumbeat. Compression and elision are taught by line two and remain legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person keeps distance appropriate to a machine POV; perceptual signature favors servos, frost patterns, diagnostic pulses over flesh metaphors. Syntax is clipped, rhythm repetitive like a maintenance log, rising to lyric swell only during the violin passage. No head-hopping; Dr. Yemeni’s dialogue stays external, observed. Micro-setting vocabulary (“gripper attachments,” “servos”) stays inside plausible machine lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: rainbows caught in glass, the unexpected weight of a circle of glass, the sudden clarity that the doodles are addressed to her. Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses when she recognizes the voice, longer sinuous lines during reflection. No head-hopping; Dmitri’s interiority is inferred only through speech and gesture, preserving distance. The final “resonant hush” line risks poetic overlay but is earned by the acoustic motif established in paragraph 1.

The perceptual signature—sound as legal testimony—carries to the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: “botanical illustrations rendered in ice,” “auroral sorrow” sit inside her lexicon.

No head-hopping; psychic’s voice is mediated through phone static, preserving POV discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is crystalline, slow, mineral: long vowels and caesuras mimic drip-time. Perceptual signature notices texture over taxonomy—“paper grown soft as fabric,” “silence pooled like water.” Compression teaches its pattern by line three and never wavers. No head-hopping; interior distance swells then dissolves with the keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual bias: she notices breathing shifts, shoulder angles, “barely perceptible” changes. Syntax mirrors her cadence—“softly adaptive,” “mellow quality”—without drifting into how-to manual. Thomas’s two spoken lines break voice open with startling metaphor, justified by three-year silence. No filter-verb bloat; guitar rests “like an old friend” is single permissible uplift, earned by prior texture.

Register never drifts into academic abstraction; carnival argot is organic.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Chen’s perceptual band—geological diction, chemical precision, tremor in palms. Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for calm setup, staccato pre-detonation. No dialogue, so voice must carry scientific melancholy alone; it does.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays lashed to Mara’s sensorium; every verb choice is tactile or acoustic. Syntax shortens under tool-work pressure (“fingertips found the microscopically damaged crystal lens”) then lengthens in coda reflection, mirroring emotional cadence.

No filter-verb stacks or head-hop, peak-beat prose clean.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is curator-precise: “luminous fruit,” “simply complicated,” “discarded possibilities.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments during epiphany—rhythmic control matches cognitive stress. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Free indirect style stays clean; perceptual signature consistent—“museum’s Renaissance collection was a forgery network” is pure Maya. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.

Tense stable; no head-hop. Prose mirrors her glass-song affinity via assonance and crystalline syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elden’s perceptual signature: she notices shadow lengths before emotional labels, speaks in archival precision (“temporal depth”), and her final silence is rendered as sensory fade. Rhythmic control tightens under pressure—short percussive clauses during the loop discovery, then elongated cadence as she liquefies into memory. No head-hopping; the archive’s whispered question is still filtered through her auditory hallucination. The diction never drifts into faux-antiquarian purple; it stays scient yet numinous, matching the speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Kael’s perceptual filter—sound of chant, weight of knot, light on mosaics. Rhythm mimics fuse-count: “Three beats rise…” repetition teaches the pattern and pays off when laughter breaks the count. No head-hop; the woman’s interior is only guessed. Compressed syntax under spin-motion heightens immediacy; occasional elevated diction (“serious playfulness”) is diegetic, uttered by character, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lingers inside Chen’s perceptual signature—counts water levels, hears gull-equivalent silence—without leaking into Mira’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marco’s perceptual signature—decibel readouts, crystal lattice geometry, passenger breathing—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and softens under hush, mirroring glide path: “letting momentum carry them… barely moving.” Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, idiomatically Italian-tinged (“Watch the vial”) without caricature. Only micro distance shift: final line widens to mythic promise, justified by accrued lyric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Cassian with perceptual signature—“amber light filtered,” “vanilla and dust”—syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at mechanical contact. No head-hop. Filter verbs serve voice (“he understood this was what he’d come for”) rather than dull immediacy. Dialogue is absent, so bullets there are waived. Minor register wobble: “standing waves that only proper equipment reveals” edges academic, but fits an ex-engineer’s self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice carries lyrical, slightly archaic cadence suited to a knight recalling canticles, but diction stays within plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature strong—he notices metallic harmonics in fruit, counts armor pieces, feels paper warmth. No dialogue to contaminate texture; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. One minor register wobble: “printer’s press” feels modern against otherwise timeless idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited sustains consistent distance; perceptual signature is archival—Miriam “catalogues dust,” “cross-references grief.” Syntax grows slightly choppier under pressure (“She couldn’t reunite…But she could ensure…”) mirroring internal acceleration.

Diction stays inside her plausible lexicon: “obsolete film camera,” “cognitive dissonance” feel like words a clandestine archivist would use.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric, pattern-taught compression (“the condensation forming on stone…”) sustains a jazz-solo rhythm, while perceptual signature—“each droplet catching the first pale light”—remains idiosyncratically Marcus’s; no head-hopping; elision is paid off when the final breath literally shapes the absence of echo.

Psychic distance stays shallow and consistent; inference reads as inference (“seemed suddenly purposeful”). Tense and stance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual filter: “luminous regret,” “stomach clench,” “weight of names” are her diction, not author intrusion.

Filter verbs appear only when they mirror her psychometry procedure, hence motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)

The compression “universe fall upward” is taught by earlier pattern of inverted falling, legitimizing the fragmentary grammar at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mara’s perceptual signature—“angle of a broken frame suggesting violence”—no head-hop. Diction is controlled, arid, beekeeper-precise; no register drift. Syntax breathes with emotional beats: short clauses at ghost dispersal, longer reflective cadences earlier. Minor slip: one near-algorithmic string “then the drought came, and they’d fled, and the bees had died”—template cadence costs the 0.1 that keeps it from 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a cool, elegiac distance that matches Mira’s archival temperament; diction stays within her plausible lexicon while rhythmic variation heightens the final stargazing beat, and no filter-verb clusters dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)

Diction stays within her lexicon: “mycorrhizal,” “fruiting bodies” are terms she’d inherit from the diary. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The final compression into a single exhalation satisfies poetic closure without syntactic monotony. A hair more idiosyncratic speech in her diary addendum would perfect it.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering description through Elara’s scientist-poet synapses: “wet stone and new leaves” collapses geology and botany into felt sense.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—“stone ear,” “luminous absence”—diction precise yet unshowy. Rhythm mirrors her pacing: long sentences for circling the gallery, abrupt fragments when the riots intrude.

Voice never lectures; even abstract notions like “nomadic penumbra” arrive via sensory metonymy.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-ornate but disciplined: cadenced parallelism (“This too was a kind of vision. / This too was a kind of truth.”) mirrors mercury’s ripple. Diction stays within seer’s mythic lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is distinct—she reads steam, shadows, feather ridges—and holds to the last refraction.

    Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s sensory bandwidth—sulfur, grinding gears, limestone grit under gloves—without POV leakage. Diction (“quilting together memories,” “luminous scar”) belongs to an alchemical lexicon salted by urgency; rhythm shortens under oxygen debt, then elongates during the golden bloom. No dialogue present; therefore dialogue bullets ignored.

No head-hop; Mira’s interior is guessed at through voice-softening and shadow. Diction stays within alchemist lexicon: “columella,” “refractive indices,” “ontological weight.” Rhythm accelerates during drip-sequence, then breathes out in the palm-transfer beat. Filter verbs serve voice: “she saw how she’d etched” = scientist cataloguing her own trace.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: temporal displacement rendered as synesthetic soup, ink made from future YouTube, gravity obeyed only in dreams.

No head-hopping; diction remains within cartographic lexicon. The final quiet sentence mirrors the opening cadence, proving rhythmic control. One hairline slip: “therapy-speak” echo in “she understood now why…” is mild enough to leave 9-band intact.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is controlled and slightly technical—nouns like “substrate connections” and “frequency” mirror her professional lexis without jargon overload.

Psychic distance contracts in real time: from bureaucratic remove to finger-wet intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays tightly lashed to Maren’s perceptual filter: “walnut-ink archivist,” “specific sepia,” “haunted-euphoric smile” are her idiom, not authorial flourish.

No head-hopping; collective “we” in quoted line is spoken, not narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “ivy that crept…like nature reclaiming its due” is her professional metaphor for forgotten zones. Syntax is controlled and varied—“polite anarchy of people who’d learned that mutual aid began with aiding each other” lands as compressed credo. Dialogue is minimal but distinctive: Emil’s first line jolts with conspiratorial idiom; Mara’s reply stays terse, logistical. No head-hopping; when others arrive they remain external, preserving her focal center.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is synesthetic and photographic—“framing the luminous scene,” “visual waveforms bloom like flowers”—consistent with Marina’s eye-trained silence. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for moonlit calm, staccato clauses when program blooms. No head-hopping; POV stays inside Marina’s visual cognition. Dialogue is delivered via clean italicized signed lines that read like urgent subtitles, preserving immediacy. Diction stays within her lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—“analytically intuitive” diction, volcanic tenderness rhythm, ochre-noticing eye. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; even “she thought” carries archaeologist precision. No head-hop, no register drift; academic Latinate nouns feel like tools she actually wields. At 8.8 because a single clause (“dementia claimed her completely”) flirts with diagnostic label-speak, though it is instantly grounded in the grip-ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays pinned to Theo’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Percussive syntax—clusters of short, stressed clauses—mirrors his nervous habit; register never drifts academic. Lagoon reflections and ribbon-light metaphors remain within speculative lexicon taught early. Dialogue sparse but indirection-rich: “Stop it” / “You’re the one who taught me” carries subtext of causality confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is auditory—he “identifies people by their walks,” hears “hydraulic groans” as cues. Syntax tightens under pressure: “He didn’t panic. He’d learned that whispers travel farther…” mirrors the calm he preaches. Woman’s dialogue is spare, technician-terse, distinct from Marcus’s reflective cadence. No head-hopping; every metaphor (“steel canyons,” “poisonous green”) is filtered through his sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Free-indirect third stays close to Marina; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is optically precise: bruised light, angled reflections, star symbolism—mirrors dominate metaphor bank. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during signal flares—rhythm modulates with pressure. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within educated working-class lexicon. Final para’s drum-beat “Tomorrow…” is intentional cadence, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Miss Chen’s perceptual filter: she hears footsteps as semantic data and sees “predictable geometry” outside. Syntax elongates in reflective beats, then shortens when she pitches the plan, mirroring persuasive urgency. Filter verbs (“she thought”) are minimal; metaphors stay within her pedagogical register. Distinctive cadence in “amplified quiet is louder than shouting” reads like her private aphorism, not authorial appliqué.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient hovers just above Mira, dipping into her calloused sensorium: “salt-bitter morning” aligns with dock-worker bias. Syntax glides between lyrical compression and muscular verb choice, mirroring dance/labor duality. No head-hop; Kael’s interior accessed only through Mira’s reading of his face and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is precise—megawatt counts, theatrical diction—mirroring his coping mechanism. Rhythm modulates: long performative sentences collapse into the whispered “I am watching my daughter feel again.” Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext; Emma’s two spoken lines fracture the mask without ventriloquizing her interior. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly bound to Meris’s sensorium; perceptual signature is poet-specific (lantern-moth simile, synesthetic “blue shadows humming”). Syntax modulates: longer cadences for reverence, clipped fragments during pillar tremor. No head-hopping; Kael’s dialogue is externally observed. Diction (“verse-shadows,” “quantum states of meaning”) stretches but remains within poet-POV lexicon. Rhythm control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Maya’s perceptual world: values over hues, textures over tints. Sentence rhythm flexes with pressure—short bursts during ember scatter, longer lyrical coils when mixing paint. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but distinct (Tomás’s whispered “I can’t wake up”). The bent-reed motif returns as tactile refrain, teaching the pattern early and paying off in final gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—only her spine’s chimes and her interpretations of volunteers’ reactions are given. Syntax mirrors her measured gentleness: long vowel clusters, soft consonants, deliberate cadence. No dialogue until the final three spoken lines, each carrying subtext of invitation rather than explanation. Voice control under pressure: the climactic playback is rendered in short sensory clauses that mimic stroboscopic light, then relax into the longer final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “fingers blackened,” “telescope became her confessional.” Syntax mirrors craft precision: short clauses for jewelry work, longer lyrical sweeps for star-gazing. No head-hop; Senna’s interior is read through Mara’s watching. Register remains within Mara’s artisan lexicon—“oxidized copper,” “tattoo stencil on vellum”—never drifts to academic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Vesper’s perceptual filter: “scattered diamonds” for raindrops, “sleeping snake” for tape—metaphors rooted in her symbolic toolkit. Free indirect style is clean: “She too had camouflaged her research” carries judgment without filter verbs. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Marcus’s corporate diction (“continue her work”) contrasts Vesper’s cartomancer cadences (“multiply paths”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally under all-night pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains a historian’s erudite lexicon (“distilled emotional and intellectual core,” “sublimation over survival”) yet stays within a plausible scholar’s register. Perceptual signature is minute: she notices geometry, unnamed colors, and archival mechanics rather than generic awe. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; rhythm swells and contracts with crystal sequences, mirroring absorption trauma. The lyric compression is taught early—“colors that had no names”—and paid off in the final refusal sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Sera’s perceptual filter; diction skews lyrical but consistent with a curator who names dream-glass and focus-grouped petals. Rhythm modulates: longer clause-chains for archival awe, clipped fragments at the insight beat (“It was saturated”). No head-hopping or register drift. The voice is not strikingly idiosyncratic, yet it sustains a coherent atmospheric texture that supports the concept without crowding it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s perceptual filter—notice asymmetry of “one eye rotating independently” and tactile focus on “leather cover worn soft.” Syntax mirrors her slowed-time vigil: long sentences breathe during observation, then compress at the keystroke moment. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within a field-biologist’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Celeste’s perceptual filter: “dust motes swirled through shafts… she could still sense” etc. Psychometric visions are cleanly signaled as interior access, not head-hop. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for an itinerant seer; no sudden academic register. Rhythm modulates—long breath while reading, then clipped as she pries the box—mirroring pressure without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with patterned compression (“voice like wind through empty cathedrals”) taught early; perceptual signature remains consistent, no head-hop, free indirect style stays clean, rhythm modulates under aurora intensity—minor loop near “falling stars traced paths” keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is sustained lyric-fugue: long vowel chains, fractured lullaby cadence, scientific diction (“superposition,” “wave functions”) melted into incantation. Perceptual signature—quantum gardener who hears seed frequencies—remains unique and consistent. No dialogue, so voice convergence test is waived. Patterned elision (“occasionally everywhere”) is taught early and paid off at closure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person voice is steady, lyric-philosophic, and syntactically varied; diction stays within the thinker’s register (“epistemology,” “mandala”) without ballooning. Perceptual signature is strong—wind harmonics read differently to him than to others—so head-count and POV control remain flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric bears distinct salt-air cadence, syntactic parallelism (“smooth and salt-silvered,” “gentle and persistent”) that teaches its incantatory pattern early. Perceptual signature is tactile/auditory rather than visual, suiting a character who anchors by feel. Register stays within Mara's plausible lexicon; no滤镜-verb bloat. Dialogue minimal, appropriately oracular; no convergence under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is crisp: tactile military cataloguing (discoloration, sheared metal, wobble) meets lyrical winter metaphors without ever departing from Rielle’s sensorium. Compression is taught early—“snow that never stopped falling” signals patterned diction; payoff is the final cadence “snow continued its eternal descent.” No head-hopping; Silent-Choir’s interior is implied solely through gesture, maintaining distance control. Rhythm flexes from sinuous long sentences (ascent) to staccato clauses under piano chord pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays locked to Ossian’s poetic-archivist register: diction of“constellation-leather,”“rune of drift,”and measured cadence. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for timelessness, clipped“he dissolved… he composed” for action beats. No head-hopping; mortal-world glimpses remain external, filtered through Ossian’s intent. Free indirect style is clean(“he understood immediately”). Micro-texture could be even more idiosyncratic for 9+, but voice is consistent, purposeful, and musical.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual bias—she notices temperature decimals, ignores crew faces; diction is scientist-lean but not jargon-drunk; rhythmic repetition of tapping and “remembered” creates accumulative cadence; no head-hopping or register drift; dialogue snippet is utilitarian but voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyrical, perceptual signature sharp: “toes curled against cold metal grating,” “vintage opera glasses pressed to her eyes.” Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences slow to match dusk, then tighten at hum’s climax. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within Kess’s reach; no corporate register drift. Voice feels singular and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays welded to Naja’s perceptual signature—mineral taste, root-voices, pruned fingers. Syntax breathes with geothermal steam: long pools of clauses under low urgency, then tight verb bursts at dissolution. No head-hop; kite-script diction stays archaic without authorial intrusion. One clause drifts toward editorial summary: “she would ensure…” which slightly lifts the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is botanically exact: “economical and precise” movements, “salt-kissed air,” “shears suspended above a stem.” Syntax is calm, rhythmic, mirroring the pearl-layering process; no drumbeat patterns. Compression in “hope like jewelry” and “sky had opened with fire” teaches lyric density early and pays off in the final bloom line. No dialogue, so voice stays single, coherent, and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice carries painterly perceptual signature—“geometric shards,” “ink and prophecy,” “salt-crusted windows”—distinctive, rhythmic, compressed. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments and em-dashes mirror collapsing space. No head-hopping; lyrical elision taught early (“reality itself had cracked”) and paid off in final flare. Within striking distance of 9+ but for a single over-explicit rhetorical question mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays tightly chained to Kael’s predator sensorium; drone’s metallic whir, ink’s wet mineral smell, sandstone’s dust on tongue. Syntax lengthens during the spiral gaze, compressing again when he speaks into comm—rhythmic mimicry of stretch/contract. No head-hop; Vera’s interior is inferred only through Kael’s reading of her stillness. One register slip: “temporal perception during crisis moments” sounds white-paper; swap for Kael’s lived idiom to touch 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is scientist-archivist: “cataloging contraband,” “cryogenic cradles,” “thermal stress.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments during override beats (“Not yet. But she would wake one.”). Diction stays within her lexicon; “crystalline stairs” reads as her trained eye, not authorial purple.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: roses “catching amber light,” sand “sifting from coat,” blade “sliding home” echo the same granular texture. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences for Mira, clipped fragments for Kael. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she caught the scent”) not intrusive. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly with Mira until Kael’s single exterior gesture closes the story.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is character-specific: astronomical diction (“proper ellipse,” “stellar coordinates”) married to newspaper argot (“circulation numbers”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for reflection, staccato scratch of nib for action. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact (“she sometimes forgot” not “she must have forgotten”).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close stays anchored to Vera’s acoustician perceptual lens: “crack of ice on a frozen lake” is heard, not seen. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She wasn’t debugging…she was rewriting”—mirroring code logic. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register disciplined: no corporate diction, no filter-verb fog.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate carries a consistent lyric compression: “memories flaking like old paint” is perception-filtered, not ornamental. Psychic distance modulates—wide at grotto mouth, tight at chalk tip—under emotional intensity. No head-hopping; crowd breathes as one instrument. Filter verbs serve voice (“she could sense the shape”) and stay legible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through tactical attention—cracks, pigments, thermal memory in metal. Syntax flexes under pressure: short paratactic clauses when she rips free of vision, longer sinuous lines inside the memory loop, mirroring temporal suction. Diction stays concrete and Near-Eastern (tessera, minaret) without exoticist flourish. One微型 slippage: “warm coldness” is named but not embodied in voice texture; still, rhythm control is confident and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice owns lyric compression: “sound bloomed as color,” “twilight meant little”—pattern-taught ellipsis mirrors her fractured clock. Perceptual signature consistent: every noun filtered through chromatic taste/tone. Rhythm swells then disperses, matching dance arcs. No head-hopping; single spectral POV maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV remains stable close-third; perceptual signature skewed to thermo-tactile data, scientific diction (“gradients,” “grotto”) filtered through poetic cadence. Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under sensory overload, mirroring psychic porousness. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Free indirect style clean: “tense became meaningless” stays within her ken.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Narrative distance stays tight third; no head-hopping. Voice carries cataloguer precision—“severed from its original purpose,” “shared wisdom written in fragments”—that mirrors Mara’s vocational eye. Syntax lengthens slightly under reflection, then compresses into present-tense urgency at “she took the canyon echo jar,” tracking emotional surge. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no head-hop. Vocals like “silver hush,” “prudently daring,” and frost-slick syntax create a consistent lyric tension that modulates into propulsive short sentences once decision hits. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Emma’s “Show me” is goal-driven, not declarative. Free indirect style is clean: “he understood now” slides seamlessly from narration to interior.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close to coachman maintains perceptual signature: weather-craft metaphors, auditory bias, spindrift diction. No head-hop; woman’s interior accessed only through her external voice and his inference. Syntax modulates: short clicks for horses mirror quiet authority; longer reflective sentences when he relinquishes silence. Dialogue minimal, subtextual (“until the rain gutters stop ticking”). Free indirect clean; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to potter’s perceptual signature—sun angles, clay tactility, wheel-thrum vocabulary. Syntax mirrors her slow-wheel rhythm: longer sentences for meditation, fragments when glass visions fracture. No dialogue to test character distinction; internal diction stays within artisan lexicon. Patterned elision (“then flickered, then solidified”) is taught early and paid off at closure; zero head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s locksmith-trained perception: she “measures” light angles, “recognizes” gauge depths, hears harbor “rhythm of oars.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during climb—“She watered it carefully, then adjusted the mirror”—mirroring effort. No head-hopping; diction remains within her taciturn, tool-fluent lexicon. Distinctive, consistent, and modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder, rarely wider than her animal/human sensorium: “hollow ache of being the final one” is phrased like instinct, not analysis. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then compresses during tactile beats—matching respiratory cadence of pacing tiger versus cataloging clerk. No filter-verb clutter; perception is immediate. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she can name “gnomon” because she’s been studying sundials. Rhythm control at closure: short declarative—“She was the first of something new”—delivers the charge without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Margot’s perceptual filter: she notices grammar of desire, syntax of hope—idiosyncratic, writerly. Syntax grows more paratactic under emotional pressure (“She tied her letter…watching it find its place”) mirroring the spiral’s accretive logic. No head-hopping; Sena’s dialogue is external data, not interior access. One clause drifts toward editorial omniscience—“inevitably whimsical in its vagueness”—but quickly re-centers.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s perceptual signature—subsonic frequencies felt in dental work, vision “blur at the edges”—is idiosyncratic and consistent. Syntax stays concise, with purposeful repetition (“always slightly off-camera, always just beyond proof”) that mimics radio static. No dialogue, so no head-hopping; POV distance remains tight-third with no filter-verb bloat. Lexicon stays within a STEM-savvy night owl’s range; “celestial frequencies,” “ionosphere,” and “mathematical proof” feel earned, not showing off.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person focalization stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature is selective—she notices stone breath, silver compass, starlight geometry, all filtered through claustrophobic prioritization. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences when fear ebbs, clipped fragments during wall-choke. No head-hopping; organ remains external phenomenon. Diction stays within explorer lexicon—vellum, channel, shaft—no corporate intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays inside Elena’s perceptual limits: faces blur, voices carry identity. Syntax grows clipped under quarry pressure—“methodical, measured”—then widens during interviews to mirror accumulating voices. No dialogue on page, so voice contamination risk avoided. Diction remains within Elena’s artistic lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays snugly inside Mira’s perceptual filter: archaic notation, maritime maps, jet-stream physics—all voiced in her diction. No head-hop; Kao’s interior is implied only through gesture. Rhythm modulates: longer, clause-stacked sentences when decoding, then staccato “Coming?” under adrenaline. Only minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels like rubric intrusion, not Mira’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited adheres to Mara’s perceptual grammar; “pixelated,” “wet-plate collodion,” “bridge-song fiddler” diction is hers, not authorial glossary. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during observation, staccato fragments (“Pixelated amnesty.”) mirror musical beats. No head-hop; scaffold-wrap morse is external data she decodes, keeping knowledge bounded. One clause drifts toward editorial certainty: “she understood,” but immediate musical translation converts tell to dramatized proof, softening the lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Marco’s ranger-trained perception: motion sensors “disguised as birdhouses,” dusk has “a quality he had learned to cherish.” Syntax mirrors calm: longer sentences for cataloguing, then clipped fragments when father appears. No dialogue until final beat; when it arrives, diction differentiates generations (“I wondered if you’d come back here” vs “I wanted to understand”). Free indirect style is clean: “He’d marked the territory carefully” could be narrator or Marco’s self-assessment. No head-hopping, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is astronomically tilted: hearts "settle in chest" like calibration weights, tea steam "rises and falls" like Cepheid curves. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for dream recollection, short Anglo-Saxon bursts under star-matching pressure. One voice slip—Elias says "transformation through darkness" in Mara’s diction—prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s soldier-druid perception: “wind screaming through skeletal branches” is heard as enemy, not spectacle. Syntax lengthens then chops to mimic spiral tightening; diction stays iron-in-moss plain, never drifts to mage-cant. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy in “she planted her staff and began to sing.” Final sentence’s blade metaphor sheathes the voice in its own metallic cadence—rhythmic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person omniscient lite stays consistently anchored in Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinct texture—“root-bound,” “cobalt glade,” “recursive patterns”—creates lyric signature. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences collapse into short, syncopated fragments at the link beat, mirroring pulse. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” sounds like craft-talk, not Mira’s idiom, but occurs only once and does not contaminate dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush yet controlled; consonant clusters (“catacomb orchard,” “ribcages of saints”) create a moth-wing flutter without purple drift. Perceptual signature is Oracle-bound: heat on thigh, glow grading into corridor, fierce-gentle modulation under pressure. No head-hop; Marcus observed from outside keeps distance clean. Syntax shortens at peak—“Will it hurt? Yes.”—showing rhythmic command.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-close focalization maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is audiophile-tinged (“feedback loops,” “soldering cable”). Free indirect slides cleanly into “confidently uncertain” coinage without register drift. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional cadence—long reflective sentences broken by tactile micro-beats. No dialogue contamination; Sarah’s terse legalese contrasts Marcus’s interior sonics. Patterned elision (absent crowd, absent stage) taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close focalization stays locked to Maris with lyric compression (“serenity of winter sunlight filtering through ice”) that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final moonlit hush. Diction remains within a former-fisher’s lexicon; no academic register intrudes. Syntax modulates from long tidal sentences to short forge beats, mirroring task rhythm. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“I’ll return it tomorrow” laughed away) without ventriloquizing the narrator. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close maintains inspector’s calibrated diction—”faceted walls,” “ventilation systems,” “nacre”—then frays into reverent syntax as wonder overtakes him. Rhythm modulates: clipped inspection beats yield to longer, incantatory sentences mirroring spiral text. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Marcus’s professional filter. Pearl glow and cave response are perceived through his body, not explained.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. Figurative control tight—“constellations of light,” “crown of thorns”—mixed only once (“heartbeat of hesitation” slightly clashes with geological silence). No scaffold, loops, or register drift; technical terms accurate. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via living image. Minor −0.1 for near-simultaneity in “lifted the pearl carefully. Beneath it lay…” (sequential but reads stacked).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person hovers at a calibrated distance, filtering perception through veiled dreamer’s selective attention (“tasted of cardamom and forgotten names”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock (“She opened it carefully.”). No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythm; occasional adjective drift (“ethereal,”“impossible geometry”) edges toward purple but stays in character. Consistent perceptual signature; compression and reversal pattern taught early and honored.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical, synesthetic diction stays anchored to Elena’s researcher precision—“perforated destiny, punched through with holes” marries artifact description to emotional insight. Patterned repetition (plant whispers, coffee rings) is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping; rhythm tightens under dawn deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-scientific: “threshold of stillness,” “lucidly watchful,” solar-wind vocabulary all filtered through a woman who has memorized thermals and grief. Syntax flexes—long breathless clauses for aurora swells, staccato fragments for tool movements—yet stays legible. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. One microscopic filter-verb hiccup: “She had learned long ago…” could compress to “She learned…” but does not contaminate peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays tightly filtered through Keiko’s perceptual quirks—clouds “forming and reforming, never the same shape twice.” Syntax mirrors her recursive doubt via comma-joined ruminations that breathe but never bog. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: the woman’s vineyard hush versus Keiko’s clipped admissions. No head-hop; distance modulates only with the final zoom onto the heartbeat-like phoenix.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature—“hollow mirror shard,” “cloak of doubt,” “sincerely insincere greeting”—is idiosyncratic and consistent. Keeper’s dialogue carries subtext: “Most people wait…” offers ritual, not advice. Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments when she climbs, longer breaths when she listens. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent autumnal hush; syntax elongates in trance passage, then contracts at descent, mirroring altered time sense.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Diction—“harmonic stone skimmer,” “standing waves,” “recursive geometries”—is precise yet within his hereditary lexicon. Rhythm swells with longer sentences during harmonic listening, then tightens at the turn: “He tucked the arrowhead… turned.” No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate. Voice distinctiveness is the perceptual signature itself—sound as sediment, time as pattern—sustained without varietal monotony. Elision taught early (sound=stone) and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: “she wondered,” “had come to think”—no knowledge leaks. Distinct diction—“brilliant dimness,” “sacred simplicity,” “lingering luminance”—creates lyrical, slightly elevated register consistent with a mage experiencing wonder. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for climb, clipped fragments during fatigue (“And again.”). No dialogue, so voice distinction within cast is N/A; internal voice stays coherent. Filter verbs are few and motivated, maintaining immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited remains tightly glued to Mara’s sensory sieve: cold shocks, match flares, algae pulses. Rhythm mirrors lamplighter gait—steady, then staccato when she swims. Diction stays within her maritime vernacular: “breach,” “mud angle,” “meteor hush.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional lyric lift (“delayed stars,” “infinite dark score”) is earned by her grandfather-trained synesthesia, not authorial ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; no head-hopping. Diction—“stellar doubt,” “death rattle,” “wavelength aligning”—creates a consistent cosmological register without crowding. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into clipped “Teach me,” mirroring universe’s compression. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven, carries subtext of desperation vs. belief. Perceptual signature strong: Mira notices light frequency, coin wear, static timbre—professional astronomer’s bias rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual bias: she notices light fractures, brass echoes, paper texture under fingertips. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, then fragments at the crystallize moment—“So she had kissed him”—mimicking staccato decision. No dialogue, so voice purity is sustained. Occasional Latinate loft (“transform the vast terror of emptiness”) drifts above her plausible lexicon, but the lapse is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Emris’s perceptual quirks—he counts drips, notices barnacle-letter shifts, calibrates heat by “just enough.” Syntax mirrors his methodical mind: measured clauses, iterative “he could” constructions that pay off when the cadence breaks at the bell-strike. No POV leakage; diction never exceeds his clerk-adjacent lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter—“water-stained but recognizable,” “garish blue sign he’d hated”—diction precise to a man who notices decay and color for a living.  Rhythm modulates: long accordion sentence for town history, clipped fragments when he stoops to photographs.  No head-hopping; Eleanor’s interior is only what Marcus can guess.  Final chime sentence is shortest, letting sound itself complete arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinctive: “water that tasted of first mornings and forgotten centuries” is a mind that measures time chemically. Syntax mirrors alchemical process—long, compound sentences for synthesis; fragments when the crystal is seized. No dialogue, so voice modulation happens through rhythmic compression under pressure: “Into her crucible went…” becomes an incantation. The narration never exceeds Lyra’s lexicon; even “calligraphy” fits her habit of seeing patterns in skies and formulae.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Vera’s perceptual filter—bioluminescent “blue-white lightning,” metal edge “bit.” Rhythm compresses under radio tension, then widens during arboreal description, mirroring vigilance cycles. Diction remains within scientist-observer lexicon; no register drift. No dialogue contamination; speech sparse, natural. No head-hopping; distance stable. Elisions (previous observer’s fate) taught early and paid off in her refusal to repeat collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical-scientific: “probability streams,” “quantum foam,” yet filtered through post-ego detachment that justifies the lexicon. Rhythm modulates—short staccato admissions (“Not experiment—vivify”) versus long reflective sentences showing drift. No head-hopping; both Kiras’ interiority is separated by paragraph breaks. Distinction is achieved through stance, not dialect, fulfilling sci-fi elevation without artificial gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Margot’s perceptual filter—botanical database, pattern hunger, brook’s murmur. Prose texture varies: longer lyrical cadence at opening, compressed diction at climax—“She dropped the seed.” No dialogue, so voice modulation shows through syntax shift under pressure. Distinct idiom in “orthogonal approaches” and “nocturnal haven” fits puzzle-designer intellect without drifting into jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person intimate stays close to Martin’s perceptual filter: sound-doubling, dust galaxies, engine wheeze. Diction is grief-numb, avoiding decorative flourish; syntax lengthens during conducting, contracts when motor dies. Dialogue minimal, natural, subtext-heavy (“Show me”). No head-hopping; Sarah’s interior is implied only through audible breath and laughter. Voice modulates with acoustic pressure, not emotional declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustained without filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is tactile-ominous (“breathing wool,” “cold enough to burn”). Syntax grows clipped under pressure—final sentence a six-word waiting smile. Diction stays within beast-scholar hybrid: “Codex of Unwritten Hours” beside “coarse fur.” No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely through narrative modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is alchemist-specific: mercury, sulfur, moonstone, bone ash—lexicon stays inside craft. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for obsessive accumulation, staccato fragments (“The paste began to glow.”) for the turn. Perceptual signature is strong: she tastes disappointment, traces fracture lines like destiny. One tiny register drift: “creative destruction” edges academic, but the phrase is immediately enfleshed by the growing wood, so the voice recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-close lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—celestial technician’s diction of frequencies, arrays, perigee—without filter-verb bloat; compression (“serenely electric energy”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the shard’s pulse, legitimizing the stylized cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited clings to Mateo’s calibrated perception—starlight “at impossible angles,” brass warm under polish—creating a distinct nautical-uncanny texture. Syntax stays crisp under pressure: “The ferry shuddered, solidified, then seemed to exist in multiple states simultaneously.” Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Torres’ gravelly brevity versus Mateo’s buoyant certainty. No POV leakage or filter-verb bloat; rhythmic control heightens the merge beat without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Marina’s perceptual filter—she recognizes “frequency of human consciousness” in the thread’s pulse—and rhythmic syntax mimics the weaving motion; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter, and the elevated diction fits a designer who thinks in geometries.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited adheres tightly to Carta’s maritime lexicon: “celestial navigation,” “pressure locks,” “anchor,” never ventriloquizing alien idiom beyond her comprehension. Perceptual signature—reading terrain as azimuth versus boundary—remains consistent; she notices geometry where aliens see memory. Rhythm accelerates into short, breath-held clauses at trench edge, mirroring awe. Dialogue minimal, functional; alien speech filtered through translation necessary to her POV. No head-hop; Current-Through-Stones’s interior stays opaque as required. Distinct syntax—“light remembers its origin”—is Carta’s paraphrase of alien concept, keeping voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrative distance stays tight in Mira’s technician lens: “electromagnetic signatures of emotional resonance” is precise, not decorative. Rhythm modulates—long, liquid twilight sentences collapse into staccato tablet taps. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is direct (“fronds casting spiderweb shadows”). Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual: Lily’s whisper “I heard her…” carries shame and relief in three words. Voice never lapses into generic spooky-poetic; it remains forensic, which sharpens the ghostly effect.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is marine-science precise yet lyric: “compression in her chest,” “information ghosts.” Perceptual signature is tactile—gloved finger on warm gold, degraded rubber—never tourist-catalog. Compression taught early (“crashed hush” = patterned) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; internal distance stays tight to Mara. Diction stays within her lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm rises/falls with tide, climax in staccato camera clicks.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—mathematical counting, fractal seeing—stays consistent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Prose rhythm breathes with night-long ordeal; occasional lyrical uplift (“opal observatory gleamed”) fits contemplative mode without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person luminous close stays glued to Sarielle’s perceptual filter; diction remains mineral, somatic, wind-carved. Syntax lengthens during discovery, fragments under bodily depletion—rhythmic modulation tied to pressure. No head-hopping; canyon “echoes” stay externalized sound, not omniscient intrusion. Metaphorical register (“copper-veined hands,” “frozen scream”) is consistent with her metallurgical lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited lingers in Mira’s sensory filter: “music remembered what they had forgotten.” Syntax lengthens during the crescendo, then fractures with the violin. No head-hopping; crowd reactions remain externally observed. Distinctive cadence taught early (“impossible colours…starlight”) and paid off in golden sap. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” meta-diction is sanctioned by final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays tight to Maren’s courier-trained perception: time-stamping, spatial triangulation, risk calculus. Syntax is controlled and rhythmic (“brittle hush that settled between these warring silences”). No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior diction stays within her plausible lexicon; perceptual signature is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays tightly lashed to the carpenter’s perceptual bias—every noticed gleam or chime is filtered through his tactile creed. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath of work; no filter-verb clutter. Diction remains within a laborer’s lexicon; “misting hush,” “whispering gleam” are permissible lyric compressions taught early. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; narrative voice itself is individuated and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Cordelia’s perceptual filter: she traces equations with the scarf, notices paint-stained fingers, smells lavender. Syntax is controlled and varied—“treatises on thermodynamics rendered as sonnets” uses paraleipsis to imply breadth without catalog bloat. No head-hopping; graduate student’s whisper is reported from her awareness. Diction stays within a librarian-poet lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. The lyric lift of “analog memory more vivid than any photograph” is earned by prior object handling.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a painterly cadence (“luminous absence,” “watercolors bleeding”) consistent with Mara’s perception. No dialogue; compression and ellipses are pattern-taught and readable. Filter verbs minimal; psychic distance stays close; final shimmer moment is cleanly focalized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person focalization stays tight to Mara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is stable—she notices light, angles, symbols like a mourner scavenging for signs. Rhythm accelerates during nexus rotation via shorter declaratives, mirroring disorientation. Locksmith’s diction is deliberately plate-glass to feel forgettable, a nice risk that serves theme; voice modesty maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice carries a scientist-poet hybrid: precise diction (“luminescent spores,” “Ophiuchus”) braided with sensory lyric (“whale bones,” “autumn air”). Perceptual signature is Vera’s—she catalogs, tastes, measures—so every metaphor reads as her tool, not authorial flourish. No filter-verb bloat; syntax tightens into fragments under pressure (“Not preserved. Living.”). Distance stays steady; no experimental slippage, hence no bonus but no faults.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Narrative voice sustains hushed, elegiac rhythm with controlled syntactic variation. Archivist POV stays tight; no head-hop. Diction skews lyrical—“shard-mirror archivist,” “afternoon shadow caught in glass”—yet remains consistent with bibliophile sensibility. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Finn’s clipped insults contrast with archivist’s measured cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited coheres to Mara’s perceptual bias—she notices saplings, constellations, mist on silver hair, never tourist-catalog sights. Syntax grows shorter under stress (“She whispered to it, coaxed it”) and elongates during quiet weaving, teaching rhythmic pattern early. No head-hopping; dream-realm imagery is filtered through her orchardist vocabulary (“galleries of color” read as arboreal corridors). Diction stays rural and tactile—“weathered hands,” “sapling’s first branch”—never drifts into academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter: “familiar weight,” “particular quality of silence,” “needle singing.” Syntax is controlled, rhythm rises and falls with the knotting pace; no filter-verb bloat.

Diction remains within coastal-folk register, never drifts into purple or academic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is crisp—cartographer’s fractal eye, moisture-counting patience, synesthetic rain-as-prayer. Syntax lengthens in calm cataloguing, then tightens into fragment clusters (“There.”) under discovery. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays snug inside Maren’s beam of attention. The lyric compression (“Silence wasn’t absence; it was a language…”) is earned by prior concrete decoding work.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains disciplined psychic distance; perceptual signature is crisp and discipline-coded (“quietly analytic,” “internal liquid had achieved equilibrium”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under pressure, mirroring buoyancy. No dialogue, so voice contamination avenues are sealed. Diction stays within Elena's educated lexicon; the one elevated phrase “cathedral of loss” is earned by cumulative religious imagery and closure need.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest—knowledge limited to Moth’s perceptual field; no ghost interiority ventriloquized. Syntax mirrors her drifting-then-precise rhythm: long vapor-like clauses fracture into bolt-staccato “she pressed bolts into the wall.” Diction cloud-bound: “cumulus,” “starlight petals,” “tinkersong.” No filter-verb stacks. Head-hopping absent; electrical pulse kept external. Voice texture consistent under pressure of thunder roll.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays servant-close; perceptual signature—“polishing silver,” “blank with routine sorrow”—is distinct. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to the artist’s tactile cognition: verbs of pressure, friction, temperature. Syntax lengthens during coin-contemplation, shortens during brush-strokes, mirroring respiration. No filter-verb stacks; perceptions arrive as bodily events (“the metal’s chill crept up her metacarpals”). Voice never editorializes beyond her perceptual reach; the sky is “fractaling into infinity” because that is how pattern-sees, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature istool-and-touch obsessed, never ventriloquising cosmic lore. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for frozen grandeur, staccato “click… scrape… click” during repair. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within a craftswoman’s lexicon; only “conceptual repricing” risks a touch of academic diction but occurs post-resolution and feels like narrator summary, not POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: orchard planet light is “perpetual twilight,” chalk is “strange…simultaneously there and not there,” nebula is “cosmic cloud where new stars are born.” Syntax mirrors ghostly drift—long, comma-ward sentences that float like she does. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Joren’s brambled hope vs Elissa’s pragmatic touch. No head-hop; settlers’ voices filtered through Mara’s ear.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly attached to the adjuster’s perceptual filter—she sees “fractal repetitions,” “pane of hush,” “nested patterns”—syntax mirrors her mathematical mysticism. No head-hopping; distance stays consistent, sliding closer under stress (“hands trembling”). Prose rhythm is controlled: longer cadences for oceanic drift, short clauses for ritual steps. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction; the near-liturgical repetition of “nested patterns” reads intentional, not algorithmic. Register never drifts into exposition; every metaphor is POV-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays inside Maren’s perceptual filter—she deciphers bark-as-compass while others panic. Diction is lean, orchard-poetic (“rough as grief”) without purple drift; rhythm accelerates under bird-clicks and frost-creep. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (“Follow me”).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual lens; polymer chemist diction surfaces once (“chains formed and broke”) yet recedes appropriately. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences build to short ritual beats. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; “she realized” is justified by intellectual insight. Distinctive noticing—foam as “symphonic”—anchors voice.

    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Vera’s perceptual signature—“quantified the absence,” “you-shaped hole”—with rhythmic, glass-bright diction that modulates under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; prose itself functions as character, sustaining lyric control without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is controlled, tactile, epic-toned: “echo of a hundred years of regret,” “coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes.” Syntax lengthens for grandeur yet tightens under pressure—“He removed his gloves. This required touch.” No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is chef-chemist. Dialogue is sparse but natural; keeper’s lines carry subtext of relief. No register drift or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays tightly filtered through Mara’s musical ear—wind is “singing,” languages are “threaded.” Syntax mirrors her compositional mind: layered clauses like choral voicings. No head-hopping; farmers emerge only as voices joining the texture. The diction never drifts into academic register; “borrowed starlight” is the single lyrical reach, earned by voice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elena’s diction carries engineered precision (“neural architecture systems,” “synaptic plasticity”) yet tilts toward the lyrical under pressure (“moonlit cathedral of sandstone”).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains psychic distance; diction—“thoughtfully precise,” “difficult beauty”—stays within Kavir’s academic register. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for magnetic listening, clipped fragments for dawn deadline. No dialogue to distort voice; daughter’s single line carries subtext. Slight convergence in final exchange, but internal texture holds.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: auditory synesthesia (“silver scratch of arguments”) stays character-bound. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for cataloguing silences, staccato for clasp tremor. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts to body-level at click. Minor loop—“silence of…” repeated—dulls final third microscopically.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter—she notices irrigation shifts, arrow warmth, gravity in throat. Syntax lengthens during drift, then clips when she fires thrusters, mirroring pilot tempo. No dialogue, so voice carries solely through rhythmic description and sensory hierarchy. A single diction slip—“crystalline chandeliers” edges toward writerly flourish rather than pilot jargon—prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tight filters every detail through Mara’s professional gaze—velocity, chemical streaks, manifest codes. Syntax flexes with pressure: clipped clauses when alarms scream, longer cadences when fog “turns amber.” No head-hopping; Chen’s dialogue is utilitarian, keeping Mara’s perceptual signature dominant. Diction stays within investigator lexicon; only “hazy precision” drifts toward lyric, but the phrase is motif-taught early and reprised at closure, justifying the lift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s synesthetic perceptions; no head-hop. Voice texture is lyric yet precise—“throat of stars,” “crystalline absence”—syntax lengthens under awe, shortens when she acts (“She pulled… touched”). Diction stays within her sensory lexicon; no academic register drift. Rhythm modulates: aurora passage uses cascading clauses; hammer strike delivers a single clipped sentence. No dialogue, so voice must carry subtext—achieved through color-taste cross-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is austere, geologic, sonic—“avalanchingly quiet” compresses scale and danger into adverb. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for monastery memory, staccato for note-release. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs serve voice—“watched it crease like fabric”—rather than dull immediacy. Diction stays within monk-lean lexicon; “fox-fire,” “junction” feel idiosyncratic yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited adheres to the operator’s perceptual signature—selective attention to bioluminescent veins, metallic type, warming crystal. Syntax grows clipped under press-time pressure; diction stays within mathematician-borrowed lexicon. No head-hopping; patterned elision of her original name is taught early and paid off. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is strong: colors are named as light-sources, fabrics are “sorted by aurora-light,” music is “geometric proofs of beauty.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short paratactic beats during climbs, longer reflective cadences at cottage. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: merchant’s “no charge” and shepherd’s “perhaps its purpose was to wait” both conceal gifts that shift status. Only micro-slip: “extends your brief encounters into exchanges” is slightly academic for ancient Keeper, but register recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Narrative voice is close-third scientist: precise, optic-biased, slightly chilled. Diction—“refracting pale light into countless directions”—mirrors Elena’s perceptual lens.

Voice distinct without ornamental quirks.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mira’s perceptual signature: clang tempo governs clause rhythm; colour palette narrows to forge-red and sap-amber until the azure bud breakthrough. Compression is purposeful—“between understanding and confusion” teaches the reader to accept liminal summary. No head-hop; magician’s interior is inferred only through gesture and dialogue. Diction remains within a smith’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s perceptual signature is synesthetic and compressed: “vibrations singing their history,” “taste of air molecules.” Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during inter-dimensional transit, then exhales into the stark final line. No head-hopping; Mira’s voice is filtered through static and distance, preserving Kael’s POV sovereignty. Register stays inside Kael’s sensorial lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Kael's perceptual syntax—"laughing storm herald" diction, technical filaments, storm as addressee. Rhythmic control peaks at "Light erupted...warning, welcome, remembrance, prophecy," where comma-chain mirrors beam-splitting. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Occasional elevated Latinate phrases ("temporal uncertainty," "conceptual repricing territory") drift above Kael's probable lexicon but read as ritual incantation, acceptable under lyric license.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“quiet fire,” “iridescent caution”) mirrors her wary awe. Syntax lengthens under emotional load then fractures into short beats during sway—“Mira gripped the table edge”—showing rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara; distance modulates—compressed telegraphic lists in tool paragraph, lyrical dilation during moonlit sextant moment. Diction is maintenance-worker precise (“pruning shears that cut through probability”) yet tinged with private mysticism, avoiding generic fantasy register. No head-hop, no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm breathes with task tempo: short sentences for snip-extractions, longer ones for philosophical drift under storm. Voice specificity is high; slight repetition of “dream”-root nouns softens perfect 9 but keeps strong 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric POV remains stable, focalization filtered through Elora’s sensorium—“hum of memories that didn’t belong to her.” Diction stays within plausible alchemical lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm swells with song, contracts with tactile verbs—“crushed them carefully”—mirroring emotional arc. Voice is distinctive, sustained, and paid off in the final communal chorus without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly focalized through Iris; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: numeric exactitude (“eleven forty-seven,” “eleven fifty-three”) and sensory filtering of fluorescent hum fit her hyper-empathic, slightly compulsive nature. Prose texture varies rhythm—long sentences for impossible library description, short beats for midnight arrival. Dialogue sparse but functional; woman’s diction carries calm-water authority distinct from Iris’s anxious precision.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s perceptual signature: she catalogs plants, notices contradictions, distrusts easy gentleness. Syntax mirrors her halt-and-start mindset—short clauses when confronting loss, longer lyrical flows when imagining growth. No head-hopping; the old woman’s interior is accessed only through external cues. The prose’s rhythmic control peaks in the final paragraph where sentence length mirrors the forward-motion of walking back into the forgetting city.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited voice carries a curator’s cool precision: “quartz hush,” “temperature-controlled case,” “spectral color” catalogued like exhibit notes. Rhythm lengthens in calms, tightens into short sensory bursts under discovery. Free indirect thought (“someone must document what remains”) stays within her professional idiom. No dialogue = no voice-clash risk; perceptual signature is consistent, if slightly academic.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Nelle’s perceptions; lens never widens to omniscience. Free-indirect “Sunrise felt very far away” carries her body-level dread. Diction—“moonshine runs,” “truce of hush”—is vernacular without caricature; Crenshaw’s soft dialect differentiates status. Rhythm matches pulse of covert trade: long breathy clauses build tension, then short declaratives under lantern glare.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s tongue and attention; no head-hop. Diction—“terrestrially cosmic,” “data streams made manifest”—is elevated yet consistent with her data-seeking lens. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for aurora reverie, clipped fragments when the needle settles. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (Kael’s first line masks lifelong shame); no voice convergence under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s perceptual filter—“charcoal-fingered,” “mnemonically gifted” diction belongs to her idiom. Rhythm swells from hesitant arrival to frantic cadence matching chalk scratches, then exhales at dawn. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. One minor tic: “auroral sorrow” is lovely but slightly writerly for the POV; it passes because the phrase is immediately grounded in refracted light she sees.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptions; perceptual signature visible in "skies the color of spoiled milk" and her tactile obsession with textual fragments.

No head-hopping; when the elderly caretaker speaks, diction stays external, filtered through Mira’s recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual bias—sound before sight, bronze temperature before cloud vista. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ascent, staccato verbs for clapper strikes. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“she heard everything humanity had lost”) they serve climax magnification. Distinct diction—“kinetic sculpture,” “color of wonder”—remains within her artisan lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marissa’s perceptual filter: “sandstorm calm,” thrift-shop sensorium of tarnished silver, neighbor voices as texture. Diction shifts register only in Mrs. Chen’s letter, appropriately archival. No head-hop; dialogue beats carry subtext (Thomas’s invisible-plumber insight). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for dawn hush, clipped fragments at mailbox reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains perceptual signature: “mathematical music her grandfather had taught her to hear.” Syntax mirrors underwater suspension—long breath-like clauses, sudden regulator-sharp fragments. No head-hop; knowledge strictly Elara-bound. Compression (“tomorrow, seventeen prisoners would walk free”) is taught pattern, paid off. Voice modulates with pressure; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly filtered through Maris’s perceptual signature—she notices gravity vectors before visual detail, feels lantern iron before color. Syntax lengthens under gravity flux (“then sideways through dimensions she couldn’t name”) and compresses during incision (“salt and memory crystallizing together”), mirroring physical pressure. No dialogue appears; omission is purposeful, preserving lyric isolation. Diction remains within coastal-worker lexicon; no academic register leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise—she maps silence the way cartographers map terrain. Syntax lengthens and breathes during folding, then compresses into fragmentary whispers, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within her artisanal lexicon; no academic drift even at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Narrative texture is lyrical but controlled; free-indirect slides (“the language of structures…”) stay within Elena’s comprehension. Perceptual signature sharp—Elena notices limestone carving wear, tea cooling, seal’s brass warmth under meteor light. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for remembered grandmother, staccato confession beats at climax. Dialogue sparse yet distinct: Mrs. Kovac’s professorial brevity versus Elena’s tentative elisions. No head-hop; single POV holds. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor vehicles are architectural and consistent. Final cadence slows to match “ancient sentence” closure, showing purposeful modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovering close to Mira sustains a ghostly, lyrical register without filter-verb clutter. “Ghostly resolve” and “charmed skeptic” surface only as lived attitude, not labels. Sentence rhythm mirrors her slow patrol—long cadences, then clipped refusal. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers close to Mei’s perceptual filter—“pearl twilight,” “calligrapher’s brush trembling”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. Syntax grows clipped when the Magistrate steps forward, mirroring her cardiac skip. No head-hopping; the brief drift into the Magistrate’s twenty-year search is cleanly cued by his spoken memory.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is precise: POV notices pressure leaks in candles, taste of ancient ice, the way starlight “borrows” shape. Rhythm accelerates with clause compression during summoning, then lengthens for the dawn promise. No filter-verb stack; diction stays within a diver’s lexicon. Ghost voice arrives as “knowing, settling into Maya’s mind like snow”—clean free indirect distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filters—numbers, tools, soil granularity—creating a crisp, unsentimental diction. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She began to dig.”) and relaxes into reflection (“Beautiful nonsense…”). No dialogue appears; therefore voice-distinction test is waived. The one register wobble—“conceptual repricing”-style phrasing in the penultimate paragraph—leans academic outside her prior lexicon, a minute artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Elara’s perceptual filter—synesthetic storm imagery and radio bleeds feel idiosyncratic. Free-indirect diction (“Prophet rising,” “lyrically prophetic fragments”) justifies its own cadence; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical, patterned diction taught early—“wind through dunes made music against broken glass”—and held. Perceptual signature consistent: Cosima sees corrosion yet senses tenderness. Rhythm modulates: long feverish sentences for jar-ritual, short clauses at box repair climax. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person POV remains tightly interior to Meris; no head-hops. Perceptual signature is engineer-auditory: she measures wavelengths, calibrates forks, feels harmonics in glove-fabric. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“she climbed…three at a time”—mirroring tempo of ticking light. Crane’s idiom is weathered-maritime, distinct from her precise technical lexis; differentiation holds under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Ren’s perceptual grammar: angles, refraction, magnetic variance. Syntax lengthens during data-taking (“atmospheric conditions bent its light differently after rain”), then contracts at dawn (“She touched the basalt”). No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. No head-hop; every perception is instrument-filtered and cold-calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elena; no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature is investigator-cold: “cataloging evidence,” “empirical observation,” metal corrosion read as dating code. Radio dialogue is terse, bureaucratic, distinct from interior syntax. One minor register drift—“fortified vulnerability” is interpretive rather than embodied—but the phrase occurs only once and is earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays locked to Eliana; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is artisan-sighted: “magnifying loupe,” “mainspring repairs,” “verdigris and rust”—filtered through her professional guilt. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She saw now what she’d missed before—” uses em-dash compression to mimic a lens snapping into focus. Marcus’s dialogue is sparse, priestly, and goal-driven; Eliana’s replies fragment as shame rises.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is rhythmically controlled, vocab within glider lexicon (“rusted gears,” “canvas sails”). Perceptual signature is strong: Mal sees the world as currents, trajectories, refractions. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. One template cadence cluster—“every time she recalibrated…every time she tweaked”—but it is pattern-taught and pays off in the final tightening, so the high-band gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elena; perceptual signature vivid (“ghost-light,” “mathematical residue”). Compressions like “archive…hummed” and “photons and projection” teach the lyric pattern early. No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm accelerates across shards (“At 2 AM…”) then crystallizes in short final sentences. Filter verbs rare; diction within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter: “watching ice crack and reform far below” is scientist-calm, matching her occupational detachment. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments when she lifts the shard—“light scattered across the silvered surfaces”—compressing breath-time. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is judged internally: the diction remains spare, Nordic, salted with sea-cold nouns. The final sentence’s scattering light mirrors the opening image, a taught pattern that pays off without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    Narrative voice sustains a lyric, autumnal cadence consistent with Marcus’s contemplative grief; diction favors liquid consonants and measured syntax. Perceptual signature is strong—he notices vine stress, color temperature of lanterns, Elena’s coat the shade of wine. Dialogue is sparse but rhythmically distinct from narration; Elena’s clipped lines contrast Marcus’s longer analogies. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Minor register lift in “intersubjective understanding” feels academic for his viticulturist persona, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lensed to Senna’s sensory bias—she never “sees” a clearing straight on. Diction is controlled, poetic but precise (“wind through reeds,” “moth’s wing”). Rhythm modulates: long sentences for hushed pavilion, clipped fragments during the circle pour. No head-hopping; unreliability is not attempted, so distance remains stable. Voice feels singular and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited stays locked to Margot; perceptual signature filters world through curatorial metaphors—“like a prayer,” “archivist of subtle puzzles.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated, matching her vocation. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but distinct in hesitancy vs. her inviting cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric, hushed third-person stays close to Elara’s selective attention—dust spirals, crystal hum, “rest note in a composition.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping; diction remains within a lexicon a linguist-scholar would plausibly use.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: the prophet sees futures as cassettes losing signal, feels chalk dust as comfort, hears gull-highway susurrus as potential music. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences mimic fog swirls; shortest fragments (“He wrote faster.”) under panic. No head-hop; diction stays within coastal-junkyard lexicon. Final clause “with absolute devotion” lands a quiet ecclesiastical cadence that fits his vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays strictly in Kenji’s perceptual orbit: “tremor through his feet,” “thin alpine light.” Diction—escape velocity, chronometer, orrery—within sage-tech lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during recalibration, then exhales into final short sentence: “Let it spin.” No head-hopping; distance stable. Distinctive sensory signature (sound of falling leaf) reprised at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays anchored in Maya’s perceptions—“she had learned to recognize the particular quality of light”—with no head-hop. Perceptual signature is musical: light “pulses,” silence has “texture,” scent “hymns,” creating a consistent cello-toned texture. Syntax modulates—long breathing cadence for hospice calm, staccato “trembled as they lifted” under stress—without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Mr. Chen’s “I broke it during the fight” carries subtext of surgical precision turned against himself.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mira’s perceptual filter: brass warmth, rune-etched teeth, “quietly deliberate” cadence mirrored in controlled syntax. No head-hopping. Diction is scholarly-steampunk—“orrery,” “zenith,” “luminous threads”—but stays within her lexicon. Rhythm tightens at climax: three short sentences mimic the key’s final turns. Filter verbs (“she sensed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly tied to Marianne’s medical perception and rural idiom. Prose rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences early, shorter fragments at tooth reveal. Free indirect style clean (“She’d missed the biggest deception… hadn’t she?”). No dialogue until Iris speaks; single line carries subtext and advances plot. Voice distinct from authorial overlay; perceptual signature—clinical yet yearning—persists under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Maren’s astronomer percept—she calculates angles, weighs light by hue, hears ocean as cosmic backdrop. Syntax lengthens during polishing calm, shortens when memory flare intrudes, matching emotional cadence. Figurative layer blends celestial and marine lexicons—“pearl of stillness,” “zephyr bloom”—without register drift. No dialogue present; therefore voice distinctiveness rests on diction and rhythm, both consistently achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s perceptual filter: she reads the floor “like scripture,” sees Chen “navigating,” feels pendant “warm against her collarbone.” Syntax lengthens in reverence—“server racks draped in luminous moss created corridors of green light”—then tightens into breathless fragments under surprise: “Tears came.” Dialogue carries subtext; Maya’s first words to Chen—“I didn’t make that confession for forgiveness”—simultaneously rejects and invites relationship. No head-hopping; Dr. Chen’s interior is only guessed at through Maya lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to the novelist’s perceptual filter: mathematics of growth, lantern that casts no light, current of dissolution. Syntax grows slightly fragmented under pressure (“sharp-edged and terrible—”), mirroring her narrowed cognition. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on rhythmic control and diction within her plausible lexicon. The lyric pattern (cameo, dissolve, re-form) is taught early and paid off in the final line without ever breaking POV.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited hovers just above Cassian’s skin, filtering every perception through green-stained fingers and spiral musical notation. Syntax lengthens and shortens with crank-rhythm, creating a loom-like cadence. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Diction stays within rustic tinkerer lexicon; “resonating chambers” is the lone borderline tech term but justified by the machine itself.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited sustains alchemical perceptual signature: verbs like “crystallizing,” “kindled,” “cambial” mirror her metallurgical diction. Rhythm elongates in long sentences during pattern-making, then fractures into shorter units at aurora climax, mirroring breath. No dialogue to distort; interiority stays concrete (“her own heart drum against the copper”). Compression taught early (“flash-paper would ignite at a touch”) legitimizes later ellipses. No head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person voice keeps a calm, slightly archaic cadence (“wounded season,” “temporal echoes”) that suits the mythic register without purple swell. Perceptual signature is lock-smith precise: gears “frozen mid-rotation,” springs “burst from corrosion.” Compression is purposeful—elided weeks collapse into ritual beats. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; narrative diction stays consistent and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent fractal diction—“recursive patterns,” “infinite possibility,” “crystalline shafts”—mirroring the protagonist’s perceptual mode. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences during descent to staccato listing of crystal types mid-scene, then relaxes into the final quiet. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to the weaver. The elevated register is justified by the mythic task and never drifts into corporate filler.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through wood grain, rain refraction, circus dust. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for memory, staccato for knife work. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within widowed circus artisan lexicon; final paragraph’s lyric lift is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter: “broken teeth catching on skin” is felt, not observed. Rhythm modulates—long spiral sentences during drift, staccato fragments at recognition. No head-hop; ghost’s whisper is heard through Mira’s nerve. Register remains within her lexicon; no corporate intrusion. The final line’s brevity lands as earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Lena’s perceptual hierarchy: water stains, thermal deltas, brass arc. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with engineer-precision diction—“calibrated markings,” “micro-climates”—that never drifts into technical swagger. No dialogue, so voice distinction is carried through interiority and tactile action. Compression in the dawn-draft paragraph accelerates pace without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: mechanical vocabulary (“escapement angle,” “gear ratio”) filters sensory data, distinguishing her from generic wanderer. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses during reflection, shorter fragments under crystal vibration—without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One microscopic filter-verb cluster (“she understood then that”) is absorbed without momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is sharp—twilight narrowed to “neither day nor night,” canal as “faithful emptiness.” Rhythm modulates: long reflective cadences crest into short reactive bursts (“The water began to glow.”) No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays welded to Mira’s perceptual hierarchy: salt-taste before color, fiber before word. The prose inhales when she inhales—long rhythmic sentences for fog, staccato noun phrases for knots—creating a syntactic analogue to her patience. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Academic diction (“epistemic,” “genetic memory”) is rationed to moments when she would literally think those terms, preserving voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Cael’s perceptual filter: he feels palace tremors as “quaking reverie,” hears industrial rhythms transposed into melody. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short beats at the crack—“Light spilled out”—mimicking his skipped breath. No head-hopping; Vashira’s interior is shown only through externals. Diction stays within Cael’s educated but non-technical lexicon until precise terms (neural filament) are needed for the assembly beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s perceptual signature: volcanic glass noticed as “cool and dark as forgiveness,” wind read as firefighter not tourist. Diction—“kelp-drift peace,” “grafted trees”—remains within her lexicon. No head-hopping; Elena’s interior accessed only through observable tremble and smile. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for mythic graft anecdote, clipped for radio callback.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature—oil-on-water color shift, “sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”—is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm swells and contracts with action: long clauses for patience, staccato for press sequences. No head-hop. Diction remains within plausible lexicon of scientifically-trained observer. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext without expository throat-clearing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient with controlled distance; nebula diction (“mist remembering water”) stays within poetic license. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations mirror cosmic scale, then contract to crystal-chime dialogue. No head-hopping; Keeper’s consciousness remains anchor. Dialogue minimal but distinct: mother’s diction is urgent-human, daughter’s flicker of curiosity breaks terror.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is tactile and chromatic—“limestone for its willingness to hold fine detail,” “pools of copper light.” Syntax tightens under emotional pressure: fragment “Because you’re carrying more than mine” mirrors ghostly breathlessness. No dialogue clutter; spectral lines carry subtext through indirection. Free indirect style stays clean; diction never exceeds carver’s artisanal lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric-technical: diction of “calcified finger,” “brass sphere heavy as guilt” feels natural to a clock-winder’s perception. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for winding ritual, staccato fragments during engraving. No head-hopping; single POV remains tight. Compression (“seventeen years of precise movements”) is taught early and paid off in the final pendulum release, legitimizing elision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical, controlled free-indirect prose (“velveteen gloom,” “cosmic lips”) sustains a hushed, star-salted tone without purple swell; perceptual signature filters every detail through Marta’s strategic, pattern-seeking eye. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for reflective pulls, fragments at decoding discoveries. No dialogue to test, so voice coherence judged solely on interiority, which stays precise. Compression (“thread-bleeding ink”) teaches reader to anticipate frayed evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is steady, analytic, yet lyric when describing light shards and starlit ice—matching a cartographer-poet. Perceptual signature is selective attention to fracture patterns and mineral scent.

No register drift; “predictive matrices” and “polarized light” stay within Maren’s professional lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter; diction (“thistled calm,” “ember alcove”) is specific to her patient, music-trained attention. Rhythm modulates with the broadcast’s cadence, and no filter verbs dilute immediacy; voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical, contemplative third-person remains tight to Elena’s perceptual filter: she notices cracks before gold, smells charcoal dust, feels “sharp edges softened by gilt.” Syntax lengthens with reflection, then fractures in short clauses under mask-vision, mirroring content. No dialogue, so voice distinction lives in idiosyncratic metaphor—“charcoal portrait ash scatterer”—and rhythmic return to dissolution imagery. Pattern taught early (ashes, gaps) pays off in final cadence without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is scavenger-mechanic—he values “precise, mechanical, indifferent” truth and notices flood-lines and waterproof seals. Syntax grows slightly more cadenced under emotion (“philosopher’s work…survive argument”) but never breaks voice. Karin’s dialogue is distinguishably institutional: “epidemiological data,” “treatment protocols.” No head-hopping; free indirect slips are clean. Register remains consistent; only “abrasive calm” edges toward diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent poetic compression; velvet/amber/octave motifs create rhythmic signature without monotony. Filter verbs rare, diction stays within a retired music teacher’s lexicon; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors a held chord, earning the quiet close.

High-band borderline: no slippage, but no knockout sonic or syntactic risk to push above 8.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Narrative voice is steady close-third, syntactically controlled, with perceptual signature in Mira’s involuntary candor. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens appropriately under the amber glow. Compression in the opening bridge paragraph is taught by syntax and paid off in the final cooperative planning, keeping elision legible.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.5)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara notices “six inches closer hedges” and “more greeting cards than medicine,” idiosyncratic catalogues that no other narrator would inventory. Syntax mirrors her creeping rhythm—long, tide-pull sentences that pause at commas like breaths. No head-hopping; distance stays mid-close, allowing “she realized” once without filter-verb bloat. Final cadence—“finally, gratefully alive”—modulates tone from hush to quiet benediction without voice slip.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person cold-ocean distance suits the submerged garden and the marble lungs that inhale brine. Syntax glides from scientific precision—‘hairline cracks… granite eyes’—to lyric compression—‘thread understanding through time’—without register drift.

No filter-verb clutter; psychic distance controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual biases—humidity as lung, moon as coin, saffron as warmth of remembering—creating a consistent lyric signature. Syntax lengthens and pools during daydream beats, then contracts to short declaratives at brush-lifts, mirroring inhalation/exhalation of memory. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays within the lexicon of a painter who experiences language as texture.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Celeste’s perceptual quirks—she catalogues pigments, notes hairline cracks, smells rot beneath perfume—creating a curator’s idiolect. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into imperative (“Look”) under pressure, mirroring tactical shift. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero; interior diction remains consistent with an educated guide who thinks in artifactual metaphors. Occasional loftiness (“historically oriented community”) nudges toward catalogue-speak but stays within a museum worker’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice carries Gothic-lyric texture: “silk dragging across gravel,” “wound opening” smile—diction stays controlled and atmospheric. Perceptual signature is consistent: Margot notices angles, reflections, after-glow—precise to her curse. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Rhythm is deliberate, sentence variance adequate; occasional poetic lift but not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature: nautical metaphors (“note rang clear and strange”), synesthetic blur of sound-into-map, maritime lexicon filtered through craft. Rhythm flexes with urgency—long sentences during cloud study, hammer-beat fragments (“She struck. Listened. Struck again.”) under time compression. No head-hop; Deren’s interior is rendered only as external hesitation visible to her.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: cartographic attention to whorls, increments, star-positions; lexicon of geometry and ink. Compression—“sunwashed dread,” “shadow-water”—is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final brightness that hides the fracture. Psychic distance tightens from wide horizon to hairline crack without filter-verb bloat. No dialogue, so no contamination. Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph in tandem with turtle shift, proving control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays pinned to Elena with historian’s perceptual signature—dates, pigments, archival logic. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic variation supports beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marcus’s perceptual filter: “brass had oxidized to a green patina that reminded him of everything the water had taken” is idiosyncratic, not generic. Syntax lengthens under watery resistance, then compresses when the tide turns, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; every noticed detail is profession- or grief-coded. The elevated diction (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence”) is earned by the lyrical mode taught in paragraph 1 and sustained without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person intimate stays glued to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“catalogue drawer,” “spines bloated”) is profession-specific yet lyrical. Rhythm flexes—long sentences for methodical search, short bursts for discovery. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; prose itself becomes her indexing mind, achieving textured coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mei’s sensory field: silk warmth, crease tension, amber flicker. Diction (“luminous torment,” “quantum space,” “descending while ascending”) is precise, never purple, and matches her technician-poet hybrid worldview. No dialogue, so voice cohesion is carried by syntax; the clipped, mostly paratactic sentences mirror repetitive labour. Pattern of release / return is taught early and paid off in the final sentence cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is scientifically lyric, its diction fused to Mira’s training: “probability clouds,” “magnetometer readings,” yet auroras “writhe like wedding veils catching fire.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, fragments under data pings, mirroring cooling cycles. No dialogue contamination; the single spoken line is dry, Vahedi-true. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she sees the world as waveforms and amethyst chambers, never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-close hovers at intimate distance; perceptual signature sharp—Mara notices light spectra, electromagnetic pings, micro-gestures. Diction stays technical yet wistful (“frequency of belonging”). No head-hop; pilgrim’s speech idiomatically spare. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences at twilight, clipped tech phrases when drones launch. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized with a start”) but not in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual filter: “sieved hush” is her idiom, not author thesis. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for memory, staccato for Elias’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Marina’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinctive synesthetic moment: compass “heavy… like an accusation,” utility poles in “metronomic rhythm” betray an ex-navigator’s sensory bias.
