  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (glass-artist lens: "silica and flame," "cooling slowly in its mold") and consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, wider during transit summary). However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("luminous," "drifting resonance," "scorched testament") that reads as imposed rather than character-particular, especially under the stated despair. Free indirect style is clean, but several passages (e.g., "The scorched testament had taught her…") slip into helpful-narrator exposition. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara filters the world through thermal and visual metaphors tied to her deafness. Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful compression in phrases like "noise had become impossible" and "frost flowers in the suspended cold." However, some register drift into poetic abstraction ("unshaken marvels," "rectify the imbalance of her survival") occasionally slips beyond what the POV's traumatized, isolated mindset would naturally articulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "burial meant nothing when the earth itself migrated," "pressure and memory," "dignity of soil-bound death." Distance is stable third-limited; diction remains elevated but character-consistent ("distress signals," "coordinates," "broadcast across frequencies"). Rhythm modulates—longer sentences during descent, shorter at apex action. Minor register drift: "inadvertently stubborn" and "necessary architecture" read slightly meta in peak beats, and "revitalize not light, but location" feels abstractly philosophical rather than lived-in-crisis thought.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya; psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (starlight navigation, hearing Tiber's breathing). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("gently persistent rhythm," "amplified quiet"). Dialogue at closure is goal-driven and carries subtext: Maya's declaration reframes rather than sermonizes. Minor slip: "her breath misting in the moonlit air" and "her boots soft on the needle-strewn path" are clean, but some phrases ("the weight of the moment settle between them") lean toward stock introspection without fresh perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    Register oscillates between lyric abstraction ("pilgrim of sparks," "foggy lucidity") and New Age therapy-speak ("spiritually curious," "convert grief into grace through the alchemy of acknowledgment"). "The memory had surfaced three days ago—a death in another century" withholds causally available knowledge to manufacture mystery. Diction in peak beats (e.g., "condensed compassion of ten thousand prayers," "the vault where affection never spent calcified into grief") reads as elevated catalog rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated diction and lyric register throughout ("palimpsest of temporal residue," "asymptotic paths"). POV remains stable third-person limited. However, the narrative certainty exceeds what Elias can plausibly perceive during his dissolution ("his atoms distributing...according to geometric necessity"). The prose remains distinct but uniform in texture; no modulation occurs under the supposed extreme pressure of disintegration, reducing the sense of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds steady on Elara with controlled psychic distance. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-consistent: "solemn dignity," "carrying the weight of soil and rain." Two slips harm register: "staggering grace" in the penultimate paragraph reads as authorial descriptor rather than the scavenger's embodied perception, and "genetic memory of forests and fields" in mid-story tilts toward lyric abstraction without clear anchor in Elara's practical focus. The scavenger's interiority in the final confrontation ("He understood, perhaps...") briefly softens focalization but does not constitute full head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature (synesthesia, the aurora "sang a high G-sharp that made her teeth ache") anchoring voice. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "bell jar," "mechanical ear," "spectral frequencies." No head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose texture is distinct, with vocabulary ("oscilloscope," "marrow," "crucible") fitting Mara's technical background. Under peak stress, compression remains voice-coherent ("the cells in her blood continued their mindless division"). One minor slip: "Not the dramatic shatter of glass, but the precise acoustic signature of faith departing a human heart" reads slightly over-articulated for the POV's working mode.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with consistent psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices light, color, and symbolic resonance. Prose texture is distinct but leans toward uniform lushness across beats; metaphors like "heart pressing against her ribs like a fist trying to reach through flesh" and "her fingers finding frames while the world blinked" show reach but occasional strain. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("understood," "trying to hear") are acceptable within the reflective mode. Diction remains within an articulate, literary lexicon; no head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: the glassblower filters everything through craft language ("silica required 1400 degrees," "delicate grammar of drips and cracks"). The dramatizing habit—narrating mundane tasks aloud—provides voice texture and rhythmic variance. However, diction occasionally inflates beyond the character's established register: "caesura in the long sentence of ice" and "weighty lightness...buoyant with hope" read as authorial intrusion rather than her working vocabulary. The prose maintains clarity and purpose, but the voice slips toward committee lyricism in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Kai's acrophobia colors star perception ("crushing weight"), and professional stunt-training filters structural assessment. Diction is controlled with purposeful elevation ("indifferent stars," "transformative betrayal") that fits the reflective register. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("You built me to be a perfect double..."). Deductions: the phrase "firmly adaptive survival mechanisms" reads clinical rather than in-character thought, and "hyper-awareness honed to a razor's edge" is near-cliché. The consistent use of "Kai" to refer to both protagonist and drowned child creates brief ambiguity ("the original Kai") that requires re-parsing, though context clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited POV with a distinct texture: vocabulary like "ambered," "marbled," and "viscous" reflects the oracle's professional idiom, and perceptual signature is consistent (she notices durations, frequencies, densities of silence). However, some diction feels elevated beyond plausible character lexicon ("dispersing," "methodology," "negative space") without full grounding in her seventeen-year obsession, and the prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("She believed that noise was merely a distraction") that tells rather than shows through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Seven; distance is consistent. Diction is purpose-driven, blending technical register ("quantum processors," "servos") with lyric phrasing ("captured whisper," "ladder of ascending insight"). Perceptual signature is distinct—optical sensors, titanium spine—and remains coherent under pressure. "Remarkably composed" recurs as a structural anchor. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "temporal engine" and "liminal space," which read slightly elevated for a janitor's interiority, but the voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Mara with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices "mahogany groove," "graphite scratches," and acoustic details filtered through her registrar role. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Julian's "I wasn't trying to steal" pursues exoneration, and his lines carry subtext. Distance is controlled, though some diction ("thaw mistrust with transparency," "crystallizing with each breath") drifts into elevated register during peak emotional beats, slightly outside a night registrar's plausible lexicon under stress. Syntax varies purposefully, and free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "Julian's shoulders dropped" is a gestural cliché; embodied emotion could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. The prose carries a distinct, elevated register—"calculators of fortune," "scaffolding for truths not yet strong enough to stand alone"—that feels consistent but tonally uniform across calm ritual and would-be peaks. Filter verbs ("understanding that," "watching as") dull immediacy in several lines. Perceptual signature is present (vine dresser noticing plant states, chlorophyll, thorn angles) but does not modulate under pressure; diction remains constant rather than compressing or sharpening at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady, but the prose suffers from register drift: "obliging precision," "intersection of day and night," and "invisible architecture of chronology" elevate diction beyond a sky mechanic's probable lexicon under stress. Kael's perceptual signature—mechanical focus, temporal obsession—is asserted more than enacted. Dr. Vex's brief on-page moment lacks distinct voice. The sentence "Their biological signatures, dormant yet dreaming, created a unique interference pattern when viewed through the lens of coherent light projections, showing minds that drifted across hours..." reads like encyclopedia exposition rather than focalizer perception.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: musical metaphors (unstruck chords, sympathetic vibration), focus on patterns and harmonies. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-consistent ("hydraulic ghost," "liquid cartography"). Weakness: register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("wordless conversation conducted through the medium of organic decay") that sits uncomfortably against sensory immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and sustains it, though some phrases feel slightly over-written for the POV's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Elara's professional-oracle lens and fever-recovery state. Perceptual signature is distinctive: "isobars had danced like fever dreams," "reality and hallucination bleeding together in watercolor washes," and the anemometer shadow as "finger pointing toward the margins" all reflect her meteorological training and current disorientation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during smudging, slightly wider during reflection on weeks of denial). Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—technical terms (barometric pressure, isobars, scree) anchor voice, and elevated phrasing ("fault-tolerant oracle," "logarithmic records") fits her scientist role. No head-hopping. Minor note: "specific gravity of what she had consumed" in paragraph 5 is a shade abstract for peak emotional pressure, though the metaphor is internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; distance modulates purposefully (close in her skepticism, pulled back for the tunnel's architecture). Perceptual signature is consistent: she interprets frantic calls as "geographically specific details," refuses "divine intervention or spectral presence," yet registers workers as negative space rather than ghosts. Diction fits an investigator's idiom ("appraise the artifact's physical reality," "validate his confession with physical evidence," "architectural rush of decay and entropy"). One register drift stands out: "drowsy alertness where exhaustion and adrenaline performed their balancing act" and "creating drafts mimicking respiration" edge toward elevated phrasing that slightly exceeds the established texture, though the effect remains largely legible. Rhythmic control tightens during the discovery beat (shorter clauses, concrete nouns) and loosens in reflection, supporting pressure. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose establishes a distinct, meditative register with purposeful compression and lyric phrasing ("drift of untold seasons," "crumbling peace"). POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual selection reflects the chronicle keeper's archival lens. However, diction occasionally elevates into abstract philosophizing ("tyranny of interpretation," "beautiful entropy") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elara with consistent perceptual signature (music therapist's attention to breathing, rhythm, adaptive playing). Diction remains character-appropriate throughout. However, register drifts into elevated/poetic mode in several beats: "filament of sound," "prehistoric and eternal," "biological time rather than mechanical seconds." These moments feel more authorial than Elara's practiced, grounded perspective. Milo's single line of dialogue ("Again") is pitch-perfect and carries enormous weight. The prose texture is distinct but occasionally overreaches for lyricism at the expense of voice modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated, poetic register with strong perceptual signature: "bronze quiet," "dust motes dancing," "mnemonically." Focalization is stable single-POV with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the repository of human experience from sleeping minds to waking walls") that dilutes immediacy, and the phrase "odd historian of the New Stillness" reads as convenient labeling. Under peak emotional pressure (weeping, dawn transcription), the voice texture remains uniform rather than compressing or shifting rhythm to reflect strain.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance and perceptual filter (tide pools, musical metaphors). Narrative certainty occasionally oversteps what Elias can plausibly know: "What nobody knew, not even Elias himself" and "She knew what Elias did not" imply omniscient access. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, though "transpose," "modulate," "orchestrate" recur to the point of template cadence. One brief exchange of dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Register remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian throughout. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated philosophical register ("muffled clarity resolved into pure understanding," "suffocating weight of clarity, muted and absolute") that feels more essayistic than character-particular. Diction stays ornate even under peak pressure, reducing urgency. The entity's dialogue ("You decorate with silence because you fear what noise would reveal") and Elian's responses are articulate but lack subtext or goal-driven friction; they trade abstract propositions rather than wounding or evading. Perceptual signature is weak—Elian notices concepts more than sensory immediacies.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("chronological displacement," "logarithmic spiral," "symphonies...between heartbeats") that reads more like authorial gloss than character-particular idiom. Register remains consistently high throughout; under peak pressure the voice does not degrade or compress, which flattens the sense of crisis. Purposeful lyricism is present, but the texture feels uniform rather than modulated by stress.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    Register is elevated and abstract throughout, drifting into prompt vocabulary ("periodically eternal," "impossible timeframe," "quantum foam") that clashes with immediate sensory pressure. Psychic distance is distant; no perceptual signature or rhythmic control under stress. Single-sentence length and syntactic templates (dependent clause + main assertion) repeat across the piece. POV is stable but generic; the voice could belong to any high-concept narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Elara reads lips "with the precision of someone who had known her since childhood," and tactile focus dominates. Mathew's single line of dialogue feels voice-appropriate. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak pressure: "audibly muted chamber exploded against her palms in waves she could finally perceive as distinct syllables of pressure" uses abstractions ("syllables of pressure") that dilute immediacy. Free indirect style is clean, but syntactic patterns repeat: multiple sentences open with "She" + past-tense verb across the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature filters the world through meteorological metaphor ("barometric shifts in human behavior," "storm systems circumvent high-pressure barriers"). Diction is controlled and distinct, with professional idiom woven naturally. However, register drifts toward elevated abstraction in peak moments: "biosecurity theater," "layered tranquility," "greenhouse for facts" read slightly essayistic rather than lived thought under pressure. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully but occasionally prioritizes lyric polish over immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the poet notices in images and metaphors ("sheets of silk burning with internal starlight," "geometry of eternal return"). Psychic distance is stable; diction ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") fits the poet's philosophical register. However, several stretches of elevated, nearly oracular phrasing ("the moment where a cord holds together only because it has been stressed nearly to breaking") blur the line between the poet's thought and authorial commentary, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature is acoustically oriented ("acoustically perceptive enough to hear the bowl beginning to hum"). However, the prose tilts toward elevated register that sometimes feels imposed rather than voice-motivated: "magnificent simplicity," "the elegance of processes," "radiantly undone." Under peak stress (the performance), diction remains uniformly lyric rather than compressing or sharpening. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation; the narrator maintains the same reflective remove throughout, flattening urgency. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she understood") are present but not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in tight third limited to Kael. Perceptual signature is consistent (static electricity sensing, professional filter on emotions). Diction is elevated and purposeful ("subsume," "sympathetic vibration," "fossilized gold") and remains within Kael's dealer lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext ("You gave me more than half"). Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control is present, though some phrasing ("professionally thorough," "affectionate detachment") repeats without variation under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice is distinct and coherent through turns, supporting the tone of detached fascination.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited stance with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("cautious exuberance," "spiritual liberation," "unspoken beauty") that exceeds the focalizer's immediate perception during summary passages. Perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices abstractions ("fierce compassion," "invisible labor") rather than concrete, character-specific details. Dialogue with Clara is functional but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("geometries that whispered of drowning and resurrection," "luminescent ache"), but elevated diction occasionally clashes with narrative urgency. Kael's perceptual signature is generic—poetic observations that could belong to any artist-narrator. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "I offer the reeds"); when it appears, it lacks subtext or goal pursuit. The final "Years later" shift abandons Kael's immediacy for distant retrospective, weakening focalization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature shows in her illustrator's lens (iridescence, compound eyes, capturing truth). Diction stays consistent with her role ("vellum," "chronicle-moths," "temporal pocket") though under peak pressure some phrasing elevates into ornate register ("acoustic womb," "primordial dark") that slightly distances the reader. No head-hopping. Free indirect thought is clean. Rhythm modulates with urgency—longer, layered sentences during the sculpting, shorter beats as the canals drain—supporting the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elian's perspective. Diction is controlled and atmospheric, with purposeful compression ("silver gleam of mineral deposits," "vectors and angles, a language older than sorrow"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("spectral equations," "calculus of hope," "emotional architecture") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The prose texture is consistent but lacks the perceptual signature of Elian's specific bias; his way of noticing reads generic for a grief-stricken conjurer.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("gardener's patience," "arteries beneath the reading rooms"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, using technical terms (ferromagnetic tape, iron oxide) within Maya's plausible lexicon as a maintenance dweller. Under peak emotional moments (uncovering fragments, remembering her grandmother), the prose maintains rhythm without collapsing into filter verbs or over-articulation. Minor register drift: "vessels of sense memory" and "pregnant with possibility" feel slightly elevated for a character described through tactile, maintenance-world detail. Free indirect style is clean throughout. No head-hopping or tense inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Maren's scientific vocabulary grounding the lens ("taxonomic framework," "calibrated nutrient drips," "grow lights timed to the nanosecond"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately through reflection. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak realization beats: "the reluctant metamorphosis beginning in her chest," "a hybrid of scientist and servant," "sustaining transformation." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-particular under pressure. The perceptual signature—botanical specificity—is consistent, but syntactic patterns recur (parallel constructions beginning with "She" and "The") creating mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct: elevated diction ("wryly earnest," "thresh meaning," "haggard awe") fits a painter-intellectual narrator and remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional and carries subtext (Maren's "you look like hell" and the ritual exchange phrases). The perceptual signature is selective (notices light on amber, clay smell, the shape of erosion) and character-specific. Minor: "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" are stated as labels in narration rather than fully dramatized through gesture and choice, though the tone does modulate appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in Elara's third-person limited with strong perceptual signature ("admission tasting like copper," "sensation of future-memories blooming"). The pilgrim's dialogue ("The unseen forces do not announce their vessels to those who look only forward") carries a slightly elevated, archaic register that feels voice-consistent for a transformed figure. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt the familiar tug," "realized then," "understood that"), dulling immediacy. Purposeful compression ("bright darkness," "layered darkness and internal light") supports the lyric texture, but the final paragraph's dense interiority slightly slows the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices "absences," "empty spaces," "invisible coastlines." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the vision sequence. The woman's dialect ("cracking like dried seaweed") is vivid but not distinct from Kael's narration; her brief speech does not establish a separate voice. Some filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") are acceptable given the reflective register, but "Kael realized that to navigate absences was not to fill them" shifts into expository summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("analytically artistic," mapmaker's eye) is asserted more than enacted—Elara notices angles and gradients but the prose does not modulate diction or rhythm to reflect technical expertise under pressure. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("fortress of unspoken truths," "negative space between words people were afraid to speak") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she called") appear but are voice-consistent. Psychic distance remains controlled; tense is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with Mara's perceptual signature clear (spectacles, notebooks, empirical focus). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure—short bursts during the vision cascade, longer syntax during renovation planning. The single line of dialogue ("Close your eyes...") carries subtext and advances plot, but the narration occasionally slips into elevated diction ("braided together with the melancholy intelligence") that reads slightly outside Mara's established empirical register during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (dimensional awareness colors every observation). Diction is elevated and voice-particular, though register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical phrasing ("topology of continuance," "magnetic signature of what came after") that feels more authorial than Kael's embodied thought under peak stress. Psychic distance widens during the climax when the piece zooms into cosmic abstraction rather than anchoring in Kael's immediate sensation. No dialogue present; focalization otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice attempts a literary register—"cosmic inversion," "algebraic proofs," "deathly vitality"—but diction drifts into abstraction under pressure rather than tightening to Maya's mathematical particularity. Psychic distance wobbles: we get close interiority ("her mathematically honest mind") yet also omniscient framing ("the formula eluded her still"). Filter verbs proliferate without voice motivation. No dialogue appears, so character distinction through speech is untested. The prose reads competent but not voice-specific; another character could narrate these beats with minimal adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature evident in passages like "fingertips that knew only the weight of vanished things" and "emotional barometric pressures." Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the contemplative register. Some lines approach overwriting—"incandescent restraint," "blooming labyrinth," "frozen lightning"—but remain voice-motivated and legible. The final paragraph's rhythm accelerates slightly ("worked faster now, though still with that incandescent restraint") to reflect urgency without breaking the established cadence. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "sounds had grain, silence had weight." Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, filtering reality through texture and sediment metaphors. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, balancing lyric density with clarity. Under peak pressure (the final paragraph), the voice maintains its textural idiom without drifting into abstraction. No dialogue is present; the piece's singular focalization and sensory vocabulary create a memorable narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-limited holds without head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful elevation ("ephemeral compass," "resonant hums"). However, register drifts toward the prompt's own language in key beats: "gloomy cheerfulness," "universal riddle," and "ephemeral compass" recur as labels rather than being dramatized through perception. Under peak pressure (playing the cello, final walk), the prose remains fluent but relies on abstract philosophical vocabulary that edges outside embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "underutilized verticality," "as if joy could be spreadsheeted and history depreciated" captures Maya's professional-yet-rooted stance. Perceptual signature shows her dual lens ("orderly intuitive" translates to mapping systems while reading emotional currents). However, register occasionally drifts into prompt-echo abstraction: "orderly intuitive by nature" and "hopeful desperation" are diagnostic labels rather than embodied perception. The prose carries distinct texture in metaphor (barnacles, tide water, bruised purples), and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider carnival observation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; perceptual signature is consistently professional-elegiac (noticing "fusion-glass veins," "interference pattern of impact melt"). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure: technical vocabulary ("regolith," "ferricyanide," "terminator line") anchors her expertise while poetic compression ("razor-thin crescent," "cathedral of gold and obsidian") reflects emotional stakes without register clash. Psychic distance tightens during the hypothermic vigil and opens slightly for the final reflective descent. Minor texture issue: "drowning in black velvet" and "jaws of progress" edge toward stock metaphor but recover quickly through specific technical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV focused on Mira's heightened non-visual perception. Sensory details are filtered through her specialized awareness ("feeling the micro-fractures," "thermal patterns and acoustic signatures"). However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-grounded: "perpetual twilight of gray vapor," "the piece's breathing rhythm," "magnetic calm settled deeper." Key technical descriptions ("light bent through fluid mediums generated frequencies discernible to her heightened hearing") read expository. The voice remains uniform throughout rather than modulating with pressure or embodying her particular mental texture under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Marlow's atlas-editor idiom ("particular disdain," "subtly confident," "dry authority of an editor correcting a final proof") is consistent and voice-specific. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, with purposeful compression ("the world folded inward like a paper map"). The falcon dialogue ("Yes, yes, I herald your return") feels slightly performed rather than natural, a minor slip. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure: longer descriptive sentences in observation beats, clipped syntax at the transmission moment. Filter verbs ("watching," "realizing") are sparse and voice-motivated. No pronoun confusion or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with high psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent (sound-focused, patient, archival) but lacks idiosyncratic texture—diction could belong to many solemn chroniclers. No dialogue to test. Prose rhythm modulates effectively (short urgent beats at the quickening, longer reflection earlier). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("polyrhythm that spoke of acceptance rather than dominion") without voice-specific grounding, and the phrase "infinitely patient" recurs as a tell rather than shown constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Perceptual signature is present in the dive-specific details (thermocline, oxygen gauge, decompression chamber) but the elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "gathered hush," "ephemeral") repeats without character-specific motivation. No dialogue to evaluate. The phrase "touched memories" recurs as a motif but reads as authorial pattern rather than Elara's idiolect. Under peak stress (drinking the vial, exhaling air) the prose maintains its lyric register without compression or degradation, which flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (narrative-physics conceit, copperlight repose) and voice is lyric-elevated throughout. However, register ("particular dust of abandoned sanctity," "narrative physics," "copperlight repose") drifts above Elias's prisoner context without dramatic anchoring—diction reads authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance stays close but the lens feels imposed rather than earned by a protagonist who has spent seven years in a granite cell.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Julian's experience in the second half; Eira's interiority in the opening and closing bookends creates a dual-focalization structure with clean section breaks, qualifying under Track C. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings," "mournful elation") but borders on ornamental lyricism that prioritizes texture over the character's plausible lexicon under stress. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You cultivated these trees…," "The debt…," "Take it to the fields") but lacks subtext or resistance that would reveal character hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with a poetic narrative voice that privileges metaphor and elevated diction ("orchid solace," "hauntingly optimistic," "filigree patterns in the sandstone that matched the veins in her hands"). The prose is distinctive and consistent, but the register drifts into abstraction under pressure rather than tightening into Maren's immediate perception. Filter verbs and summary constructions ("she had seen," "she knew," "Maren understood") distance the reader from embodied experience. Purposeful compression is evident, but the piece does not teach a pattern that pays off at closure; instead, it sustains one tone throughout, missing an opportunity to modulate rhythm as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with perceptual signature filtered through excavation and diaspora return (genetic memory, internal compass). Diction is elevated and often lyric ("small mouth waiting to speak," "geometry of the orchard"), which fits the meditative tone but occasionally drifts into register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("cautiously enchanted grove," "warmly curious insistence"). Psychic distance is controlled, though some phrases read as summary-level reflection rather than immediate perception. No dialogue present; internal voice coheres but lacks the rough edges or contradictions that would sharpen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature (archaeologist metaphor, attention to margins and texture) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space between futures," "cathedral to tactile experience") that feels essayistic rather than Kael's lived perception under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates with urgency ("worked feverishly") but some reflective passages ("dying traditions," "ultimate subversion") read as thematic exposition rather than embodied thought. Psychic distance wobbles between close observation and authorial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register: "conspirators' footsteps three floors below, though no one else had learned to read that geometry yet." However, perceptual certainty occasionally exceeds what Mira can plausibly know in real time ("the coup would come with the first frost; she had heard it in the unspoken pauses"). Some phrases risk ornamental elevation ("galaxy-chart embroiderer, obsessed with celestial thread-counts") that slightly pulls away from immediate embodiment. Dialogue (the captain's exchange) is spare and functional, avoiding false complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("the melody of almost-regret," "wet origami," "mercury between the roots"). However, diction frequently exceeds what feels character-particular under crisis: "anticipated grief masquerading as self-protection" and "liminal eddy" read as authorial rather than Elara's lived perception in the moment. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. Psychic distance remains consistent, but perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than Elara-specific filtering—her professional medium lens does not color sensory detail or thought in a way distinct from stock mystical narration. Free indirect style is clean, though the elevated register flattens emotional peaks: "fierce tenderness" repeats as a phrase rather than being embodied in varied syntax or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature (translator's eye, surgical precision) is character-specific. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally slips into academic register ("encrypting their grief," "decrypting it daily") that feels authorial rather than character-lived. No dialogue on the page. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is strong in the opening and closing paragraphs but the middle section loops similar syntactic patterns ("She began to unknot… She had come… She would tell").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyrical register: "logic wore soft edges," "time breathed slowly," "fog her infinite wall." Perceptual signature filters through an artist's lens—chromatic joy, symphonies of color, alchemical marriage. Psychic distance compresses during peak creation ("Mara laughed, the sound surprising her") without head-hopping. Elevated diction ("mycorrhizal threads," "phosphorescent pigments") fits the voice-motivated aesthetic consciousness. Register drifts slightly into expository clarity during the knowledge-network explanation and the "exposed film had done its work" summary, where the voice smooths into explanatory mode rather than maintaining the dreamy compression established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable, and Elena's perceptual signature (color-restorer noticing "chromatic life," "hue") is present. Yet diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register incongruent with scene pressure: "sliver of eternity," "nested awakenings intensified," "generous space between knowing and seeking." Psychic distance is inconsistent—close interiority ("The bewitching was complete") alternates with distant summary ("She understood now"). The phrase "methodically playful" recurs as a tic rather than voice-specific rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct texture—"casualty of a man who had never paid a single thought tax," "entropy" as code—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with moment-to-moment urgency ("cathedral of glass," "fragile ecosystem requiring constant tending"). Dialogue between Elias and Voss reads purposefully cryptic but lacks subtext beyond surface meaning; the exchange advances plot without revealing contradictory wants. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "crystalline clarity" in paragraph five reads as filter intrusion rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices sound ("ocean dream in currents older than language"), texture (postcard edges "softened by the salt of her tears and the patience of stone"), and transformation. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her immediate frame—"to photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "reef-shadow joy" read more authorial than character-rooted—creating mild register drift at peak beats. The piece uses purposeful compression and lyric patterning ("shyly unstoppable," "off-key wind") that are taught early and remain legible. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is consistent, but the voice leans ornamental when pressure should intensify embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent distance. Perceptual signature is present ("cloud-mist," "crystalline geometry") but drifts toward elevated diction that doesn't feel character-specific under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the narrative stance is coherent. However, register occasionally slips into ornamental lyricism ("the air tasted of violet nostalgia and rusted triumph") that reads more authorial than filtered through the caretaker's working mind.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent: "semantic binding," "ochre and forgotten grammar," "calcified into a wall." However, under peak pressure the register remains unchanged—no compression or shift when Elara inscribes the promises or when Julian arrives. Dialogue at the end feels slightly formal ("I couldn't let the paths diverge without trying") given months of silence and high emotion. Elara's perceptual signature (linguist's attention to grammar, meaning, dead tongues) is clear and character-specific. Filter verbs ("feeling the hum," "aware that one misstep") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single-POV focalization holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature leans technical (spectrometer traces, hydraulic choreography, graduated chain measurements) but interior texture often slips into elevated academic register ("crystalline clarity," "slyly heartfelt," "moral imagination") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic for a grease-stained machinist. The prose is legible and purposeful but the diction converges on an eloquent narrator voice disconnected from embodied stress—under peak pressure (tremor, discovery risk) syntax remains uniformly ornate rather than compressing or fracturing. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "remembered") are functional but cluster without urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated, lyric register ("foxing paper and pigeon feed, a peculiar perfume," "each particle a fragment of forgotten stories") that remains legible but drifts toward a poetic idiom not always anchored in Elara's immediate perception under pressure. Distance control is clean, though several reflective passages ("She understood now that her deepest motivation," "She had spent months calculating") summarize rather than dramatize knowledge shifts. No dialogue is present, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled. Diction ("featherly determined," "mathematical tenderness," "liturgical instructions") sustains an elevated, lyric register throughout, matching the post-collapse metaphysical premise. However, the prose occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction—"spectral geometries," "the fractured hush"—that reads as atmospheric overlay rather than Elara's perceptual signature under pressure. Perceptual filtering remains generic; urgency does not compress or sharpen her noticing in the final approach. Voice is consistent but not character-particular enough to feel irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV third limited is stable with no head-hopping, and the piece maintains a consistent elevated register ("landscape astrologer," "shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite"). Perceptual signature reads distinct—Elara notices starlight patterns, architectural breathing, the geometry of connection—though the diction occasionally drifts into prompted neologisms ("shadowseam," "softly ingenious," "rhythm of belonging") that feel imposed rather than earned through voice. Dialogue between Elara and the phantom ("The canyon sings at dawn," "Breathe with me") carries subtext of shared purpose but remains brief. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance shifts intentionally to mark discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited and the perceptual signature—"sea-foam hair drifting like mist," prismatic light—is lyrically consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("transliterate emotions," "conjecture," "conceptual repricing") that sits awkwardly with the mystical-artisan voice, creating mild distance wobble. Interiority relies on filter verbs and label-only feelings ("cheerful gloom," "comfortable sadness") without embodied contradiction. No dialogue to assess. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm flattens under stacked descriptive clauses in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and often vivid ("salt spray drifted," "chaos mathematics," "sediment"), though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("monotony was a prison built from unexamined patterns") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Perceptual signature is present (Kael notices trajectories, coefficients, acoustics) but lacks embodied sensory texture under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent. No dialogue present to evaluate. The voice is competent but not distinctive enough to charge peak beats with rhythm or compression that heightens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    The third-person narration maintains consistent distance but drifts into elevated register that exceeds the scene's grounding ("spontaneously anchored to the geometry of the words," "hybrid creature of verse and violation"). Key transformation moments are asserted with abstract vocabulary rather than shown through perception. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew") stack without voice motivation. The prose voice reads as external commentary rather than Kaelin's particular way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is evident in the glazier's framing (silica, grinding wheel, geometric panes). Diction, however, drifts into elevated register—"noctilucent reckonings," "incandescent," "spectral components"—that strains against the blue-collar profession without clear voice motivation. The phrase "definitive moment before everything shifts" repeats the opening's "fragile hour before everything shifts" in slightly altered form, suggesting template reliance rather than rhythm variation. Filter verbs ("he understood," "he read," "he would understand") cluster in reflective beats but remain legible as interior process. No dialogue is present to assess. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, yet the lexical reach (noctilucent, reckonings) feels imported rather than character-organic, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Maya; no head-hopping. The voice carries a heightened, lyric register throughout—"gently skilled hands," "the slow dance of celestial bodies," "burns mapping constellations"—that reads as authorial polish rather than Maya's internal idiom under pressure. Elias's single line of dialogue ("I can't sleep… I see her face") feels natural, but the surrounding narration elevates into literary diction ("his voice cracking like old porcelain") that slightly distances the reader from raw emotion. The piece maintains internal consistency, but the perceptual signature is more textured-prose than character-particular, and the diction does not degrade or compress under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with purposeful diction ("cartographer of the possible," "coefficient that could be altered"). However, the prose exhibits register drift into academic abstraction ("inverse but equally systematic means," "rigorous calculation") that lacks body or urgency. Perceptual signature is present but static: Elara observes with mathematical detachment throughout, never modulating under stress. No dialogue appears. The narrative stance remains declarative rather than dramatizing her split consciousness or the pressure of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Mara; psychic distance is controlled and deepens appropriately at key moments. Voice carries a distinct poetic texture ("ivy-veiled passage," "topography of memory," "stubborn persistence of witness") that remains consistent and apt for a contemplative post-apocalyptic exploration. Perceptual signature is clear: Mara notices structural details, vibrations, and echoes that others would miss, filtered through her professional lens. Some diction verges on elevated register ("sensitively perceptive," "continuity, the stubborn persistence of witness") that reads slightly external to organic thought under discovery pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or POV leakage. The prose reflects Mara's contemplative mind, though a few phrases approach thematic summary rather than dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, filtered through Elias's perceptions ("perceptively calm," "knew that persuading mirrors"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, consistent with the accumulative mode, though some phrases border on stock poeticism ("voice weaving through the damp air like smoke"). The brief dialogue ("Show them") serves as incantation rather than character interaction, appropriately muted. Perceptual signature is present but generalizes toward the mystical; under peak pressure (bells ringing, heartbeat fading) the syntax does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect urgency, maintaining uniform lyricism that slightly flattens embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a distinct texture—"peculiar softness of someone who had screamed across too many battlefields," "daily friction of choosing mercy over efficiency"—though elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic register ("anchoring ideals in practice through ritual significance"). Dialogue feels purposeful and character-distinct: the general's bitter skepticism, the child's whispered observation, Elara's measured deflection. Filter verbs ("she noted," "she had learned") appear but serve narrative distance without dulling immediacy. The prose modulates under pressure, tightening at the soil reveal, though some lines ("slow dance of celestial bodies" recurs four times) lean formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is distinct and maintains elevated, lyric register throughout: "acoustic shadow," "geometry of absence," "cathedral of salt and bone." Distance is stable third-person limited with strong perceptual filtering (Elias's grief, his reading of the cracks). However, the diction occasionally drifts into authorial commentary ("an amoral philanthropist," "the contradiction had calcified") that reads as exposition rather than Elias's interior lexicon. Psychic distance control is generally clean, though some filter verbs ("feeling its weight like a second heart") dilute immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Lys. Distance is controlled, and perceptual signature is present (she notices the tutor's exhale, the temporal filaments, the starlight geometry). However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated, poetic register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "bodily poetic," "spectral geometry," "fourth-dimensional tangles," "accumulated stillness." These phrases are lyric and purposeful but lack the specificity of Lys's lived idiom. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose rhythm supports pressure adequately, though runs of similar syntactic structures (comma-laden descriptors) create mild monotony. No head-hopping or tense slips. The voice is distinct and coherent but not character-particular enough to reach high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (calligrapher's precision, "urbane sophistication dissolving"). Diction occasionally drifts elevated: "subversive puppet shows," "plausible deniability," "consensus reality" feel more essayistic than character-particular under stress. The blind woman's dialogue is brief but distinct. Two filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages ("understood that," "recognized his own reflection"), dulling immediacy. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between scene and reflection, though the ratio of summary to dramatized choice tilts toward telling in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's philosophical lens. Perceptual signature is consistent (academic precision, cold accuracy, metaphysical weight) and diction matches her training. Psychic distance is controlled, with close access to her ritual focus. However, register drifts toward elevated abstraction in peak beats ("interrupted cadence," "blushing stillness," "esoteric realist") where embodied immediacy would sharpen pressure. Some filter verbs ("believed," "recognized") appear in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. Rhythmic control is present, yet syntactic patterns repeat (long, clause-heavy sentences with participial structures) without modulation under emotional intensity. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric density, technical vocabulary (lost wax, sinew, tensile history), metaphoric precision ("meltwater finding cracks," "circuit...conduit...mechanical medium"). POV remains stable in Elara's focalization. Distance is consistent—close third that accesses her perception and purpose without head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively between craft detail and emotional reflection. One persistent pattern: nearly every sentence in the middle third uses a three-part construction (noun, elaboration, metaphoric reweighting) that creates a drumbeat rhythm where variation would sharpen pressure, e.g., "The rope was not just fiber; it was a circuit, a conduit...a mechanical medium."

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and dense with elevated diction ("precisely playful," "retracted veins," "rewilded forest humming with electric green"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose reflects Foresight's meditative, mystical stance. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels imposed rather than character-specific ("emotional aftereffect through scene and image"), and some phrases ("vines recognized her scent," "the directive continued its decay in peace") skirt metaphorical convenience. Perceptual signature is present but could be more idiosyncratic under stress; the mushroom trip compresses perception yet syntax remains polished and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator maintains a consistent elevated register—"schematic representations," "mnemonic device," "precession of the equinoxes"—that fits an astronomer's lexicon and the archaic setting. Psychic distance is stable throughout, with no dialogue to test voice distinction, and the perception is filtered through Elior's priorities (geometries, stellar drift, numerical sequences). The prose occasionally tips into ornamental phrasing—"twilight bled," "empirically ironic nature"—that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, and "encrypted devotion" as a concept risks abstraction, but the perceptual signature (seeing architecture as cipher, feeling wonder as data betrayal) remains character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Distance control is consistent, though the register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the architecture of compassion laid like trapdoors beneath violence," "a cathedral coded into DNA") that exceeds Elias's plausible in-the-moment lexicon during a high-pressure confrontation. The entity's dialogue ("I don't intend to pacify you") reads as thesis-driven rather than character-specific speech. Perceptual signature is present in the sanctuary's sensory particulars (vibration, translucence, silence) but flattens during the climax into conceptual narration. No dialogue naturalism issues since all speech is stylized by the soundless-sanctuary conceit, but the "words writing themselves directly into Elias's nervous system" functions as filter that distances rather than sharpens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices through an artisan's lens (silica, silver nitrate, angles). Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "boundary between the mind and the ruined world had grown thin as breath on a cold mirror, erasing itself with every passing cloud" occasionally drift into lyric abstraction that obscures immediate causality. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the ritual. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; Mara's perceptual signature (quartz-eye stress-fracture vision, professional mender diction) is consistent and character-specific. The monologue to absent figures ("She spoke of how some breaches...") compresses dialogue into summary-tell, flattening immediacy when a single dramatized micro-exchange could have lifted it. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms to sap-stained hands at twilight). One register hiccup: "deciduous vows were not lesser promises, but honest ones, acknowledging that growth required shedding" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, though it's narratorial and not unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose establishes a lyric, elevated register ("brightened disquiet," "recursive logic," "narrative limbo") that remains consistent throughout. However, diction often drifts into abstraction ("simply complicated paradox," "quantum uncertainty") that obscures rather than reveals perceptual specificity. No dialogue appears. The voice reads as authorial-philosophical rather than character-particular, and the elevated register never modulates under pressure, flattening emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose establishes a consistent elevated register ("vertiginous darkness," "semantic voids," "conditional tense") that suits an arcane linguist's perception. However, diction remains uniform across emotional beats—no modulation when Elara realizes her expertise is worthless or when she descends to the library. The narrator's certainty about abstractions ("which operated on principles of linguistic exchange") exceeds what can be concretely observed. Elara's perceptual signature (noticing linguistic gaps, botanical rhythms) is specific, but the voice does not compress or shift under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("You cannot extract him") arrives without prior speech patterns to distinguish it, reading more as thematic declaration than goal-driven utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Maya's focalization throughout; no head-hopping occurs. Voice has a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("memories altered the architecture") and consistent diction, though some phrases verge on purple ("vibrating with a different version of their history"). The prose maintains psychic distance and stays within Maya's perceptual frame. However, filter-verb stacks ("She could see it now," "She understood that to recapture") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. Perceptual signature is present but not highly individuated; the narrative stance reads more as poetic narrator than character-specific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the diction carries a consistent archival formality ("warmly methodical," "reverent precision"). However, the prose frequently drifts into elevated, abstracted register that distances us from Elara's lived perception: "narratives that explained why certain histories never occurred" and "the dizzying multiplicity of potential pasts in perfect clarity" read more like narrative summary than embodied thought. At peak moments (the actual reconfiguration), we get declaration of her skill rather than the sensory and cognitive texture of the work itself. No distinct perceptual signature—what Elara uniquely notices or ignores—emerges to anchor voice in character.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature filtering the world through acoustic and geological metaphors ("trapped bees," "ink in water," "beaten copper"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and the narrative certainty matches Mara's expertise. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("psychic shrieking," "null-song," "hammered repose") that reads more authorial than character-specific under peak stress, and some figurative phrasing feels ornamental rather than voice-urgent. The prose reflects Mara's specialist lens but could tighten the syntactic texture to better embody her mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout. Diction elevates consistently—"bruised twilight," "retrocognitively blessed," "shard of hush expanding outward"—creating a lyric texture appropriate to the post-collapse setting. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("dormant potentials," "syntax, a language written in probability") that dilutes immediacy during key beats. Perceptual signature (Elara's backward-seeing, pattern-reading lens) is coherent. Paragraph 4's "thistle-blown hope across the devastation" verges on overt thematic statement but remains imagistic. The prose modulates with pressure: shorter clauses as she climbs, longer unspooling as light ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (angle measurements, storm-light, geometry) and voice remains elevated but stable. Diction is controlled: "susurrus," "actinic white," "conjecture" fit the archivist role. However, the prose reads more like lyric exposition than interior particularity under pressure—phrases such as "preemptively nostalgic for the stories she had not yet transcribed" feel crafted for the reader rather than thought by Elara. Psychic distance is stable but the narrator's certainty about transformation ("she understood that she was both archivist and archive") asserts insight without dramatizing the cost. No dialogue; voice is coherent but lacks a sharp perceptual edge.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated diction ("filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness," "hush of a night with no stars," "gravity of hopelessness") that remains consistent and voice-motivated, lending a lyric texture. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elian notices via abstract awareness rather than character-specific bias, and his rhythmic control under pressure does not compress or sharpen diction at peak beats. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative's confidence matches what the focalizer can plausibly know. Free indirect style is clean, but the lack of embodied, contradictory perception under stress and the reliance on elevated register without micro-variation keep the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (watching Maya's indirection, understanding her "tangential path") is consistent. Free indirect style blends cleanly when channeling Maya's philosophy. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Maya's cicada story advances through indirection, the narrator's final offer shifts the conversational stakes. Minor weakness: some phrasing ("the delicate negotiation between them," "the most honest transition period of all") edges toward essayistic register during peak moments, slightly distancing the reader from lived experience. Psychic distance otherwise modulates purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping; psychic distance is close, filtering setting and action through Mara's perception. Voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical texture ("claustrophobia coiled in her blood like a snake refusing the dark," "the silence tasted of honey and dust"). Diction is elevated and patterned ("stretching contracted," "intangibly tangible," "xenial"), fitting the accumulative/textural mode and teaching the reader its recurrence early. Perceptual signature is present: Mara notices ozone, pressure, horizon, the weight of the world. However, under peak stress (the churning clouds, the sprint), the register remains uniformly lyric and abstract rather than compressing into sharper, more immediate syntax—no modulation toward urgency at the sentence level. The "stretching contracted" and "intangibly tangible" constructions recur without micro-variation, creating a slight template cadence. No dialogue present; no penalty applies. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear but fit the reflective voice. Tense and stance are stable.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in Mara's close third; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct textural signature (crystalline dendrites, vaulting hush, spectral ribbons) that reflects Mara's professional lens. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("catalyze," "fluidly logical cadence," "calcified architecture of regret") that reads more like authorial commentary than character-specific thought under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Listen...") is serviceable but carries minimal subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent but ornamental rather than tactically biased.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable throughout; diction ("quantum superposition," "liminal hours," "membrane of suspended droplets") sustains a consistent futuristic-archival register. Perceptual signature reflects Elara's lore-keeper role through attention to murals, codes, and cultural fragments. However, psychic distance stays uniform across beats—no modulation under peak pressure—and the final paragraphs summarize her return and compositional intentions ("already composing the new entries") rather than filtering the summit experience through embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. However, the diction is uniformly elevated and abstract ("tender shadow keeper," "encroachment upon the space he had fortified from their mutual ruins"), creating a lyric register that distances emotional immediacy. Dialogue is sparse and laden with metaphor ("You taught me to suffocate," "linking through scars") that feels more authorial than character-driven under stress. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Elias's way of noticing (starlight, cinders, ridges) lacks idiosyncratic bias. The prose texture is consistent but does not modulate convincingly under the peak transmission beat, remaining at one lyric pitch throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—filtering mushroom glow through ruined portfolios, recognizing the bolt's "pressures that could crush submarines into origami"—is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("shadowseam wonder," "virtuously mischievous," "translate crushing force into clarity") that feels authorial rather than Maya's lived idiom under stress. The prose occasionally compresses ("quantum foam where her pyramid scheme debts had ruptured reality") in ways that read as purposeful metaphor but blur concrete causality. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though psychic distance wavers when narration asserts meta-awareness ("She understood now that the multiverse ran its own pyramids") without dramatizing the realization through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—"bridge of intuition," "oscillating silence into comprehension without the interference of spoken language." Register drift is the primary issue: elevated diction ("eloquently silent grace of a dynasty ender," "the vanilla scent of aging deceit," "invisible geometry and vibrating potential") saturates nearly every sentence, often clashing with the physical immediacy required in peak beats. The voice reads as committee consensus rather than Kael's particular perception under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally ventriloquizes the world's mythology rather than filtering through Kael's present attention.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with a consistent philosophical-lyric register, and the diction maintains elevated, precise vocabulary throughout ("factually mystical," "tessellated floor," "ozone and childhood memory"). Psychic distance is controlled, staying anchored to Valen's perception. However, the voice suffers from uniformly ornate, complex syntax that doesn't modulate under pressure; the final beats of transformation maintain the same measured, clause-heavy rhythm as the opening, flattening emotional urgency. Register drifts into quasi-academic abstraction ("theoretical points in space," "multidimensional") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, and the single spoken line—"I give you my silence"—arrives so late and briefly that it cannot establish a distinct speech idiom separate from the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with Maya's perceptual signature consistent: she reads "like a historian interprets geological strata," notices "tactfully hopeful precision," and frames discoveries through archival language. Diction stays within her professional/emotional register. No dialogue present, appropriately. The prose rhythm modulates well—compressed during discovery beats, expansive during reflection. Minor deduction: some constructions edge toward elevated literary register ("her motivation crystallizing," "the examined conviction") that slightly exceeds immediate thought under emotional pressure, and the final metaphor chain (button as method/way of reading) tilts explanatory. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, memorized documents, puddle reflections as coordinates) is present but occasionally slips into elevated register ("tyranny of indifference," "auric lagoon," "coded freedom") that feels imposed rather than organically Elias's lexicon. Psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose has textural variety (petrichor, ozone, molten gold), but some constructions—"the tyranny of indifference had nearly won," "the stubborn refusal to let dusk be the end of the story"—read as authorial commentary rather than Elias's lived thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-philosophical register: "the spaces around them," "the ghost of melodies never born," "silence so profound it had weight and texture." Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices sound-absence, light refraction, condensation—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vested hush," "negative space," "geometric pathways") that feels authorial rather than character-lived. Psychic distance is controlled, though peak moments default to conceptual metaphor instead of immediate sensory compression.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries distinct texture—"wet, ancient joy of finding life in forgotten corners"—and perceptual signature is consistent (orderly, cataloging focus on tiny objects and patterns). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains POV plausibility: "cambium," "pictographs," "vascular system" feel technical rather than lived-in for a seed sorter's internal voice, especially under emotional pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose successfully reflects Elias's methodical mind while modulating toward lyricism at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled—"uncertainly certain," "swirling leaves," "darkness held substance and weight"—with a consistent baroque-lyric register that fits the tinkerer's methodical yet intuitive worldview. Psychic distance stays tight to Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: some elevated diction ("geological patience," "hothouse flower," "vegetative reluctance") pushes the register slightly beyond what a village tinkerer might plausibly internalize under stress, creating mild distance from embodied thought. The perceptual signature (gears, springs, flow mechanics) is consistent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent register—formal, slightly archaic, weighted with alchemical terminology—that suits the setting and Elara's scholarly focus. Diction remains controlled ("kintsugi intentions," "phosphorescent certainty," "molecular structure and his favorite color") and purposeful elision (how Kael fell, what the True Name's syllables were) creates compression. However, the voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction that reads more like thematic commentary than lived perception: "factually mystical atmosphere," "regret made luminous," "the precise, unbreakable logic of her love." POV remains stable, and the single line of dialogue at the end distinguishes Kael's voice from narration without head-hopping, though his speech could carry more distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's professional focus on spectral mechanics, embodied detail (harp strings cutting her hands), and poetic diction ("luminous ache," "violet between the cliffs"). The ghost's dialogue—"You pursued me through the wrong notes"—carries subtext and feels purposeful. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the fabric of reality," "tapestry that wrapped around") that risks distancing the reader from immediate experience. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and texturally distinct—lyric, scientific, trauma-inflected—with a perceptual signature rooted in proprioceptive awareness. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("algorithm of compassion," "divine constant seeking resolution") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue. Free indirect style remains clean. Psychic distance is stable. The final line's diction ("how much light could pass through a broken place") feels earned, but earlier equation metaphors read as thematic overlay rather than Elena's natural idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices brushstrokes, pigment, encoded patterns. Diction is elevated and lyric ("elusively tangible," "drowned depths," "smoke that remembers it was once bone"), which fits the voice-motivated register of a mystical translator. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") appear frequently but remain legible. However, the prose occasionally tips into over-ornamentation during peak beats (the unfastening sequence), and the final paragraph summarizes the effect rather than dramatizing it, weakening the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Maya; perceptual signature is consistent with her technical observation ("hairline fractures," "dust accumulation patterns"). Diction is controlled and occupation-specific without filter-verb clutter in key beats. The ringmaster's dialogue is brief and functional; Maya's internal voice remains distinct. One phrase—"the weightless burden settled upon her shoulders"—edges toward stock metaphor but is then charged by recurrence. No head-hopping; distance is consistent. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately, slowing for analysis and quickening for the installation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and elevated, with a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("cartographer reads contested territories," "vacuum abhorred matter"). Diction remains stable and purposeful throughout, and psychic distance is controlled. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels ornamental rather than character-specific ("the reluctance of reality itself fighting against the impending rupture"). No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans cerebral; under the final beat's pressure, the syntax remains stately rather than modulating to reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable single-narrator with a distinct, elevated register ("burnished sorrow," "baroque spires"). The perceptual signature is consistent—Kaelen notices temporal swirls, architectural ornamentation, poetic inscriptions—but the voice occasionally drifts into authorial lyricism ("his words joining the amber currents") that reads more posed than character-urgent. Dialogue is absent; the council scene is summarized rather than dramatized. Under pressure (storms, presentation), the diction remains ornate rather than compressing, which slightly flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and purpose-driven, with elevated diction ("verdigris," "tether," "primordial device") that fits the archaic ritual frame. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("mending what isn't torn," "invisible threads that tether each melody to the breathing world") that sounds more like thematic narration than Elias's perceptual signature under pressure. No dialogue is present. Focalization is clean, and the prose maintains a distinct texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "sensibly eccentric," "weather grew soft and sensation reigned," "territory became alive." Diction matches Elara's scientific-yet-mystical lens (respirator for scent molecules, calcite deposits, bioluminescence, psychometry). Narrative distance is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from embodied perception into essayistic turns: "where the boundary between memory and geology dissolved into something that predated both" reads more like retrospective analysis than live experience under the headlamp. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though some filter verbs ("she understood now," "she knew") could be tighter in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Mara throughout. Perceptual signature shows through her sculptor's lens (reading ocean moods, recognizing joinery, letting grain dictate form). However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis urgency: "turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances," and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" repeat as phrase-patterns rather than voiced thought. Filter verbs appear appropriately ("she understood," "she realized," "she saw") without excess. The narrative maintains psychic distance but voice feels more like external narration of a sculptor than the sculptor's own lived perception under pressure. Syntax remains clear but falls into template cadence with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; perceptual signature is consistent (artist noticing "burnt sienna," "honeyed light," "layers of shadow and silver"). The sexton's single line of dialogue feels natural and purposeful. However, diction drifts elevated in peak beats: "reckon with the years," "sediment clearing from deep water," "umbral tenderness" read slightly above Lyra's working artist register. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Narrative distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; psychic distance is consistent. Voice carries an elevated, incantatory register ("searing reverie," "benediction," "communion") that matches the otherworldly premise and maintains texture under pressure. However, diction drifts into abstraction at peak beats: "boundaries between archivist and casualty, between record and flesh" and "the lattice of arranged debris that now formed a bridge" layer metaphor on metaphor without grounding in immediate sensory anchor. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood," "watching") stack in the descent and kneeling sequence, dulling immediacy when the prose needs embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices architectural angles and material properties—but diction drifts into academic register ("neural architectures of remembrance," "tensile strength of communal bonds," "compressed potential") that sits uneasily with her alchemist identity. Filter verbs ("She understood immediately," "She needed to conceive") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate. The elevated prose occasionally obscures whether thoughts are hers or narratorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet disquiet," "vegetal memory"), though register occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("the archive was not a library but a conversion") that feels authorial rather than Elias's lived perception. The third-grade memory is told with concrete sensory detail, but the transition into it lacks a present-tense anchor—Elias "understood" rather than discovering through a specific present cue. Perceptual signature is generic mysticism rather than character-particular noticing. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—botanical and temporal focus ("chlorophyll and memory," "lignin out of lignified silence")—is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains credibility for a character mid-action ("decreasing entropy," "quantum probabilities," "lignified silence"), though these terms align with the piece's speculative-scientific idiom. Psychic distance fluctuates: some lines occupy tight embodied perception ("bark under fingernails") while others assert omniscient certainty about vortex mechanics without anchoring in Elara's subjective experience. Filter verbs ("understanding that," "she understood now") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a measured, archaic-inflected register appropriate to the high-sanctuary setting. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration occasionally drifts toward helpful-narrator mode ("This was the moment—zero hour—when tradition and innovation must reconcile"). Elara's professional lexicon (microclimate variations, barometer, anemometer) grounds her perspective, but her internal voice lacks the perceptual signature of distinct bias or blind spot. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose is clean but the voice feels generic-literary rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Elian's spiritual lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"cosmic janitor," "cathedral of amber shadows," "choreography of acceptance"—creating a distinct texture. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices celestial metaphors and existential resonance. However, elevated register at peak beats ("terminations were merely thresholds dressed in fire," "the courage to fall") occasionally drifts beyond what the focalizer's idiom might sustain under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates intentionally. Voice remains singular throughout, meeting the high-band requirement, but the prose poetry at closure slightly tensions naturalism without crossing into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature is consistent: long, meditative sentences with elevated diction ("mute eloquence," "luminous thread," "architecture of abandonment"). Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Elias's interior without head-hopping. Diction is lush and metaphor-dense but remains coherent and voice-motivated; the register fits a contemplative recluse. No dialogue present. The prose modulates subtly with the scene's quiet intensity. Minor filter-verb reliance ("watching," "observing") but within tolerance for this reflective mode. Syntax varies purposefully, creating a lyric rhythm that supports tone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person close on Elara; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture with controlled diction ("miser clutching fading photographs," "verdant hue that predated the chromatic shift"). Psychic distance remains consistent. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices chronology, texture, and sequential existence. Under peak stress (the fragment absorption), compression is purposeful and the internal voice holds. Minor register drift: "sovereign continuity" and "chronology" lean academic but remain within the focalizer's lexicon as a timekeeper. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—the poet notices "burnished hush," "barbs separated near the tip," sensory textures filtered through her aesthetic practice. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("I can fix it" / "It's broken" / "Yes"). The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to the beauty that exists not despite damage, but because of it") that feels more like authorial framing than the poet's lived thought under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent but the final paragraph's summary mode ("she would return tomorrow to discover beauty") softens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices orchard details with quiet precision—but voice converges toward elevated literary diction ("botanical fear," "gospel of coexistence") that doesn't modulate under stress. Diction remains stable yet slightly generic; many sentences open with subject-verb templates ("He wrapped," "Elias documented," "Visitors remarked"). Psychic distance stays mid-range throughout; no intimate compression during peak beats. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("particular luminosity," "bronze quiet," "cortisol levels, dopamine responses, cellular memories"). However, diction frequently drifts into academic abstraction that feels more like the prompt's language than Elara's lived interiority under pressure—phrases such as "molecular signature of displacement" and "synthesis of who we were and what we've seen" lack perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse; when present (Maya, Vance), it carries thematic weight but minimal subtext or goal pursuit. No head-hopping, but the voice reads as committee consensus rather than singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("declensions of calcium," "avian liturgy," "subjunctive mood of Coastal Aramaic") suits a scholar-priest figure, and the purposeful compression of technical terminology creates a consistent texture. Psychic distance is stable throughout. However, register occasionally tips into ornamental excess ("a perfect expression of narrow vastness," "blue hour like a bridge") that prioritizes lyric decoration over character perception. POV modesty holds; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited through Ash's perception. Vocabulary largely fits canine focalization—scent translation, tactile engagement—though some phrases ("cartography of the heart," "impossibility gap") read as narratorial elevation beyond strict dog-mind. Perceptual signature is consistent: "copper oxidation into memory," "grooves hummed," "jowls trembling...with weight of recognition." Distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the phonograph scene and the final discovery. Figurative language occasionally breaches POV plausibility: "labyrinth," "beads of forgotten technology," "tinted revelation" feel more authorial than canine, creating minor register drift. No dialogue present. The phrase "intuitively descriptive" recurs as awkward adverbial insertion rather than organic to voice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature—temporal stretching, cartographic framing—is consistent. However, diction frequently elevates beyond immediate embodied experience: "pneumatic finality," "eons," "sympathetic resonance," "methodology" cluster in a register more lyric-essay than character-lived crisis. The voice reads authorial-poetic rather than Elara-specific under pressure. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("understood," "glimpsed") are minimal and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Kael. Diction is consistent but elevated to a fantasy register that borders on ornamental ("apprentice of wonder," "reverence that danced"). Dialogue is minimal; the guardian's single exchange is functional. Perceptual signature is weak—Kael's noticing is generic epic-quest observation rather than character-specific bias. Register drift into stock fantasy phrases ("student of awe," "cosmic game") appears in peak beats, applying −0.4 in Q6. No head-hopping, but voice lacks distinct texture beyond genre default.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "historian of small gestures"). Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature is present (Mira notices the interregnum's liminality, the chessboard's absence). However, the diction leans heavily on abstract, ornate phrasing throughout—"benevolently ruthless," "authentic suffering," "luminous absence"—creating a uniform textural layer that rarely modulates with emotional pressure. The prose reads as consistently literary rather than rhythmically responsive to scene urgency. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose sustains a distinct lyric register with controlled metaphoric density: "mercury veins flickered," "quicksilver grief," "roots finding purchase in difficult earth." POV remains stable in close third with Vey. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"indigenous rock and intention," "syntax of safety seeded into hostile ground"—that reads more authorial than character-bound. The final paragraph's summary mode ("home was not found but seeded") flattens the perceptual signature established earlier. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though some filter verbs ("understood," "realized") appear at pivotal moments where immediacy would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: chess-tutor precision filters observation (geometric pathways, endgames, strategies). Diction remains controlled and character-specific. However, elevated metaphoric register ("threads of silence that draped across the cottages like heavy velvet," "sediment clearing from disturbed water") occasionally drifts above the immediacy of a man solving a puzzle under existential pressure. Psychic distance is steady, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Kael notices "porous surface," "hollow sound," "forged hush"—but some lines drift into elevated register ("the willingness to let their truth be changed") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under peak stress. Dialogue is minimal and goal-driven; Lira's child voice ("But you keep making noise") contrasts with Kael's whisper, creating distinction. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one line ("They had sought to refract a single truth into many, yet clung desperately...") reads as narrator summary rather than embodied thought. Diction remains consistent with the fantastical setting, and no filter-verb stacks appear in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present—memory and tactile focus—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully anchored in crisis state: "quilting memories together," "suturing the marble's fractured history." The prose texture is distinct and voice-motivated most of the time, yet phrases like "asserting that damage was merely prelude to revelation" read more essayistic than lived thought. Under peak pressure (gear snapping, acid rising), syntax compresses effectively. No dialogue present, so those bullets do not apply. Free indirect style is generally clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and appropriately elegiac in register. Psychic distance modulates well (close during the shell placement, wider during the cave walk). Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices light, color, geological time—but some diction ("intimately aloof," "temporary eternity") feels slightly elevated beyond his lived interiority, creating minor register drift. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice is coherent but occasionally lapses into workshop phrasing ("the weight of absolution") that abstracts rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited holds throughout; psychic distance remains stable. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices jasmine, condensation, lamp mechanics). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("screaming tenderness of withheld breath," "frequencies too subtle for human ears") that sits uneasily with the assistant keeper's voice under stress. No dialogue on the page to assess. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts at the climax, longer syntactic arcs in reflection), but the final paragraph's stacked metaphors ("violence of his own quiet," "tenderness, when absolute and unafraid, screams louder") feel authorial rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: diction is elevated but character-specific ("liminal tower," "meridian where the girl's voice had last bounced off satellites"), and the prose reflects the navigator's technical/geographic lexicon. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are present ("archipelago of absences," "topographical map of every goodbye") and taught early, remaining legible at closure. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-rooted ("negative spaces," "inverse migration") in a way that slightly dilutes voice particularity. Filter verbs are minimal. The rhythmic control under pressure is strong, with syntax tightening as understanding crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Maren's perceptual signature clear: she notices soil acidity, peat, root balls, and fungal networks through a mycologist's lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("waxed linen," "false truffle," "bell of a broken flask"), and psychic distance modulates appropriately—close during the ritual, pulling back slightly for the final reflective image. The prose shows Maren's mind under pressure. However, some elevated phrasing ("fractured sanctuary," "fortress of silence against the viral empathy") drifts toward lyric register in a way that feels slightly imposed rather than emerging from her practical, scientific baseline voice, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("Each future visitor would add") shifts from immediate perception to abstract projection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance modulating purposefully (close during memory influx, pulling back for the investigation). Diction is controlled and character-particular: "calcifying into ritual," "tides ground stone into sand," "mist curled around the pylons in softly persistent waves." No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what Maren can plausibly infer from the borrowed memories. Minor deduction: some phrasing ("foundational," "circuit between past and present") leans toward elevated abstraction that sits at the edge of the established voice's lexicon, though it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Arthur's perceptual signature (authenticator's eye, trained gut, atlas auctions) filters description consistently. Diction fits the cartographer's register ("empirically intuitive," "forged coastlines," "watermarks"). Thomas's deathbed line is brief and voice-distinct. However, elevated phrasing in high-pressure moments ("empirically intuitive," "crucible of consequence," "transmuted into responsibility") drifts above Arthur's established idiom. Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling," "recalling") cluster in mid-story without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout, filtered through Elara's perspective. Voice texture is consistent—elevated, lyric register with embedded metaphor ("swallowed stone," "lacy menace")—but the prose occasionally drifts into declarative summary ("In that shared breath, the mystery unraveled itself") that abstracts what could be shown. Mara's dialogue ("You came," "The dreams were never yours alone") feels functional rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable, though the final paragraph's cosmic overview ("the summer that would never end") pulls back from Elara's immediate experience without clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in close third focused on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture through compressed metaphoric diction ("scientifically romantic," "logarithmic spiral catching the failing light like a question mark") that remains legible despite density. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Elara's way of noticing reads as authorial lyricism rather than an alchemist's occupational or personal filter. The single line of dialogue from Mira ("I never told you...") and Elara's response lack subtext or goal pursuit, functioning as setup for the ritual rather than interpersonal negotiation. Register holds steady but diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("revalued the raw photons by returning them differently") that tests the bounds of in-scene interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct, lyric texture ("lucid dream chronicler," "ouroboros," "surly bonds of sequence"). Psychic distance is controlled, and diction remains character-particular. However, elevated register in peak beats ("jaded wonder suffused him," "shimmering constellation of being") occasionally clashes with embodied immediacy, and the metaphorical ascent lacks concrete anchor in present perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable and filtered through Mara's particular sensory lens; her way of noticing (rust patterns, stress fractures, hand trembles) is character-specific. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression. Some diction leans elevated ("occluded," "amniotic fluid," "liminal space") in ways that occasionally drift from a repairer's working idiom, though the voice remains coherent. The repeated phrase structures ("reading between the lines," "through occluded views," "trembling calm") create pattern but risk template cadence in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Elara's scholarly-then-ritual mindset. Diction reflects her background ("budding rune scholar," "theoretical manuscripts," "narrative potential") and modulates under stress without breaking register. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices the quill's "worn soft" tip, the "bruised purple light," the "saturated hush." No head-hopping. However, several phrases approach ornamental density without advancing pressure: "liminal, precarious moment" and "profound lightness" lean literary rather than character-specific under duress. The crow quill receives repetitive full naming ("crow quill trimmed tip" x3) that reads more like template reinforcement than organic reference.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara, with narrative distance tightening under pressure (micro-setting detail narrows to the perfume bottle vibrating, the spirit's form sharpening). Voice is distinct and consistent: "trafficked in both ink and ectoplasm," "copper wire" metaphors, "ethereal grit." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with the spirit's static-translated cello strings and ventilation-whisper creating subtext. One register slip: "weaving meaning like copper wire, because direct speech lacked the voltage necessary for miracles" reads slightly over-elevated for the moment's urgency, though it fits her metaphor-driven character. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates intentionally at the apology beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with elevated, lyric register. The voice is distinct—recursive syntax, precise coinages ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush")—but the diction stays uniformly elevated without modulation under stress or POV-specific perceptual bias. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (spiral imagery, paradoxical phrasing) are taught early and sustained through closure. Free indirect access to the protagonist's understanding is clean, though interiority leans toward exposition of the concept rather than embodied perception. The phrase "wanderingly exact" recurs as a voice marker but becomes a template tic when applied to "logic," "definitions," and "word" across multiple paragraphs without fresh contextual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent philosophical register with purposeful compression and lyric rhythm ("sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight"). POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature (noticing edges, boundaries, resistance) is character-specific. However, some diction ("tyranny of tomorrow," "collapsed into memory") edges toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds what the shepherd would formulate mid-task. The countdown structure provides deliberate pacing that supports the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature is filtered through her academic lens ("Bayesian inference," "statistical likelihoods"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("verdant poetry," "lucid contradiction demanding rigor and surrender") that, while voice-motivated by her profession, can feel more essayistic than embodied under pressure. Rhythmic control is present but repetitive sentence stems ("She understood," "She traced," "She remembered") create minor template cadence. The prose reflects her mind but does not degrade syntax or perception under stress, missing an opportunity for dynamic modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: elevated, rhythmic diction ("melodically haunted," "architecture of hello," "tapestry of almost-connections") coheres with the booth-as-liminal-space premise and Mara's philosophical stance. Psychic distance is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. The dialogue fragments—Mara's whispered instructions—carry subtext and goal pursuit, teaching renunciation through aphorism. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices disc rotations, streetlamp pitch shifts, water rhythms, framing sensory input through her operator role. However, under peak emotional pressure (the teenager's mention of pills and wanting to quit), the narration remains at the same lyric register without compression, urgency shift, or embodied reaction from Mara, softening the voice's responsiveness to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: diction choices ("mnemonic," "sedimented," "proximate causes") fit an archivist's perceptual signature, and syntax modulates between long reflective rhythms and shorter present anchors. Purposeful compression ("not magic but physics through proximate causes") and metaphor density are pattern-taught and mostly legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-motivated. However, some elevated register choices ("steeping the atmosphere," "forgiving obscurity of time") drift slightly above immediate perception under pressure, and a few near-repetitions in the final third ("gently, thoroughly" recurs without reweighting) suggest minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—"desperately jocular," precise courtesy—colors narration distinctly, and diction (ledgers, supply manifests, "polite anarchy") fits his logistician lens. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the child's "You're not alone either, mister" advances plot and subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the child's arrival. Minor filter-verb density ("he believed," "he understood") in expository beats slightly dulls immediacy but does not flatten voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Elara "absorbs," "feels rather than heard," experiences vibrations as semantic units. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close sensory immersion and slightly elevated reflection. Diction stays consistent with a lyric, metaphor-dense register appropriate to a character who charts "unmapped countries of the heart." The prose texture is distinct and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb abuse. The narrative certainty matches what a blind character could know through touch and vibration, maintaining POV modesty throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a consistent elevated register. However, diction drifts into abstract literary phrasing under pressure ("confidently uncertain," "deliberate imprecision," "contingent relationships of might-have-been timelines") that reads more like thematic annotation than Elara's lived perceptual signature. Syntax is rhythmic but uniform—many sentences follow a declarative subject-verb-metaphor pattern without modulation. No dialogue present. The ghost-images of colleagues appear without clear focalization rules (are they real, hallucination, or metaphor?), creating minor distance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature is specific: he sees silence as geometry, frames absence, and perceives Mara's whispers as warmth and vibration rather than sound. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when his emotion swells ("joyful sorrow bloom"). However, two slips touch high-pressure beats: "quietly charismatic even in solitude, his presence commanding the night" is external narration that Elias cannot plausibly self-assess, and "the profound translation of emptiness into meaning" elevates register beyond his established interior voice. Diction otherwise suits an aging musician; the camera/conducting metaphors feel earned by his background.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive," "surgical precision"), but it remains static across beats and reads as authorial rather than filtered through Maya's immediate perceptual state under pressure. Psychic distance is wide and declarative; we are told about her trembling fingers and tears without inhabiting the sensory particulars of soot, charcoal dust, or the weight of the tapestry fragment in her grip. No dialogue appears. The phrase "analytically intuitive" recurs as a label without dramatizing the perceptual signature it names.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization through Kael's grief-saturated perception. Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-appropriate for the speculative premise ("quantum foam," "auric lagoon," "bioluminescent algae"). Perceptual signature is distinct: he experiences sound as touch ("traveled up his arms like electricity"), perceives the lagoon through their shared history. Register occasionally drifts into exposition mode ("The doctors believed they were mapping grief, cataloging the entangled memories") where summary replaces scene pressure, and the phrase "auroral sorrow of the garden wrapped around him like a blanket made of northern lights" stacks metaphors in a way that slightly blurs immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited remains stable with close attachment to Kael's perceptual signature: selective auditory focus, grease-pencil precision, embodied memory. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You're early," "The storm amplifies everything"). Voss and Kael's exchanges carry subtext (challenge, acknowledgment) without over-explanation. Diction is controlled—"calculated spontaneity," "whisper made physical"—and voice-motivated. Minor distance wobble: "phosphorescent paint marking emergency exits" reads slightly tour-guide when urgency is high. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve beats.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the prose favors lyric compression, patterned diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension"), and a consistent elevated register. POV is stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, the voice remains decorative rather than pressurized—diction does not modulate with urgency because no urgency exists. Purposeful repetition ("spiralingly calm," "half-spoken secret") is taught early but does not evolve or charge the closure beat with new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—elevated diction, patterned syntax ("the father's unvoiced fear...the librarian's silent grief...the children's wordless panic")—that is consistent and voice-motivated. However, under peak pressure (the grotto climax), the narration does not compress or shift rhythm; it maintains the same ornate register throughout, which flattens the sense of urgency. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping, but the uniformly poetic register risks becoming a single-note voice that does not modulate with scene stakes, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elara with a distinct perceptual signature (water as language she "pretended not to speak"). The elevated register ("liminal world," "combative tenderness," "barometric pressure of her soul") is consistent and voice-motivated but occasionally strains credibility for a dock worker's interior lexicon, particularly under peak stress. Mako's dialogue is functional but brief; no sustained voice distinction test. Free indirect style is clean, though the diction reaches for lyric effect that sometimes distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited, stable distance on Elias with a brief clean shift to the woman's interiority ("eyes that had forgotten how to focus," her exhale). His voice is distinct: theatrical ("the vessel awaits its sacramental filling"), blank-faced performativity, and perceptual signature (noticing the wood's "resistance of grain," the woman's cracked voice). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("Do you have room?" / stage-whispered offer). The prose modulates from operatic ("precipice of creation") to quieter image-work ("dusted with the memory of purple") without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he was offering") are voice-motivated and minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with visceral immediacy: "aesthetically driven," "metamorphic language," "liminal space where language touches the divine" read as thematic scaffolding rather than Elara's interior lexicon under pressure. Sentence rhythm is uniform—most sentences extend to 20+ words with stacked subordinate clauses. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic; her noticing (blue tiles, amber light, subsonic hum) could belong to any observer.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV on Elara is stable, with perceptual signature rooted in her colorblindness: "light grey to dark," "charcoal and pearl." Marin's single line of dialogue—"Some things must awaken through exchange"—reads natural and charges the barter. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "botanical grammar" and "innocently cunning" lean slightly elevated. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately when Elara realizes her error. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (trained eye for light refraction, distrust of algorithmic order). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("propels her understanding forward," "collective music") that feels less character-specific and more authorial during peak beats. The voice is controlled and coherent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence structures remain uniform even as stakes rise, flattening the sense of urgency at the strike and awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited anchored to Elara, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register ("curtains of intention," "subdued ardor"). However, the diction often drifts into elevated philosophical abstraction ("architecture of truth," "coordinates of loss") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse; the young man's two lines are functional but carry little subtext or goal. The perceptual signature is poetic but not selective in character-specific ways—Elara notices symbols and metaphors rather than lived details. Psychic distance remains consistent but does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct texture—"liquid mercury tracing unpredictable algorithms," "metastasized into collective delusion"—that blends technical and arcane registers convincingly. Elias's brief dialogue is goal-driven and advances plot. Under peak pressure (Mara's confession and demonstration), diction stays consistent and voice doesn't flatten. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the perceptual signature (cartomancer's measuring eye) remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("saffron-veil historian," "bronze prism pagoda," "anguished joy") with controlled elevation that matches the archival setting and the historian's scholarly POV. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Diction is purposefully heightened ("mathematical tyranny," "scribble of defiance") and consistent. However, repetitive sentence stems appear in the climactic dance sequence ("She had discovered," "She had what she came for," "She left"), and the register occasionally tips into abstraction ("atoms of nostalgia swarmed") that dilutes immediacy during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate," "blooming library"—but the register occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing that feels writerly rather than rooted in Elara's professional idiom under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (she notices light transitions and shadow autonomy) but vocabulary remains uniform across calm observation and peak realization, missing the syntactic or rhythmic modulation that would show her mind under stress. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filters (wildlife handler's attention to injury, color, habitat) are consistent and character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated: "interrogating every memory," "fractured integrity demanding attention," "shimmering stillness of a new beginning." These phrases read more like authorial summarization than Elara's embodied perception under pressure. Syntax varies purposefully and the prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, but the recurring use of abstract psychological terms ("willful blindness," "self-deception," "complicity") in interiority flattens the voice at peak reflective beats. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The final paragraph's rhythm and image control are strong, but the preceding material shows mild register inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature (reading rings, listening to plants, tracing surgical lines) is consistent and specific. Diction is elevated and lyric ("consciousness seeping back like water through cracked limestone," "the meteor hush of early morning") and fits the contemplative register. However, at peak pressure—descending the tunnel, discovering his sister—the prose remains uniform in rhythm and density without modulation, and abstract phrases ("the silence after the meteor's fall," "alphabets, finally legible") replace embodied perception. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("understood," "knew") are frequent but voice-motivated; psychic distance stays controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara's spatial imagination. The prose carries consistent lyric compression ("celluloid teeth biting softly," "hushed thunder") and purposeful metaphoric density. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for moment-to-moment perception: "climate-controlled vault," "geometry of redemption," "atmospheric weight of every unexpressed tenderness." Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice tilts toward authorial poeticism rather than character-specific texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: Elara's focus on celestial coordinates, unspoken words, and the sextant's warmth. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shadowed rapture," "topography of imprisoned imagination") that sits at the edge of the narrator's lexicon but remains legible. No head-hopping. Compression and metaphor density are high throughout; the pattern is taught early and holds, though peak beats risk figurative overload without line-level payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct poetic register ("white hardness of duty," "breathing of a sleeping giant"). Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the lyric-accumulative mode. No dialogue. Purposeful compression ("occasionally everywhere") is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is dreamless and abstract, prioritizing metaphor over concrete sensation. Under peak pressure (the archive opening), syntax remains ornate rather than fracturing, which slightly undercuts embodied stress but fits the meditative tone. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited throughout, with perceptual signature consistent to Kael's philosopher lens: "hum of insight," "acoustic signature," "probable miracles." The diction—"translocation," "harmonic resonance," "photosynthetic whispers"—is voice-motivated and coherent. The dialogue between Kael and the stranger is functional and goal-driven ("I am pruning dead philosophy" carries subtext of competing philosophies). Minor register elevation in peak beats ("cognitive wilderness," "acceptance of probable miracles") stays within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person close POV maintains stable distance and filters the surreal journey through Mara's specific anxieties and sensory experience. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices Atlas's breathing, the leash's "empty nylon cord," tactile anchors like the star stamp's bite and warmth. However, the prose occasionally shifts into elevated, nearly omniscient register ("the hour when the world holds its breath," "the patience of centuries") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially during high-pressure moments when diction should compress. The guides remain externally observed without head-hopping, and Mara's internal voice stays coherent, but the lyricism sometimes exceeds her established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and the perceptual signature is strong: "seraphically mundane grace," "breath on a winter window," sensory attention filtered through a mute's heightened observation. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent throughout. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "systematic erasure of melody itself" and "dangerous vulnerability of song" where academic elevation slightly exceeds the bellhop's embodied idiom under stress, but the effect remains largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the titan with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("the pause of shifting constellations," "the weight of epochs") that is consistent but risks liturgical distance—diction often abstracts rather than embodying the titan's perceptual signature. The pretender's dialogue ("I have solved your riddles, little librarian") is serviceable but generic villain-speak without subtext or distinct idiom. The titan's single line of dialogue ("You were never king...") is declarative summary rather than goal-driven action. Filter verbs are sparse, but the narration relies on passive constructions ("was spoken," "began their graceful collapse") that dull immediacy in peak beats. Perceptual signature is weak; the titan's way of noticing does not feel character-specific or selective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices chemical signatures, tide rhythm, console vibration—an observer's lens. Diction ("zooxanthellae," "fossil economy," "institutional knowledge") fits her scientific background without academic bloat. No dialogue; interior voice is consistent and purposeful. The prose modulates with pressure: fast staccato tapping during cross-reference, stillness at revelation, slower cadence at closure. Purposeful compression ("turning from rainbow to bone in the span of a month") and reflection interleaved with present micro-choices (slotting drives, folding the page) maintain voice control under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices tactile and auditory detail (cold metal, subsonic resonance, teeth vibration) over visual spectacle. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue present. Minor register drift into elevated phrasing ("thunderous serenity that filled the bay without shattering the quiet") at peak beats, but the effect supports the mystical tone. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices plant voices, mineral deposits, cipher games. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with botanical and insurgent idiom ("insurgent's courage," "roots against stone"). Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the unsealing crescendo. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with embodied urgency: "To unseal it required both the mathematical precision of the kite's code and the biological permission of the plant collective" reads expository in a high-pressure beat. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance remains stable in close third with consistent access to Elias's interior processing. Diction occasionally shifts into clinical register ("somatic marker," "topography of survival," "calcification") that, while voice-motivated by his marine biology background, reads slightly elevated during emotional peaks. Perceptual signature is strong—he notices light filtering through needles, synchronous primrose opening, details reflecting his botanical focus. Syntax modulates effectively from longer contemplative rhythms to shorter beats during the freeze. Filter verbs ("he understood," "he noticed") appear but remain controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: artist idiom ("palette," "irises," "cartographer"), metaphor density. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from crisis urgency to conceptual poise. The prose sustains texture under pressure without head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("crestfallen," "bioluminescent," "luminescent ache") but remains voice-consistent; no therapy-speak intrusions. Minor register drift in peak beats ("catastrophic knots," "architecture of her perception") nudges below 8-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register and perceptual signature ("pink eyes tracing the horizon," "glacial slowness"). Diction remains controlled and purposeful, though at peak beats the prose leans into abstract metaphor ("distributed through the moment," "frequency of someone who chose to step outside the river of seconds") rather than concrete imagery. No dialogue to assess. The voice is distinct and voice-motivated, but the consistent high register during the dissolution sequence obscures rather than sharpens the physical reality of what is happening.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV is stable, and perceptual signature (archivist's lens on "frozen memories," "cathedral-sized vault") is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak moments ("contraband truths," "fever of revelation," "digital ghosts") that feel authorial rather than Mara's lived lexicon after seventeen years in isolation. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose at closure leans expository ("she had chosen to melt one") rather than immediate. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but voice under pressure loses specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices fractured light timing, sandbag notes, barometric shifts. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze"). No head-hopping. The prose registers climb occasionally into elevated metaphor ("continuity through chaos, thread by thread"), but the effect remains legible and anchored in Maya's sensory attention. Brief compression under the dome-shudder beat is acceptable. One minor slip: "engraved quiet" feels prompt-adjacent and slightly external to Maya's natural lexicon, but it does not break distance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "voicing silence," "transliterate," "dialect of metal," and "sleepwalking constellations" establish Kael's idiom. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with immediacy ("acoustic flowers folding into buds," "repository of the goddess's final exhalation") and some figurative vehicles mixed mid-beat without paying off (fear rendered into etchings, then topography, then braille dialect within two lines). No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated diction, complex syntax, metaphoric density ("orbits of regret that circled back to destroy his heirs"). POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into expository philosophy ("proving that some orbits could be escaped if one simply stopped calculating around the wrong center") that feels more thesis than character perception. The "solemn playfulness" tone modulates appropriately across the night's work, but a few phrases ("economic impossibility that somehow felt mathematically sound") lean toward authorial summary rather than Eleanor's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is consistent and metaphorically dense ("frequency lost to the world," "temporal signature," "spectral tendrils"). However, register drifts into exposition at key moments: "those designed to interpret humanity's most primal language before syntax existed" and "the geological slowness of the fossil to the fleeting instant of birth and betrayal" read like authorial gloss rather than Elara's embodied thought under crisis pressure. The voice is coherent but not distinctive under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature tied to Mara's craft. Diction is purposeful and lyric but slips into elevated register during peak beats: "spontaneous organization," "reverent awe," "dialect of echoes" elevate beyond the POV's working texture. "Socially perceptive enough to recognize" is narratorial labeling rather than dramatized perception. Sentence rhythm varies and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks the textural grit needed for 9+ consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (retrocognitive layering, augmented-limb awareness, poetic register). Psychic distance stays controlled and voice modulates appropriately under emotional pressure. The elevated diction ("aberrant mercy," "tessera," "vitrified") is consistent and character-motivated, though some phrases trend abstract ("negative space," "catastrophe's mathematics") where concrete imagery would sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV through Julian is stable and well-controlled; his synesthetic perception colors every image ("flat gray notes," "golden threads," "amber and rust"). Diction is elevated and lyric-poetic ("shoulders curled like sheet music left in rain," "temporal density"), consistently voice-motivated and apt for a stage ghost. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the song, wider when describing Mara's vision). No dialogue present; all interaction occurs through spectral action and Mara's silent response. Minor: occasional filter verbs ("Julian understood despair; it tasted to him") are acceptable here but slightly dull immediacy, and phrases like "despair-addled mind" and "encore he had craved" veer toward summary rather than embodied perception under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on somatic markers, wider on thematic reflection). The single line of dialogue—"I don't believe in telepathy, but I believe in your pain"—carries subtext and goal pursuit, feeling voice-appropriate. Perceptual signature is present: Maya notices crystalline structures, neural pathways, and goosebumps in a body-as-instrument mode. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "somatic markers," "willowglass hope") that, while thematically motivated, sits uneasily with the affectionate, hands-on caretaker established in the opening. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "fierce, protective love" and "the geography of desperation" read as narratorial commentary rather than Maya's interior idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cathedral chambers," "cartography of feeling") but leans abstract when pressure should tighten. The heat-map "song" that translates thermal patterns is told rather than made specific through syntax or rhythm. Perceptual signature (thermal sensors, anti-grav hum) anchors Kael's professional lens early. However, the prose does not modulate under peak moments—"trembling hands" and "knowing" read at the same register as earlier exposition, flattening emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara, but psychic distance wobbles: "truth unravels" and "shared wisdom flowed" oscillate between her perceptual register and an elevated narratorial voice. Diction is lyric and consistent, yet the prose converges on a single elevated cadence ("harmonic of the canyon's original song," "unearthed silence of potential") that reads more like atmospheric assertion than character-specific perception. Elara's internal voice lacks idiosyncrasy—her way of noticing is poetic but generic, not shaped by seventeen years among resin vaults.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third limited on Elena; no head-hopping. Voice has textural ambition—"silver hush," "gauze," "skeletal pines"—but diction drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe," "prudently daring," "burned spy," "disavowal") that reads more literary than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Marcus's single exchange lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose modulates with scene stakes but the perceptual signature is not selective or biased in Elena-specific ways; it reads as omniscient-lite rather than filtered through her operational mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct meditative voice. Diction ("spindrift serenity," "gloom-hill," "percolate") is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond plausible focalizer lexicon during high-focus beats, creating minor register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—temperature, absence of birdsong, ambient cues—yet the prose sometimes narrates the coachman's method rather than enacting it ("his motivation clear: to distill complexity"). Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "recognized") cluster in the second half without voice-motivated justification, slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Kai's perceptual idiom: "sharp gentleness," "phototropic to kindness," "fractured timelines." The prose carries a distinct lyric-philosophical register with controlled rhythm ("precise as a blade, soft as ash"). Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The diction occasionally risks elevated abstraction ("entropy of the wasteland," "collective consciousness") that tests the boundary of Kai's plausible lexicon, but remains coherent within the contemplative voice. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is character-consistent (gardener's eye for petals, mechanic's daughter touching tools). Diction generally fits Mara's blue-collar background but occasionally drifts into elevated register: "wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability," "instilling the harbor with a vigilance." These phrases feel imposed rather than emerging from Mara's working-class idiom. Psychic distance shifts are intentional (close at key beats, reflective in transitions), though peak moments would benefit from tighter sensory immediacy. Free indirect thought is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature (Mira notices "frozen lightning," "photons against basalt") rooted in her librarian/scholar identity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection, wider during environmental sweep). Register occasionally elevates beyond POV's plausible lexicon ("subsonic resonance," "coherent beams," "mathematical precision") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Prose rhythm varies, though some passages lean toward purple ("brittle awakening crystallize within her...delicate frost forming on the window of understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent register of elevated diction: "vaulting other hearts' trembling confessions," "prismatic quiet," "inevitably whimsical." Psychic distance remains stable in third-close; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—Mara's "I never knew" and Elara's reply carry subtext. Minor weakness: the narration occasionally slips into summary omniscience ("She had learned that some nests are built…") that tells wisdom rather than showing Elara arriving at it through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout, with consistent perceptual signature: Elena traces charts, checks calculations, watches through the window. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("ethereal architecture," "metastatic spread," "quantum wavelengths") with technical vocabulary fitting her role. The prose modulates under pressure: short clauses during the climactic sequence, longer contemplative rhythms at the end. However, "entities that fed on discord" and "cosmic tricksters" toggle between registers slightly, and "shame" attributed to dispersing neighbors edges toward unwarranted certainty about collective internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices architectural geometry, pulse in stone, precise angles. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the gear-strike beat. Register occasionally drifts upward ("spatial mutiny," "tessellated floor," "mathematical intervention") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-filtered, especially during high-pressure moments. Diction like "prudently adventurous instinct" and "wistful rebellion" reads as commentary layered over her crisis rather than organic to her mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong diction ("geological wound," "lance the abscess of silence"). Perceptual signature is present: Elara's scientific method and neurological blindness filter her observations. Register occasionally inflates beyond immediate scene need ("taxonomy of contradictions," "penetration of emotional barriers"), though it remains mostly consistent with an educated investigator's internal voice. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. The prose modulates appropriately at the climax ("her breath shallow"), maintaining voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and rooted in Elara's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent, matching a scholarly librarian's register. However, the prose occasionally slips into exposition that explains rather than dramatizes ("This object had anchored Mara's burial at sea, a final indignity"). The meteorologist's single line of dialogue feels natural, but his sudden comprehension is told through narration rather than enacted. Psychic distance wavers between close interiority and detached summary, especially in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (bridge-song terminology, architectural metaphors). Elias's professional lens colors perception throughout. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("the glowing suspension between what was and what could be reconstructed," "negative space of potential"), which reads less like a traumatized musician's crisis thought and more like essayistic summary. No dialogue is present to evaluate, and focalization remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias filters setting through regret and parallel-seeking ("cartographer mapping regret," "geometry of repetition"). Diction is elevated yet consistent, matching a reflective protagonist. Rhythm modulates appropriately—longer sentences during contemplation, shorter beats at the closure decision. Minor register drift: "termsheets and equity" versus "dusky harmony" occasionally strains tonal cohesion, but the voice remains controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara, and the prose maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register throughout. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the shared burdens of civilizations long buried rising up to meet her in mathematical precision") that reads more like thematic assertion than Elara's embodied perception. The perceptual signature is present but generic—she notices stars, telegram, grief—without idiosyncratic bias that reveals how her seventeen years as a dream chronicler have shaped her way of seeing. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("The temple inscriptions were decoded at last: we survive not…") breaks the dramatized POV to deliver theme directly, lowering the score.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and purposeful, with a lyric, elevated register ("salt and sorrow," "moments trapped between heartbeats"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the druid's attention to thresholds and spirals. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("truths that slip sideways into shadow") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Under peak pressure (vortex tightening, ice cracking), syntax remains uniform and elevated without compression or degradation to reflect stress.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV (Elara) is stable. Voice leans ornate and uniform: "shadows pooled like ink," "bark having fused with her skin," "anxious elation lifting them like wings." Dialogue is sparse but functional; Kael's line "I heed the warning in your eyes" reads archaic and convergent with the narrative register. Psychic distance is consistent but filter-heavy ("She was," "they had not spoken"). Perceptual signature is generic fantasy-elevated rather than character-particular; no diction shift under stress. The prose maintains coherence but lacks rhythmic modulation or distinct interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias reads the orchard through grief's grammar, seeing "a future in the bifurcation of a root, a warning in the way a femur cracked." The prose texture is purposeful, rhythmic, and voice-specific ("warnings were merely punctuation in a language he refused to speak"). Two frictions lower the score: (1) elevated diction occasionally drifts from the focalizer's likely lexicon during high-pressure beats ("trammel," "inlaying," "benediction" cluster densely); (2) some figurative density in the opening third ("the grammar of grief demanded action," "economics of souls," "mathematics of a heart") risks over-writing, though the pattern coheres and pays off at closure where the language simplifies to embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Marcus filters setting through roadie/appraiser expertise ("OEM Fender-style wheat weave"), blending technical vocabulary with emotional echoes. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the kid's "Is it real?" carries weight. Diction remains consistent—metaphors drawn from music and amplification. Deduction: some constructions lean slightly elevated ("the mathematics of longing," "the long, gray frequency of the rest of his life") for a man in crisis, though voice-motivated enough to remain plausible. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's scholarly perspective. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("physics of transition demanded understanding death not as termination but as translation") that reads more like authorial thesis than embodied character thought under pressure. Psychic distance remains stable throughout. The perceptual signature (noticing microscopic cuneiform, reading surfaces as tablets) is character-specific, though the voice under peak stress stays uniformly articulate rather than compressing or fracturing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited to the librarian; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("titan-gear," "migrating identities," "smelt them into the permanent record"), though some phrases skirt abstraction ("essence," "luminescent fog," "captured amazement"). The prose maintains a distinct, formal texture appropriate to the mechanical narrator, and the voice modulates subtly with the tide and moon imagery. No dialogue is present; filter verbs ("communicated," "conveyed") are voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (mineral metaphors, architectural language, light-trap imagery). Diction remains elevated and purposeful throughout. However, register drift appears in peak beats: "dissolve the walls between hearts" and "one continuous beam of understanding" shift into abstract therapeutic idiom during the climactic ritual. The phrase "her silhouette multiplying across the geode walls like a constellation come to earth" is vivid but tonally at odds with Elara's grounded, technical vocabulary established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and closely aligned with Maya's perceptual signature: her chronicler's habit of cataloging and methodical observation colors every description. Diction is mostly consistent ("dangerous clarity," "raw solace"), though occasional phrases ("the particular rust scent of abandoned metal," "grief and relief braided together") feel slightly elevated beyond her immediate stress state. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the accordion scene. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the voice remains singular and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, matching a lyric-fabulist register. However, psychic distance remains uniform throughout; high-pressure moments (approaching the mother's volume, the six-hour deadline) do not modulate diction or rhythm. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was not merely recording," "had been her sole motivation") dull immediacy. The dreamer's perceptual signature—veil filtering spectra—appears once but does not recur to charge later beats. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong (provenance researcher's lens, plant-telepathy filtering). Diction is consistent and elevated but occasionally drifts into over-wrought lyricism ("spectral veins," "evaporating clarity," "hollow spaces where freedom had leaked out") that risks purple prose without full voice-motivation. No head-hopping. The plant-chorus moments ("sharp, green, photosynthetic terror," "chlorophyll and dread") are vivid but their register ("thermal shock," "collapsing cellular memories") sometimes feels more authorial than experiential. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (physics-aware, detail-oriented, reverent). Diction ("lucidly watchful," "radiant hush," "snowstorm of dying synapses") is elevated but character-apt for a technician-mystic. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Psychic distance holds. One brief strain: "the architecture of self rendered into mineral permanence" reads slightly expository mid-scene, but voice recovers immediately. Sentence rhythm modulates cleanly between contemplative passages and the active chip-pressing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited throughout, with Elias's perceptual signature (three-century memory, wine/vineyard metaphors) consistent. Diction is elevated and lyrical, fitting the contemplative voice, though some constructions ("kindly decisive, firm in their gentleness yet gentle in their firmness") verge on ornamental. No dialogue appears; the single-character focus maintains clean focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reflective (opening exposition) to immediate (digging, planting). The prose occasionally shifts into abstract register ("the scalloped edge of a larger pattern") that feels more authorial than character-bound, but the texture remains distinct and the voice does not collapse under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (interpreting chimes as tea leaves, professional attention to "protected vulnerability") is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("transmuted into temporary truths," "crystallized final moment") that sits uneasily with the maritime setting. The hollow mirror shard "singing" and chimes "spelling" meanings verge on symbolic convenience rather than lived perception. Filter verbs ("saw how the cartographer's crime was") appear in a reflective beat without harming distance control. Internal voice is coherent, though the texture sometimes reads more as crafted allegory than embodied thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-philosophical register with distinct perceptual signature: "silver milk," "sycamore hush," "green whisper that smelled of autumn and endings that were really beginnings." POV is stable and controlled. However, filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood," "he studied through") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The single tense slip ("he weaves truth carefully") near mid-story breaks consistency. Diction remains elevated throughout without modulation under stress, and the voice never shifts cadence as pressure should mount.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct textural voice—elevated, meditative, poetic. Distance is consistent, filtering perception through the skimmer's centuries-long contemplation. However, diction is often abstract and elevated beyond urgent embodiment: "historically reverent care," "pulse left wandering," "weathered resolve" read as stock poetic constructions rather than character-specific perceptual signature. Sentence openings show variety, but many clauses use similar participial or prepositional structures ("through centuries," "through the patterns," "in the canyon") creating a template cadence. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice is distinctive but not deeply individuated to this character's sensory particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices irregular glow, asymmetrical flourishes, warmth. Diction is elevated and controlled ("frost-rimed," "crystalline computation," "brilliant dimness") but consistent throughout; no unmotivated register shifts. The phrase "accommodating impossibilities" recurs with purpose, teaching the pattern. Rhythmic control is strong in the mist-walking sequence ("Each step demanded…"). No dialogue to judge. Minor filter-verb density ("feeling," "understanding") in reflective beats, but voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (pier-worker's eye for lamps, inherited librarian's focus). Diction is elevated and lyric ("meteor hush," "dust made of amethyst") which fits the tonal aim but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("chromatic resonance," "synesthetic harmonics") that edges beyond a lamplighter's natural lexicon. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well under emotional pressure in the descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices quantum echoes, temporal medium viscosity, phase shifts. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("stellar doubt," "distilled intention") that feels more authorial than character-bound, especially under pressure. The prose carries purpose-driven compression and the backwards-grammar conceit is taught early, but filter verbs ("watching how they settled") dull immediacy in key beats where more direct perception would sharpen focus.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and consistent. Perceptual signature is present (cosmic/cartographic lens: "dust motes...like microscopic galaxies," "geometry of love preserved") but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated register that edges past the reaper's plausible lexicon during peak beats: "the namelessness of his mourning, the way grief defied classification." Diction remains largely character-apt (reaper as death-servant turned mapmaker), and the final image modulates appropriately. Purposeful compression in the ritual sequence reads clean under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Elara's practical focus—drip intervals, bronze alignment, hydrospell mechanics. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, though phrases like "earnestly naive enough to believe" and "brittle devotion" occasionally lean expository. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present but could deepen under peak stress; the narration remains somewhat distanced during the bell strike.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct elevated register ("liminal hour," "archaeological patience," "turbid water") that fits a reflective warden but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing: "water against stone and the whisper of sediment settling into new configurations" front-loads lyricism before stakes are clear. Perceptual signature is strong—he notices stress fractures, clay, granite foundations. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("he recognized," "he understood") are acceptable and voice-motivated. One slip: "innocent people" editorializes in a way that breaks the POV's measured tone.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with Elara's scholarly background. However, diction drifts into generic poeticism ("breath held for centuries," "stardust," "currents of becoming") that could apply to any transformation narrative. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's noticing does not reflect her alchemical training in specific, idiosyncratic ways. The final paragraphs compress agency ("she had learned," "no longer merely") into summary rather than showing her perceptual shift through concrete observation. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is stable and tight. Perceptual signature is distinct: "midnight mathematics," stress points, drag coefficients, micro-fracture detection. Diction ("nocturnal arbor," "stratospheric wind," "sulfuric mist") matches her technical training without register drift. The brief dialogue from Kael ("You saw the pattern") is natural and goal-driven, advancing closure. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the revision, longer breath at rest). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: "her mind a hollow bell that had already cracked," "perception so stark it sliced through pretense." Psychic distance is stable and the narrator's certainty matches what Maya can plausibly know. Dialogue with the brain ("You cannot exist") and the brain's conceptual "response" walk the line between dramatization and assertion but remain voice-consistent. Minor register drift: phrases like "architecture of her own dissolving consciousness" and "the tyranny of the singular" elevate diction slightly beyond the established texture, though not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV on Elias is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees his family's grief crystallizing, hears the echo chamber doubling sound. Psychic distance is controlled. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("macerate," "stalactites," "mournfully eager") that feels authorial rather than character-particular, especially given Elias's backstory as a leaf-blower conductor. The prose lacks the rough-edged or blue-collar texture one might expect from his voice. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinctive (hybrid beast/human, dimensionally inflected diction). The prose carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("foggy lucidity," "psychic architecture," "breathing membranes rather than walls") that suits the narrator's otherworldly stance. However, under peak moments—the pendant's appearance, the decision to stay—diction remains uniformly elevated without the compression or rhythm shift that would mark emotional pressure. No dialogue is present. The voice is coherent and purposeful, but does not modulate with stakes, reading more like constant meditation than lived experience under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—Marcus reads materials through their history and potential—and the diction ("stoically sensitive," "cryptic alphabet," "dangerous, exhilarating weight") establishes a formal, elevated register. However, the voice occasionally slips into corporate-academic phrasing ("successive approximation," "molecular architecture," "narrative of failure") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, alternating between long reflective periods and shorter action beats, though the elevated register remains uniform even under peak stress where compression might be expected.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and often specific ("guy wires humming a low modal drone," "quantum foam of space time"), but several phrases drift into elevated register that clashes with moment-to-moment perception: "serenely electric" repeated twice, "fantasy practicality" as a label rather than enacted stance, "the wisdom of emptiness" at closure. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("death scream…twelve billion years ago, preserved in the quantum foam") is legible and voice-motivated. Filter verbs are sparse. Perceptual signature is professional-technical but lacks idiosyncratic bias—Elara notices like a generalized scientist rather than a singular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic ("reality unspooled like loose rope," "memory floated like sediment") rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register incongruent with a working deckhand ("interconnected patterns," "spectral grotto," "convergent probabilities"). The child's dialogue is absent, a missed opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure—Elias's calm competence never fractures into compressed syntax or sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic, consistent with the fever-dream premise, though it occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical register ("rational enchantment demanded release") that undercuts embodied perception. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices architectural impossibilities and textural qualities—but the voice sometimes sacrifices immediacy for lyric abstraction. Purposeful compression and patterned vocabulary ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary") are taught early and sustained, fitting the experimental mode.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third; psychic distance and focalization are clean. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's in-scene naturalness: "somber marvel that had settled over all their lives" and "transcend their submarine tomb" read more literary than embodied perception. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly individuated—the way Mara notices could belong to any technically educated observer. Dialogue, when present, is functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom; the student's line is indistinguishable from Mara's cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elena's perceptual signature (e.g., "reeling hush," "radioactive with consequence") is distinct and voice-consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider atmospheric framing. Thomas's single line of dialogue ("It's safe now") is attributed to Elena in the text, creating brief confusion. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping; the narrative certainty about Mrs. Gable's motives ("laid this trap not for justice, but for rescue") exceeds what Elena can know on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices ionic signatures, quantum echoes, phase transitions through her professional and neurotic lens. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ionic signatures of drowned voices," "quantum echoes trapped in silica") that, while voice-motivated for a specialist, edges toward ornamental density in peak beats. No dialogue present. The prose reflects her state, but some filter verbs ("She moved," "She felt") slightly dull immediacy where direct perception would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature (heartbeat enumeration, porcelain pressure, warmth on ink). Diction is elevated and dense throughout—"womb of ice and refracted light," "dendritic patterns," "administrative death"—which risks monotony but remains internally consistent. Register strain appears in phrases like "MacGyvered from old telescope parts," which jars against the otherwise heightened prose. No dialogue present. The final-paragraph shift to "simply living" feels slightly over-articulated but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: professional-acoustic bias filters setting detail (porous texture, calcium walls, tonal frequencies). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though elevated register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("dissolution of syntax," "recursive depths") without loss of clarity. No dialogue; narration stays within the storyteller's plausible lexicon. Psychic distance is steady, and the prose reflects the focalizer's expertise without Wikipedia-voice intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elena with no head-hopping. However, the voice drifts into elevated register ("entropy itself," "luminous possibility," "infinite descent") that clashes with undercover researcher interiority during peak metamorphosis. Diction such as "gravitationally playful" and "harmony untamed" repeats as poetic labels without Elena's perceptual signature filtering them into her thought process. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose reads as externally poetic rather than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (musician's vocabulary: "plucked string," "cadence," "rhythm") remains consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's lexicon mid-crisis: "insurgent of beauty," "tyranny of straight lines," "cognitive smoothness" (wait—"cognitive" doesn't appear, but similar abstractions do). Filter verbs ("feeling her pulse," "watching the geometry dissolve") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marek; psychic distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("cobalt arcade," "brittle hush," "propeller wash," "smuggling network of automated eyes"), which fits the textural lens but risks register mismatch—would a mailman in a war zone narrate his world this way? Perceptual signature is present (mapping drone corridors, tracing empty slots), and the prose modulates with emotional intensity (urgency during the three-minute window). Some filter verbs ("understood," "knew") are acceptable for voice, though "respectfully rebellious in his refusal" and "understood that to foster connection" edge toward exposition rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices brass gears, sanded oak, scrollwork—craftsman's details. Voice modulates from ruin-walk to lyric wonder in the greenhouse without head-hopping. However, reflection dominates many beats ("understanding now that silence had never been his prison"), and some sentences lean into elevated, poetic register ("symphony in stillness") that occasionally floats above embodied perception. Filter verbs ("He realized," "He understood") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; diction ("Atheneum of Quantum Verses," "negative-curvature bookshelf") commits to an elevated, concept-heavy register that fits Elena's mathematical lens. Perceptual signature is consistent (physics-inflected metaphors, geometric observations). However, the voice becomes repetitive in syntactic structure (long noun-chains, stacked prepositional phrases) and the prose leans abstract rather than embodying Elena's state under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric register ("suspended moment before dawn claims the dark," "turning underwater"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "felt") appear frequently without voice justification. Perceptual signature is clear—Elara notices light, color, and metaphor—but psychic distance remains static across beats; no modulation between reflection and action pressure. The prose has distinct texture, but the elevated register risks distancing the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is evident, though some constructions ("the particular silence between heartbeats that only those who had lost something essential could decode") border on over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Vey with a consistent elevated register ("unassumingly bold," "enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility"), but diction often drifts into lyric abstraction that distances the reader from immediate sensory anchors. Perceptual signature is present—mechanisms "breathed rather than turned," hair "humming with a frequency"—yet syntactic patterns recur (paired adjectives, "X rather than Y" constructions) and the voice reads more as narrative consensus than Vey's particular idiom under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: the diction ("cathedral of decay," "votive offerings to a drowned god") feels purposeful and controlled. POV distance is stable; Elena's perceptual signature (folklorist's eye for pattern,chronically curious ache) colors the narration throughout. The single line of dialogue at the end ("You studied the stars") feels earned and goal-driven, carrying subtext of recognition and lost time. Psychic distance tightens naturally at the peak beat. The register occasionally elevates ("chronically curious ache," "mycelium") but remains within Elena's plausible lexicon as a hands-on academic.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent perceptual signature: dust, brass, cold glass, geometry of tea leaves. Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext ("You don't want to face me? Good. Fear is the first lesson."). Minor rhythm issue: "walked backwards when nervous, and she did so now" feels scaffolded rather than immediate. Psychic distance narrows cleanly at peak beats. The phrase "combative tenderness of a mother bird pushing her young from the nest" leans toward explanatory register but recovers through subsequent dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian, but perceptual signature is generic; elevated diction ("upon the hush of budding hope," "the silence between heartbeats") pervades without character-specific idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the prose occasionally drifts into lyric register that reads as imposed rather than earned by Elian's interiority. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was no ordinary morning," "had grown thin") dull immediacy in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "interlaced hush," "accumulated silence," and starlight refracted into unnamed colors. Diction ("exhume the twelfth ghost," "lucid unrest," "absolute stillness") is controlled and purposeful, creating a consistent textural voice. The whispered confession to the net maintains psychic distance without head-hopping. Some elevated phrasing ("letting them settle like sediment rather than whirl in eternal turbulence") risks register drift, but the voice remains coherent under pressure and the final image holds steady rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("energized her senses") to wider observational framing. Diction fits a scholarly restorer: "errors of ink and errors of truth," "fibers had been cut rather than ripped," "subsidence." Syntax reflects her methodical mind with balanced, clause-rich constructions. Compression in late beats ("water dripped...shielded openness") shifts cadence effectively. Minor: a few constructions read slightly elevated for peak moments ("those who feared persecution," "complacent in their guardianship"), and "shielded openness" as descriptor feels abstract rather than sensory-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: analytic, quietly lyrical, with professional vocabulary ("rebreather hissed rhythmically," "hydrodynamics and acoustic properties") that never breaks character. POV remains stable in third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. The captain's quoted transmission shifts register appropriately as a recovered voice from 1939. Perceptual signature is strong—Julian notices "the way light refracted," "wave equations," "surface tension and memory"—filtering everything through his scientific-philosophical lens. Minor density concern: occasional reaches toward elevated diction ("elegiac library," "waterlogged cathedral") that slightly exceed the established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person POV is stable; perceptual signature is ornate and consistent ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"). Psychic distance remains close throughout. However, the prose tilts toward decorative lyricism with phrases like "fracture of silence," "mechanical sorrow," "blooming across stones" that read more as atmospheric color than character-specific perception. Diction is elevated and poetic but somewhat uniform across emotional beats, missing modulation under peak pressure. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds tightly to Elara's perception; no head-hopping. Diction carries distinct texture: "brass cage shuddered," "cables singing," "cathedral of suspended water and ambition," "cartographer of dualities." Perceptual signature is clear—she notices emotional architecture (diary's "anguish" versus "transcendence") more than physical mechanics. Distance modulates appropriately: closer during cipher work, wider for the icebound spire's indifference. Minor density concern: occasional elevated register ("troposphere," "stratospheric space") fits the setting but edges toward ornament in a few descriptive beats without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose establishes a lyric, meditative register consistent with Elara's voice. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("curator of absences," "spooled wholeness," "negative space") that reads as authorial rather than character-lived idiom under crisis. Free indirect style is clean, but the perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than meteorologist-particular. Under peak stress (cable snapped, isolated at altitude), the syntax remains ornate and philosophical instead of compressing or fragmenting, which undercuts embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters consistently through Elara's hyper-tactile perception: "seeing not wood but constellations of texture," "detectable only by her hyper-sensitive fingertips." Diction is controlled and voice-distinct ("the hush before destruction when even the wind holds its breath"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during high-pressure beats (climbing, painting under deadline). However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("prophetic mirror suspended in pigment," "fractally precise, eternal in the limits of her art") that feels more authorial than character-particular. The foreman's whistle and engines roar remain external, appropriately filtered through vibration and sound rather than direct sight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices through a cartographic lens (brass railing, charcoal waves, spectral residue, celestial coordinates). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with occasional elevated turns ("hypnotic undulations," "ghost footprints," "stranded luminance") that match the archival, scholarly register. However, some constructions feel slightly overcrafted ("a habit born of sociable isolation that made the silence bearable without requiring the pretense of human company") and rhythmic monotony emerges in longer sentences with parallel participial phrases. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains stable; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elara as focalizer throughout. Narrative distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature is consistent (she notices celestial mechanisms, groaning shelves, the cadence of gears). However, diction drifts into elevated lyricism ("hauntingly bright," "liquid silk," "silver pinions arranged in a pattern that resembled a frozen dance") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a village locksmith. Filter verbs ("She saw," "She recognized," "She realized") appear frequently but fit the reflective tone. No head-hopping. The voice modulates appropriately through beats, though it lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would make Elara's interior unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice maintains a consistent register—lyric, SF-pastoral—and Mara's perceptual signature (notice of frost, chalk shimmer, lantern light) remains stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("brambled hope of survival," "nebula of respite") that feels imposed rather than character-native. The council dialogue is summarized rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but abstract: Elara notices "nested patterns," "quantum strings," "gossamer chains"—register elevates into cosmic-philosophical diction that reads more authorial than character-particular. Internal voice lacks sentence-level distinctness; many lines could belong to an omniscient narrator. Psychic distance wavers between intimate ("her trembling hands") and detached cosmic narration ("the mechanism groaned"). No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression is evident but the high register flattens urgency in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a distinct perceptual signature: "offhandedly exact," "welding gloves," "muttered complaint." The phrase "graceless beauty" appears twice, threading tone through narration. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminesce," "coherent map") that sits uneasily against her practical, grudging voice. No dialogue; interior access is controlled. Psychic distance modulates appropriately at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV third-limited holds clean throughout with consistent psychic distance. Diction matches Elena's scientific expertise without Wikipedia intrusion: "long-chain polymers cross-linked," "monomers into functional materials," "molecular vibrations" read as character-particular vocabulary. Perceptual signature is strong—she sees stress fractures in polymer networks during sleepless nights, tracks surface tension, recognizes chitin structure. The one line of dialogue ("I hear it now") feels earned and purposeful, compressing multiple resonances without over-explanation. Minor register elevation in "delta logic" and "polyphonic rush" at emotional peaks fits the established voice of a scientist comfortable with metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited holds steadily to Elara's perception, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("breathless pause," "amber time," "nursery of narrative"), reading as consistent narrative voice rather than POV-specific cognition. The prose remains legible but filter-heavy ("She was," "Her presence here depended on"), dulling immediacy in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on measurement and absence, but the lexicon (e.g., "surgical intention," "negative portrait") drifts toward abstract/academic register that feels imposed rather than character-organic under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct textural register—geometric, alchemical, crystalline—that matches Kael's chef-as-processor identity. Diction like "sturdy brittle," "digestive system," "enzyme," and "consommé of acceptance" sustains a consistent metaphorical palette. However, elevated phrasing occasionally drifts into abstraction ("threshold hour when sleep dissolves but its purpose remains") without anchoring in Kael's immediate sensory experience. The perceptual signature is coherent but seldom modulates under pressure; sentence rhythm remains uniform across dawn reflection and underground climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice maintains elevated diction ("guttural consonants," "vigorous tender melody," "hush of borrowed starlight"). However, perceptual signature is thin—Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific, and the prose reads as authorial rather than filtered through her urgency or fatigue. Register remains uniformly literary without modulation under the pressure of the climb or the singing. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture tied to Elara's interior state.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice converges with abstract academic register ("quantum foam," "synaptic plasticity," "stochastic dance of neurotransmitters") that does not feel character-particular under stress. Psychic distance fluctuates without purpose: some lines offer close embodiment ("her hands shook"), others drift into omniscient declaration ("the canyon breathed around her, its moonlit shadows shifting as if the rocks themselves were undergoing metamorphosis"). The diction reads as engineered for conceptual demonstration rather than filtered through Elena's lived priorities. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("clandestinely luminous," "serpentine," "latent blaze"), establishing a voice anchored in archival and alchemical idiom. However, the perceptual signature leans abstract: "prism-minded" and "refracted angles of possibility" describe Elara's trait rather than showing her selective, biased way of noticing under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt her stomach lurch," "needed to reenter") cluster in the opening without voice motivation, and the prose does not compress or shift rhythm during the peak beat (memorizing the sequences), missing an opportunity to embody urgency through syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (symphonically minded, grain-reading). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("cambium," "lignin," "subsonic whisper"), grounding the voice in Elara's expertise without register drift. Psychic distance modulates intentionally at the climax (the hum, the tears). No head-hopping, and the prose reflects Elara's analytical yet reverent stance throughout. Minor reliance on filter verbs ("detected," "visualized") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the elevated diction ("transfiguration," "thoughtfully precise," "grotesque, beautiful in their difficulty") matches Castian's role as former King's Strategist. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees the world in geometric patterns, constraint, and poetry. However, the prose occasionally drifts into meta-commentary ("not as absence, but as density," "not about winning or losing, but about maintaining the tension") that sounds more like the author explicating than Castian thinking under pressure. The register remains high throughout without modulation, which flattens urgency at key beats. Sentence rhythm is controlled but somewhat uniform, with many long, clause-heavy constructions that don't vary enough with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("velvet coat," "pregnant sky," "explosive aria") that fits the theatrical-sincerity tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract essay voice ("a measurable phenomenon, a convergence of wavelengths") that undercuts embodied perception. Elio's perceptual signature (sensing tremors, hearing clasp hum at specific hertz) is consistent but reads more as allegorical demonstration than character-specific noticing. No dialogue is present; filter verbs ("He understood," "He believed") are frequent but voice-motivated given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is clear: Elara's olfactory focus ("damp earth and distant thunder," "metallic to musky") colors every observation. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register inconsistent with peak sensory moments—"emotional architecture," "liminal moment," "symbiosis between her own biology and the plant's mysterious chemistry"—that reads more like essayistic narration than embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence structure and vocabulary remain uniform across reflective and action beats. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with psychic distance controlled and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Kael's professional filter (charting arches, calibrating sensors) and the prose carries a consistent, elevated register. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("memorial," "continuity itself") that feels essayistic rather than character-particular under pressure. Dialogue is absent (acceptable), and free indirect style is clean when used. Sentence rhythm modulates with scene needs—short bursts during the flip, longer lines during discovery—but some template stems recur ("She discovered," "She understood," "She worked quickly").

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision layered with metaphor ("metal maze," "knife-edge of wind shear"), professional lexicon (anemometer, thermal layers, rotor wash) inflected with lyric compression ("corrugated steel boxes," "sulfur-lit clearing"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during measurement, pulling back for synthesis ("geometric certainty"). The prose texture remains consistent under pressure. One minor filter-verb cluster in paragraph four ("found scorch marks," "measured the blast radius") slightly dulls immediacy, but doesn't break voice. No dialogue to evaluate. Elision is minimal and purposeful (Chen's final moments told, not shown, which fits the investigative frame).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature (synesthesia as mint and copper, geometric color shards) is vivid but applied uniformly without modulation under pressure. Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate crisis: "oscillating repose," "synesthetically blessed acolyte," "cathedral of frozen breath" in the opening beat. Filter verbs ("felt the impending impact," "perceived the silence") dull immediacy. No dialogue present to assess. Voice is competent but lacks rhythmic control that tightens with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, anchored in Mira's perception, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "avalanchingly quiet," "the canyon hush settle over the range like a held breath that had waited centuries to be released." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cosmic tension," "topology of her mistake," "mathematical precision") that sits uneasily with embodied immediacy. Metaphoric density is high—nearly every sentence carries figurative language—but remains coherent and voice-consistent. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays close without filter-verb stacking, though some constructions ("she understood now that guardianship had never been…") summarize epiphany rather than enacting discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-close on Elara; perceptual signature is strong (type as "tiny personalities," emotions as solvable equations). Diction is controlled and voice-specific—"lucid turbulence" coheres through metaphor density and syntactic rhythm. The cartographer's interiority ("gasped, utterly disoriented") briefly shifts psychic distance but stays filtered through Elara's observation. No head-hopping, and the elevated register ("viscous black ink," "longitude of grief") fits the established metaphysical tone without jarring slips.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature (noticing what others overlook, electric prickle of transformation) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats: "sympathetically... ionized air... phosphorescent... bioluminescence" reads academic rather than courier-specific. The archivist's dialogue ("You carry the Wing of Kael") and Elias's reflection both trend toward faux-archaic tone. Dialogue advances plot but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. The prose compresses effectively but voice specificity weakens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, Elara's perceptual signature clear (seventeen years documenting stones' weeping, metal's memory). No head-hopping. Yet elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats: "spectral ghosts," "fractal language," "reliquary of love and loss." Under stress, the prose remains ornate rather than compressing to Elara's urgency. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful. The single line of dialogue ("Objects remember") feels understated, but the surrounding narration over-explains her proof, dulling immediacy. Distance control is consistent, but register does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: elevated, lyrical diction ("wistful," "stoically sparkling," "raveling silence") with purposeful archaism ("dwelt alone," "thirty winters past") that suits a fable-like register. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, anchored to Maya's perception throughout; no head-hopping. Rhythmic variety supports emotional peaks: the final paragraph's short declaratives ("She smiled as her body grew transparent") accelerate after long, layered sentences earlier. However, the prose leans heavily on stock poetic constructions—"the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" recurs verbatim, "stoically sparkling" becomes a refrain, and phrases like "beautiful as glass under pressure" echo familiar lyric templates. Compression is purposeful (we skip years in a single sentence: "Days blurred into years"), but some elisions (how the message reaches the daughter) rely on atmosphere rather than earned inference. The voice is consistent and legible, with no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats, but the reliance on elevated stock imagery prevents full originality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elara's perceptions throughout. Diction is elevated and lyric ("whisper of steel," "azure defiance"), fitting the fantastical setting, though vocabulary occasionally drifts into high register ("foreclosing," "negotiation") that feels less character-bound than prose-essay. Psychic distance remains consistent, with no head-hopping. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—her smith's precision is told more than shown in moment-by-moment choices, and the narrative voice sounds generic-literary rather than inflected by her particular way of noticing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in her sensory-mapping discipline ("ghost vibrations," "stretching void between parallel universes"). The prose maintains elevated diction throughout, which fits the abstract premise but occasionally drifts intoorporate register ("cartographic senses," "topography of his withheld truth") that feels less like character voice and more like authorial framing. No head-hopping. Distance control is consistent, though the final paragraphs telescope forward in time ("The work took years measured in breaths") without clear scenic anchoring, creating a summary effect that dilutes immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable single third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("cairns left on the widow's walk," "the vocabulary of currents"), though elevated diction in peak beats ("crystalline clarity," "translucent need," "luminescent ache") occasionally drifts above Elara's working register. Perceptual signature is specific (rust as coastal flowers, solitude's angle in a keeper's spine) and remains character-bound. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated, and tense/stance remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice remains stable and carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture. Psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature (ozone, ink, starlight as geometry) is specific. However, elevated diction ("prophetic hymn," "spectral geometries," "liquid luminescence") pervades without modulation under pressure, risking register drift from the ritual action. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear but do not flatten immediacy significantly. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable (tight third, dye master's perceptual signature throughout: indigo/cochineal analogies, sediment/fixing-bath metaphors). Diction remains within the character's lexicon (craft-specific, contemplative), and psychic distance modulates purposefully when external observation (sun trails, wing position) alternates with interior reflection. The prose rhythm slows appropriately during watchful beats and accelerates slightly at the climactic insight. Minor deduction: the density of figurative language in reflective passages ("sediment," "mineral stain," "spores on morning air," "radiant, accumulating tales") occasionally tips toward overwriting, especially in the final third where elevated register ("valley-mist wonder," "explosive quiet") recurs without sufficient grounding in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, perceptual signature consistent (Elara notices grain, vapor-trails, bioluminescence). Diction carries a purposeful elevated register ("testimony rather than judgment," "cartography of the soul") that risks slipping above the maintenance-worker frame but reads as voice-committed lyricism rather than drift. Rhythm modulates across beats: short syntax during the pin-drop realization, longer cadence in the tower scene. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak moments. The final paragraph edges toward thematic summary but anchors in concrete image (ear to trunk, instrument warming in hand).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the diction ("silvered leaves," "antediluvian song," "tone of bound release") establishes a mythic, lyric register. Perceptual signature is present but leans toward elevated abstraction rather than embodied interiority: "her motivation burning like cold fire" tells rather than grounds in sensory immediacy. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was intimate and absolute," "felt the resonance") accumulate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The prose sustains voice consistency but lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable; distance modulates appropriately from Elias's interior ("keenly empathetic heart") to his actions. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose carries a distinct meditative texture: "enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradoxes," "errors nested inside corrections." Perceptual signature is present in Elias's empathic sensing of "tidal emotions" and "her loneliness radiate through the masonry," though the latter phrase borders on convenient clairvoyance rather than character-specific perception. Diction remains elevated and consistent, occasionally verging on over-literary ("unburied the wisdom," "the paradox was complete") but coherent within the narrative stance. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the voice is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited focalization through Mara is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices incremental change, speaks to soil, moves with deliberate gentleness. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("the fermentation of dough and the patience of growing things"), which fits the reflective, observational stance. The single line of dialogue ("We lost the bakery slowly...") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing theme without exposition. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("divinity hid not in cathedrals") and the prose leans toward uniform syntactic patterns (long, clause-heavy sentences). Under peak pressure (the communal meal), the voice maintains its texture but does not modulate or compress to reflect emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara's archival lens: "gently meticulous precision," technical vocabulary (resonator, photonic resonance, spectral thread), and the habit of translating experience into measurement. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible focalization—"mnemonic energy releasing," "photonic resonance"—but reads as professional idiom rather than register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (millisecond sampling, chest tightening). The prose rhythm modulates well, from the slow opening catalog to compressed urgency ("capturing frequencies now in milliseconds") to elegiac stillness at close. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Mara notices the lieutenant's "velvet and treacherous" voice, the market's "curiously steadfast heartbeat"—but the filtering leans toward stock poetic phrases rather than character-specific idiom. The brief dialogue is functional and carries subtext ("Pretty" as threat-test), though the agent and lieutenant remain under-voiced. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative certainty fits what Mara can know. Diction control is adequate but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("comforting unease," "crystalline and sharp") that feels authorial rather than rooted in a moonshine runner's daughter's voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans on ornamental phrasing ("futuristic nostalgia for sterile predictions," "democratic approval") that dilutes immediacy. Dialogue carries exposition rather than subtext; the thunder-bearer and cyclone-bearer speak in thesis statements about their symbolic role. Perceptual signature (taste-based sensing) is introduced but applied mechanically as flavor labels (copper, honey, salt; ozone, lavender, interstellar cold) without shaping Elara's choices or revealing bias.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register incongruent with an artist under pressure ("mnemonically gifted," "mathematical poetry of the sequence," "chronicler, its witness") that reads as authorial rather than character-specific perception. Narrative distance wavers between tight interiority and explanatory summarizing ("her talent reduced to a parlor trick," "the weight of unfulfilled purpose"). Filter verbs and abstract phrasing ("the inescapable calling pulsed through her") dull immediacy at peak beats. No dialogue; not applicable for that bullet.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout. Aurelia's perceptual signature (calligrapher's eye, gilded leaves, ink-stained fingers) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Marcus's admission carries subtext. The prose maintains a steady, slightly elevated register appropriate to the setting, though some phrasing trends toward stock lyricism ("cathedral silence," "tears from metal supports"). No head-hopping or filter-verb issues; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (attention to vibration, altitude effects, color). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though it drifts toward elevated register in high-concept moments ("humanity had learned to communicate through pressure and silence"). No dialogue appears. The prose sustains a consistent narrative distance and voice-motivated lexicon, but the lack of stress-driven modulation or psychic distance shifts keeps it from high-band scores where voice would tighten under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael-9's voice blends machine precision ("calculating soil pH levels") with nostalgic longing. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the burn sequence. However, several lines drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than android-specific ("beautiful in its imperfect integrity," "topology where damage was not error but evolution"). The prose maintains clarity and no head-hopping occurs, but the vocabulary occasionally exceeds what the established voice earns.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Maya's perceptual filter. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("deferred grief," "ritual older than their steel," "architecture of a place") that feels writerly rather than character-specific. Mrs. Rodriguez's dialogue ("They say she waited by the mailbox every day for thirty years") and Maya's unearned certainty about the locket's intended recipient both feel expository. The prose texture is controlled but lacks the idiom-specific signature that would distinguish Maya's interior voice under pressure. No head-hopping, but psychic distance widens at closure when collective emotional reaction is narrated with unwarranted certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable, and the voice carries elevated diction ("lyrical mathematics," "choreography of defiance") that fits the conceptual frame. Purposeful compression and parallelism ("as a spider spins its web" × 3) teach a pattern, though repetition tilts toward decorative. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She explained through dance") remain manageable, but psychic distance stays remote—Elara's perceptual signature is filtered through abstract narration rather than moment-by-moment sensation during high-stakes dance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's perceptual signature is distinct: she notices "minor alterations in the waterfront's geography," reads grounds as coordinates, and interprets the whale's hum as marrow-vibration. The prose texture is controlled, with purposeful compression ("gleaming silence," "sodium chloride formations that grew like frozen lightning"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Some filter verbs ("understood," "suspected") dull immediacy in peak beats, and the phrase "deletion had been not destruction but migration" leans expository, but voice remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable and focalization is controlled, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction defaults to elevated fantasy register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") without character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("she felt the words trying to flow") and expository constructions ("This was the paradox she embodied") dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains uniformly remote, never modulating with the supposed intensity of the working. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maya throughout; psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("dialects she couldn't parse," "dead tongues," "palimpsest") that fits the architectural focus. Elias's dialogue ("We seal our letters to preserve intent; buildings seal their histories in stone") is exposition-forward but voice-plausible for a dead-language scholar. Register remains consistent, though some phrases ("mysterious familiarity," "patiently nimble") feel more authorial than character-specific. The narrative stance holds across emotional beats, and filter verbs ("feeling the grooves," "hoping the cosmic rhythm") are purpose-driven rather than dulling.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries an elevated, baroque register ("tragically radiant," "spectral geometries," "ghostly resolve") that remains consistent but edges toward purple in peak moments with stacked modifiers and abstract diction. The perceptual signature is ornate and philosophical rather than character-particular; Elara perceives in polished metaphors even under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The voice modulates appropriately from description to reflection but lacks the compression or syntactic shift that would mark genuine crisis pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Voice carries a distinct elevated register—"pearl twilight," "stalactites dripped their mineral music"—that fits the sanctified setting and Elara's patient isolation. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("calibrated treason," "unlink the present bloodshed from the past's failure") that feels more thesis-like than character-particular. Perceptual signature is consistent but not deeply idiosyncratic; the narrator's way of noticing leans lyric-descriptive rather than urgently selective under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose sustains a consistent lyric register with strong perceptual signature ("harmonic resonance of dark matter," "gypsum in desert air"). Psychic distance is stable and purposeful compression fits the accumulative mode. However, elevated diction ("reed-blown melancholy," "progressive disclosure") occasionally drifts above immediate sensory grounding, and the Archivists' dialogue ("you carry the resonance key") reads expository rather than goal-driven. Filter verbs ("understood," "recognized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elara; perceptual signature is present in her attention to "cameo appearances" and "borrowed starlight," though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("residual warmth of that sacrifice," "mosaic clearer than any single memory") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The ghost captain's single line of dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly weight. No head-hopping; free indirect style is mostly clean, but some abstractions ("concentrated essence of a father's love") flatten immediacy at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Kaelen notices spider webs, moon paths, firefly cartographies—details filtered through her philosophical lens. Diction is elevated but consistent ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") and voice-motivated for a contemplative philosopher. No head-hopping. The prose modulates purposefully between description and action. One brief register slip: "phosphorescent wings" reads slightly clinical for the established lyric-meditative texture, but does not break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; distance is controlled. Diction is consistent and professional without register drift. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated. Voice has texture: "offended her need to excavate truth from comfortable lies," "broken physics," "salvageable science." One slip: "sharply observant" is asserted three times as a label rather than demonstrated through her noticing choices. Filter verbs ("began to intuit," "understanding now") appear in peak beats and dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "gritty whimsy" manifests in mushroom beards by design, "locksmith of realities," shadows as origami swans, and lyrically prophetic radio frequencies. POV remains stable third-limited to Elian with no head-hopping. Diction blends elevated register ("variant allegiance," "dream-geometry") with tactile particulars ("grit in a gear," "trails of condensation"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully ("He did not want the carpenter to rule; he wanted…"). A few phrases ("hollow vessel ringing with the frequency of change") edge toward abstraction under peak pressure, but overall the perceptual signature—filtering storm and prophecy through a technical, solitary lens—holds.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is literary and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (auditory focus, archival metaphors). Psychic distance is stable in tight third. The phrase "positively wistful" recurs identically at two emotional peaks, suggesting template echo rather than character-specific syntax. Register occasionally elevates ("phonetic map," "herald") in ways that feel imposed rather than organic to a vagrant's interior vocabulary. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("fleshly ethereal," "liquify the air," "logarithmic calculation") that remains internally consistent. However, diction at peak beats drifts into abstraction ("sonic absolution," "harmonic forgiveness," "vibrational matching") that clashes with the embodied urgency of the chase, reading more as conceptual exposition than lived perception. Perceptual signature is present (engineer's focus on beam angles, blueprints, frequencies) but the voice at closure smooths into thesis rather than intensifying under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture ("wolves dressed in meditation," "tectonic lullaby"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("restrained wildness," "tyranny of now") that feels authored rather than character-specific, and some filter verbs ("felt the wildness inside her stretch and settle") dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains consistent, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; distance control is mostly consistent. The prose carries a distinctive rhythm ("watchfully calm," "fortified vulnerability") that attempts professional-yet-poetic register. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction not fully grounded in Maya's investigative mindset: "cascade of entangled memories," "empirical observations would be her liberation." These phrases read more authorial than character-particular. Free indirect style works in the observational beats (noting frayed rope, displaced gravel) but wobbles when processing emotion through conceptual labels rather than specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is largely consistent (penitentiary, slate gray, vibrant hush), though phrases like "aptly deliberate" and "vibrant hush" recur as mannered tics. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("I need a second opinion," "How long?"), carrying subtext of regret and urgency. The repairman's lines are distinct in craft-specific idiom ("Comtoise movement," "mainspring"), but his internal stance remains opaque. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure (short sentences at the oath moment), and free indirect style is clean. One flaw: "aptly deliberate" appears twice, once as narrator commentary and once attributed to the repairman, blurring voice slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kip; perceptual signature is consistent—mechanical phenomena described through grinding, humming, vibrating, prismatic equations "visible only through" the kaleidoscope. Voice modulates appropriately: calm curiosity early, urgency at "escalating...desperate," and release in the laugh at closure. Diction remains character-specific: "floating monstrosity of brass and bile," "tasted like copper," "reverent absurdity." The single line of dialogue ("Another Tuesday") carries subtext (routine meets awe) and fits voice. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. One hairline slip: "seemed to ask questions rather than answer them" edges toward over-articulation, but the texture holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, archival quality—"brightly attentive," "digital ephemera," "liminal space"—that suits the protagonist and setting. Diction occasionally drifts into thesis-speak: "corporate fiction maintained to comfort billions" and "experimental storage system" feel expository rather than character-filtered. The phrase "singing in the silence between the notes of songs we no longer remember but can never forget" in the final line shifts into lyric register that contradicts the prior clinical tone. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solo investigation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("reconstitute the very foundation," "executable strategy") that clashes with the fairy-tale orchard and shadow-magic frame. Template cadence pervades: "She raised… She moved… She positioned… She shifted… She angled…" across five sequential beats. The shadows are described but never focalized—how they feel on her skin, whether they itch or chill. Elara's perceptual signature defaults to visual cataloging without bias or selectivity tied to her stated intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is lyric-dense with a consistent elevated register: "ethereal detachment," "windborne solace," "filigree tattoo against her heart." Psychic distance is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature—sky gripping reality loosely, ice singing lullabies, destruction as rearrangement—is distinct and character-specific. However, the diction occasionally drifts toward abstract poeticism ("the fold in patience had opened into a door, then a window, then simply an aperture") that risks losing concrete grounding. The prose reflects the focalizer's philosophical stance throughout, and no head-hopping occurs. Under peak stress, the compression remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable first-person-close on Elena; distance is controlled. Diction is literary and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (viticulture lens, seasonal metaphor). However, register drifts into academic abstraction ("intersubjective understanding," "chemical antagonisms," "architecture of human intimacy") that sits uneasily with a solitary sentinel at twilight. The prose occasionally narrates insignificant movements (smoothing paper, brushing leaves) without pressure, and the elevated tone remains uniform under emotional stress rather than modulating.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (the visible eye tracing sand, the hidden eye perceiving "what straight sight could never hold"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with purposeful compression ("kinetic parapet beneath the dunes," "whisperfield calm") that teaches a pattern and remains legible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can plausibly know, and psychic distance shifts intentionally (wider during spiral approach, closer during mask removal). Dialogue is absent. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats, and the perceptual filter (peripheral awareness, half-masked vision) remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, with a distinct lyric-accumulative register: "perceptively calm," "inch by patient inch," "visual rhymes." Elara's perceptual signature is consistent—she notices arcs, curves, bowed heads—and diction stays elevated but voice-appropriate throughout. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The prose modulates with seasonal progression (spring to autumn, vines climbing) and maintains psychic distance without head-hopping. Elara's way of seeing is specific and filters all detail, meeting the 9+ perceptual-signature test, but the lack of pressure-driven compression or friction under stress keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (scholar's lens, preference for spores over syntax) is consistent. Diction is elevated and voice-specific, though occasionally tipping toward purple density ("suspended hush," "fractured sequences," "sonically reflective" repeated three times). No dialogue to judge. The prose texture is distinct but borders on overwriting in high-detail beats without corresponding pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a lyric-accumulative texture. Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-motivated ("hollow certainty," "acoustic shadow of entropy"). The prose modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the writing scene, then the unspooling). Some figurative density risks overwriting ("magnetic ghosts whispering static," "tidal longing pulled at his ribs"), but patterns remain legible and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("luminous ache," "sweet sorrow," "phantom descent") establishes a lyric register consistent with Elara's sensibility. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—phrases like "violence of a waking giant" and "accumulated weight of unrecorded light pressing against the walls like water against a failing dam" feel authored rather than filtered through a camera repairer's concrete expertise. Psychic distance floats during peak beats ("she felt the luminous ache then") rather than anchoring in embodied sensation, and some constructions ("the sound of a leaf falling, that nearly silent percussion") read as elevated exposition rather than lived perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV anchored in Elena is mostly stable, with clear psychic distance. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness," "saturated with meaning") in ways that read slightly above ground-level hospice-worker interiority, though the lyric mode may justify it. Perceptual signature is present (Elena's focus on IV clicks, sheet creases). No dialogue to judge. The final paragraph's "She had executed" pulls back into summary rather than staying in the ending image's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in rune-scholar diction ("old geometries," "recursive loops of spacetime") and the narrative voice modulates with the task's intensity. However, some register drift occurs: "the sealed awakenings had been sealed not as punishment but as preservation" reads as authorial summary rather than Elara's processing. Free indirect style is mostly clean. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for a budding scholar, though phrases like "dimensional fold" and "liminal space" lean toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elena with a controlled, literary register ("cracked her rationalism like a dropped porcelain doll," "nostalgic innovation of scents"). Perceptual signature is present—Elena filters the garden through her scientific and now-magical lens—and the prose modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during the bone-setting). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the changeling's "Will it hurt?" and Elena's "Only if you fight it" carry subtext and advance plot. Two weaknesses: the phrase "shrewdly innocent" is repeated verbatim, and some diction ("cleft in certainty," "stitched together from old wounds") leans toward lyric ornament that slightly dulls immediacy. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("zephyr bloom," "cathedral of stone and vapor") that matches the reflective, reverent tone. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("accumulated silences," "density of years") that feels more authorial than character-bound, especially given Mira's embodied, tactile work. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply particularized; her way of noticing leans poetic rather than showing a character-specific filter shaped by her past as a star.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (watchful, botanical, metaphor-dense). Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the reflective mode. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (drip/absorb, graft/splice) are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor artifact: some filter verbs ("watching water bead," "recognizing the pattern") dull immediacy in peak beats. Register is consistent but occasionally slips into abstract philosophizing ("erosion could be a form of language") that flattens embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara, but psychic distance is inconsistent—some sentences occupy her lyric interior ("fragile architectures of possibility"), others narrate from outside ("she knew she must solemnize"). Diction oscillates between elevated philosophical register and concrete image without a unifying perceptual signature. No dialogue. The prose occasionally falls into template cadence: "She moved against the current… She had come to this wild intersection… She was not ending her career…" Stock metaphors ("wild things between the trees," "door") blunt specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with Elara's perceptual signature evident in technical detail ("dew point precise to the fraction," "cellular rhythm"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains POV plausibility: "reciprocity," "sympathetic resonance," "vegetative life" feel authorial rather than character-rooted for a whimsical tinkerer. Psychic distance is consistent, though some phrases—"using her as its instrument," "narrative and nitrogen"—read as narrator commentary rather than Elara's thought. Voice is competent but lacks syntactic distinctness; the prose could belong to many fantasy narrators.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated register throughout. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The narrative voice foregrounds metaphor and lush diction ("cathedral of ice and silence," "meditation...creating patterns") that maintains atmospheric cohesion. However, under peak pressure (the sealing moment) the syntax does not tighten or shift; the prose texture remains uniform, which flattens urgency. Perceptual signature is poetic but not character-specific—Elara's way of noticing reads more as authorial lyricism than alchemist's focus.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is ornate and controlled, with a consistent lyric register ("the lull of the wounded season," "sound did not fade but pooled in crystalline hollows"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited; Elias's perceptual signature—peripheral vision, reflection-angle mapping—is distinct and purposeful. The prose maintains coherence under pressure, though the elevated diction ("temporal resonance," "magnetic rhythm of brass and marble") risks distancing the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register and avoids head-hopping (single third-person limited throughout). However, the diction often drifts into abstract poeticism that obscures rather than sharpens perception: "skeletal and profound as a beached leviathan singing its death song," "the braille of accumulated human experience." Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; any lyric narrator could perceive this way. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew") stack without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (circus-trained attention to grain, ropes, reins). Diction stays within Mara's register until occasional elevated flourishes: "hauntingly practical immortality," "architecture of her survival," "rust-hued peace" feel imposed rather than emerging from her working-class circus background. The skylight-as-lens device works well, but repeated syntactic templates in the final third flatten rhythm: "The lions were gone, the tent folded, the crowds dispersed, but the wood remained" and similar constructions create a summary cadence. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she thought," "she saw") appear frequently without tonal necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, elevated register ("fractured stillness," "temporal dissonance," "sediment, compressed layers of compromise"). Distance remains consistent, and the narrative voice carries a distinct textural signature. However, diction in peak beats ("chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions") drifts into abstract thesis language rather than perceptual specificity. The ghost's voice overlaps Mara's in register and syntax, reducing distinction; under pressure, both speak in the same poetic cadence without idiom shift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Maya's engineer's lexicon ("circulatory systems," "pressure differential," "channeling"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees "bridges where others saw barriers" and reads decay as pattern. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("stoic wonder," "grammar of sustenance") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, especially under what should be high-pressure decision points. No dialogue present; internal monologue remains singular and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV, stable third limited with Elara's perceptual filter (clock scribe's precision, "seventeen years documenting mechanisms"). Diction is lyric and controlled ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "ghost tempo") but registers high throughout, with phrases like "bruised sky," "spectral scales," "harmonic" that feel more authorial than character-particular. Filter verbs ("seemed to shiver," "understood then") are voice-appropriate but cluster. The prose maintains consistent distance and no head-hopping, yet the elevated register flattens urgency in peak beats (kneeling, opening the case) where compression might serve pressure better.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured with a distinct perceptual signature: "cumulative deviation," "gnomic dial," "cartographic lies," "the serene upheaval of her worldview." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative stance modulates appropriately—more compressed and fragmented during realization beats ("The architecture of lies became visible now"), more expansive in reflection. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "the quiet violence of paradigm shift," "molecular structure," "perceptual toolkit." Free indirect style is clean, but some sentences lean on "had" constructions that dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are n/a. The prose reflects urgency in shorter beats near the end, but earlier paragraphs sustain long, stacked clauses that risk becoming a signature tic rather than voice modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent: "oceanic hush," "forgotten depths," "consciousness distributed through every fiber." The piece employs purposeful compression and lyric patterning, teaching a meditative rhythm early. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices in catalog fashion without character-specific bias. Phrases like "time moved differently" and "already searching" edge toward telling rather than showing stance. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("he knew," "understanding that") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable, with a literary register that fits the elegiac subject and Elian's role as obituary-writer. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices sensory detail through metaphor (iron-gray horizon, bleeding ochres) and ritual (thread around finger, blood-return rush). Diction remains controlled, though some constructions edge toward overwriting ("lonesome splendor," "explained absences"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed to thicken," "as if hearing") are voice-motivated and support the conjuring method. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the projection sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a dreamy, lyric cadence. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elian's scientist mind and decades of isolation do not yield distinct filters or idiom. Key phrases ("quaking reverie," "bitterly sweet," "hypothesizing about everything") recur as verbal tics rather than voice-specific markers. Psychic distance wavers: "he had realized," "he knew" stack filter verbs in reflective stretches, dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears. The voice reads as competent but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would elevate it to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct lyric texture with extended metaphors and elevated diction ("gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace," "geological time"). However, register repeatedly drifts into abstract lyricism that feels authorial rather than character-bound—would a firefighter think "cellular possibility of new growth and regeneration" or "marks that spoke louder than DNA"? Perceptual signature is consistent but generic; the narration could belong to any reflective protagonist rather than this one. No dialogue on the page to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic," "defiant hush"). Perceptual signature is present but occasionally drifts into authorial summary rather than Elara's specific filtering. The phrase "realistically imaginative mind" and "temporal pocket where the past could be exhumed" read as external framing rather than her voice. Purposeful compression and patterned diction support the accumulative design, and the final paragraph modulates appropriately. Minor slips: "She possessed a realistically imaginative mind" is tell-heavy, and some figurative language ("breath misting in the cold," "soft thunder") veers generic. No dialogue present, so those bullets are moot. Distance control is generally clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout—"compressed longing," "watercolor ghosts," "cathedral of gas"—that reads as intentional voice but risks uniformity under pressure; the diction does not modulate when stakes tighten. Perceptual signature is consistent (cosmic scale, sentimental framing) but not character-particular; another sentinel might notice the same images in similar language. Psychic distance remains mid-far, limiting embodied immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—meditative, attuned to breath and rhythm—is coherent and voice-specific. Dialogue (the grandmother's lines and traded poems) carries purpose and subtext, distinguishing her spectral timbre from Elias's spoken verses. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that exceeds the moment's organic texture: "thundering calm," "fiercely meditative," "the geometry of shared mourning," "infinite dimensions." These phrases feel imposed rather than arising from the carver's working idiom. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the grandmother's quoted directive and Elias's simultaneous understanding occasionally blur the line between her voice and his realization. Strongest control appears in tactile moments: "wrapped the woven ribbon roll around his wrist, feeling the pressure."

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; no head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct texture—formal diction ("velocity surrendered to gravity," "microscopic grooves"), sensory precision, and a measured rhythm that mirrors Elias's meticulous nature. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the adjustment beat. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("obsidian ridge," "labyrinth of his own failings") that tests but does not break the character's interior lexicon. "Searing reverie" appears twice, a phrase that feels imported rather than organically Elias's own thought pattern, but the perceptual signature—his focus on measurements, inscriptions, mechanical truth—remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, though elevated diction—"velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes," "filament of intention"—reads more literary than character-particular for a gardener, creating mild register drift. Perceptual signature is present (knowing thorns by name, mathematical precision), but under peak discovery the prose does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect urgency. Internal voice is coherent but tilts toward authorial lyricism rather than Mara's embodied idiom. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, and perceptual filtering is present (Elara notices dawn light through a cartographer's lens). However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register inconsistent with embodied crisis: "cartographer of ignorance," "suspended in the transformation that preceded all true creation." Filter verbs ("she thought," "she felt") stack in the final third without voice-motivated purpose. The narration over-explains symbolic meaning ("map of what could be") rather than trusting dramatization, flattening the voice into a committee tone that privileges theme over character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyrically dense, with a distinct texture ("ink that smelled of rain and regret," "thistled calm"). POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, though the summary-epilogue mode in the final third shifts into distant omniscience ("scholars studied," "children found") without clear anchoring, weakening the perceptual signature under pressure. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Voice is consistently elevated and lyric, with purposeful compression and poetic diction ("weaves truth carefully through the holes of their limited understanding"). However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-particular ("accumulating silence," "horizon that receded faster than memory could chase"). Free indirect style is clean, though repeated sentence structures ("He had…," "The…") create rhythmic monotony in places. Perceptual signature is present but sometimes generic rather than specific to Elias's craft-trained eye.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices gear ratios, calcified walls, and the cog's "spiral" with mechanical specificity. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("abrasive calm," "wannabe philosopher," "rationally rebellious"). However, passages drift into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon: "geological strata, each layer compressing the lies of the one above until truth became a diamond of unbearable density" reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Psychic distance is intentional and serves emotional beats, but the ornate phrasing in reflective passages slightly loosens grip on Elias's interior voice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV third-limited focalization is stable and anchored in Elias's perceptual bias (the rosette "seemed to pulse," sounds "like incense or memory"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("denote," "consonance," "resonance") that, while consistent, flattens immediacy under pressure. The three students lack distinct speech or interior voice; their collective leaning and trembling read as template gestures rather than individual perceptual signatures.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into academic and diagnostic registers ("synaptic plasticity," "prefrontal cortex actively pruned," "dendritic weight," "molecular blueprint") that clash with the lyric texture and read as authorial intrusion rather than Mara's voice under pressure. The prose modulates between vivid image ("tasting forty years of acid rain") and exposition ("the biological miracle of neural adaptation") without a consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue appears; interiority is often summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third around Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("liquid gold," "poetry of their chaotic final flight") that occasionally drifts above a toll keeper's plausible idiom, especially under the claimed compulsion to speak. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the engineer's exchange feels natural. The phrase "his condition preventing any diplomatic hesitation" tells rather than dramatizes the involuntary truthfulness, and the subsequent monologue reads more like a prepared lecture than compelled utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in tight third with Maya's perceptual signature evident throughout: "creeping normality noticer," attention to "doorknobs turned a fraction slower," "grammar of rearrangement." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("hush between heartbeats," "daydreaming cycle," "hushed blaze"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond Maya's immediate perception into lyric abstraction: "the pause between waves," "decades of quiet moments pressed into timber and stone until the structure itself began to dream." These moments read more as authorial voice than character filter. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at the climax (closer during the orris root placement, pulling back for the reflective final paragraph), and narrative stance remains consistent. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature (telepathic receptors, stone skin, incisively kind attention) and a lexicon grounded in geology and architecture (calcified, lattice, substrate, silt). Register remains elevated throughout, which fits the meditative stance but flattens under peak pressure (ampoule shattering, garden shuddering) where sharper syntax might lift urgency. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. The prose reads coherent but lacks rhythmic modulation at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (mathematical, paradoxical) colors diction ("coefficient of regret," "axiomatic weight"). However, register drifts elevated in peak beats: "abandon observation," "participate," "profound ringing silence," "manifest" read academic rather than urgent, flattening immediacy when Elara inscribes the final theorem and steps through. Purposeful compression ("Up is down...sideways is the universe's private joke") works in early whispers but the proof-writing beat stacks abstraction without embodied micro-choices. No head-hopping; the voice is consistent but tonally uniform across emotional peaks and valleys.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is poetic and moon-focused; diction remains elevated throughout ("desperate breath of orchids," "slow silver constellations," "turmeric in warm milk"). Free indirect access to Maya's interiority is clean. One friction: the register is uniformly lyric even during the accumulation of visions, reducing contrast between calm ritual and peak transmission. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") appear but are voice-consistent. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara's "cultured diction" is asserted but not always embodied; phrases like "rosewater dread of beauty succumbing to entropy" and "navigational archives baked into sustenance" tilt toward editorial voice rather than character-specific perception under pressure. POV remains stable, and the prose reflects her role as curator, but syntactic patterns recur—"She lifted," "She descended," "She gathered," "She worked"—flattening rhythm. The elders' dialogue at the gathering is summarized rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and rhythmic, matching the conceptual ambition, but voice texture flattens under pressure: phrases like "bleak exhilaration," "neatly inventive," and "latent radiance" recur without evolving, creating a template cadence. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara notices in abstractions (chronology, fate, radiance) rather than character-specific idiom. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose reads as narrator-driven rather than filtered through Elara's particular way of seeing. No dialogue present. The voice is consistent but lacks the textural grit that would distinguish her interior world from the narrator's architectural language.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent gothic-horror register ("phosphorescent mold," "wet silk," "moth-eaten velvet") that matches the dream-logic frame. The advisor's dialogue ("You're photographically cursed") and the dream dictionary excerpts maintain tonal coherence. However, peak-moment interiority occasionally slides into abstract label-speak ("repulsive allure," "morbid artistic precision") rather than character-specific perception under stress. Perceptual signature is present (focus on light, clasp, trapped faces) but could be more distinctly Mara's lens rather than genre-default gothic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (she reads clouds as percussion, catalogues pitch). Diction is elevated and poetic but occasionally drifts into register mismatch: "alchemy that kept the driftwood circle from disintegrating into the hungry deep" reads more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is controlled, though some lines ("Where others saw...she saw") perform exposition rather than trust dramatization. Syntax varies purposefully with emotional intensity, but several sentence openings default to "The" or "She," creating mild template cadence. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and filters setting through Elara's cartographer's perception (shell grooves, Fibonacci sequences, "spiral architecture"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("calcified backs," "logarithmic curves," "suspended in amber light") without unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments (trembling fingers, the whistle falling). No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives at the climax ("The sky cracked") contrast with the longer, layered opening—and avoids filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is historian-specific (noting marginalia, counting railway sleepers, tracing vine-work borders). Diction is elevated and controlled, matching an academic focalization under moderate emotional pressure. Minor slip: "emotionally rational" recurs as a descriptor with slight therapy-speak flavor, though the phrase is tied to Elena's professional stance. The prose modulates appropriately when Elena walks the platform "counting... each step echoed with the weight of her responsibility," keeping internal texture consistent without elision that obscures motive.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice remains stable and employs elevated diction throughout ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze," "watery cathedral"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—phrases like "invisible architecture of human longing" could belong to any lyric observer. Register stays consistently elevated even during physical exertion (wading, wrenching door), reducing the sense of stress modulation. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in limited third with Elias's perceptual signature evident (water-warped spines, microscopic scoring marks). Register occasionally drifts into elevated academic diction ("tranquilly perceptive awareness," "dappled resolve manifesting") that reads more authorial than character-particular for a working archivist. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though some filter verbs ("understood now," "felt the reclaimed stillness settle") could sharpen. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative maintains stable third-person limited focalization through Mira's perceptual filter, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture (e.g., "shadow pooling on the tatami like spilled ink," "cathedral of prisms"), and purposeful compression suits the Accumulative lens. However, diction drifts into elevated, quasi-mystical register ("corporeal anchor," "vaporous nightmares," "architecture of mourning") that reads as imposed rather than character-rooted—Mira is a crafty lantern maker, yet her interiority speaks in poet-philosopher cadence without grounding in her craft idiom. Filter verbs ("felt herself," "understood then") are frequent but voice-motivated. The final paragraph's extended metaphor stack ("spiral staircase of consciousness, each step both a burial and a birth") obscures rather than sharpens the closure image under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV and tense are stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the way Amara filters the world through mathematics and grief. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("intangibly tangible," "quantum foam," "vibrating strings of possibility") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. Diction remains consistent within its chosen idiom, but that idiom flattens urgency rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable throughout; Elias's perceptual signature (sharp eyes, retinal display overlay, technical awareness) is consistent. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("encroaching deep violet," "ethereal frequencies," "stately dance") that feels more authorial than character-specific, especially given his drone-pilot background. The prose modulates with emotional intensity at the climax, but phrases like "perpetually surprised expression—a congenital feature" and "forgotten history of a lost civilization" read expository rather than dramatized through Elias's thought. No dialogue appears. Internal stance is confident and omniscient, with no uncertainty or inference marked as such.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with Elias throughout. Narrative distance is controlled and the perceptual signature is consistent—notice "sieved hush" and "tempered regret," which feel slightly elevated but remain within a reflective genealogist's register. Minor register drift: "specific gravity" and "tempered regret" lean academic in a peak moment. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains close and purposeful. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately with the accumulative pressure, slowing for the gallery arrangement at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to the negotiator's perceptual signature (counting seconds between lightning and thunder, feeling the brass warmed by her ribs). Voice is elevated and formal, consistent with the ritual framing, yet the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("accumulated weight of betrayals," "careful architecture of peace") that feels essayistic rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal; the negotiator's two lines feel ceremonial but lack subtext or resistance. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under peak pressure—the exchange itself unfolds at the same measured cadence as the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV (tight third, Elias) is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during embodied moments, slightly elevated during reflection). Voice is distinct—nautical idiom ("wet sail," "shark scenting blood," "old shanty"), metaphoric reach ("broken things could still cast light")—but some diction ("merrily melancholic," "flickering faith," "align heart and action") feels slightly authorial rather than character-specific under stress. No dialogue to judge. Perceptual signature is clear (navigator's eye tracking poles, magnetic interference, Polaris). Filter verbs ("felt," "sought") appear but remain voice-motivated. Tense and stance are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with strong perceptual signature: "scar tissue mapping crimes she no longer recalled," "jaded wanderer seeking wonder," descriptions filtered through her intelligence-analyst skill set. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("temporal displacement," "neural reset") that feels slightly external to a protagonist in crisis, and some phrases ("delicately robust construction," "accumulated guilt became a physical weight") repeat structural stems. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (kneeling, weeping), and the final image's shift to instructional role reflects earned stance change. No dialogue present to evaluate; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elara. Diction is consistently elevated and poetic, fitting the fairy-tale setting. However, register frequently drifts into abstract lyricism ("cosmic intimacy," "spectral threshold," "harmonics that made the blossoms shiver") that distances the reader from Elara's embodied experience. Mara's dialogue ("You don't lose yourself. You expand.") feels more thematically convenient than character-specific. Filter verbs and summary constructions ("she felt," "Elara felt") recur in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization remains with Elara throughout. Voice is dense and lyric, with purposeful compression and elevated diction ("cloudbound repentance," "choking beauty," "honey in dark comb") that suits the mythic cartomancer setting. Psychic distance is consistent, close enough for embodied sensation yet distanced enough for metaphoric layering. However, several formulations drift toward authorial lyricism rather than Elara's lived perception under stress: "willingly perplexed by the grandeur of it" and "accepting that time lost to motherhood wasn't stolen but transformed" read more like retrospective summary than in-the-moment cognition. No dialogue; not applicable here.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable. Voice carries a lyric, meditative register with purposeful compression ("recycled cathedral of rust and regret," "ghostly resolve"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated, matching the solitary, reflective narrator. However, perceptual signature is generic-philosophic rather than character-particular; Elias's way of noticing doesn't feel distinct from an omniscient essayist. Filter verbs ("He felt," "He understood") appear frequently and dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice sustains an elevated, lyric register with purposeful patterning: "pooling like spilled ink," "rhythmic whispering hush," "neither reflecting nor yielding, simply containing." POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (geological time, alchemy metaphors) is character-particular. However, diction occasionally drifts into thesis-speak—"orchestrating coincidences," "alchemy of surrender"—that feels like authorial commentary rather than Elias's lived lexicon under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, but the compression never varies cadence; every beat maintains the same ceremonial tempo regardless of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision ("twenty-three degrees," "thirteen steps"), metaphorical flourishes ("cradle of sparks," "winking hush"), and a controlled narrative distance. Diction is elevated and consistent, matching a character who has "spent years preparing" and values "theatrical precision." However, psychic distance flattens under pressure—no interior contradiction or compression during high-stakes beats. Phrases like "calmly inventive grace" and "geometrically inevitable" drift toward abstract declaration rather than character-specific thought. No dialogue to assess; filter verbs ("recognizing," "understanding," "knowing") occasionally dull immediacy but remain voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV held throughout with stable distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"collapsed star dust," "binding words," "topological field"—fitting a solitary herder steeped in cosmic obsession. Brief command "Hold" and final "I understand" provide tonal contrast. Perceptual signature is present: the protagonist sees visions, reads eel paths as geometries, interprets aurora as "borrowed hues." Minor slip: some constructions approach purple density ("burning like collapsed star dust in his skull") without quite obscuring clarity, and a few filter verbs ("he knew," "he had collected") are acceptable for voice but slightly dull immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register with rhythmic control and a perceptual signature rooted in photographic metaphor ("truth must be rarefied in darkness," "wet emulsion sliding from overexposed paper"). However, the diction occasionally drifts into workshop lyricism ("furiously tranquil resolve of the damned," "storm-kissed wonder") that feels more decorative than character-specific. POV remains stable and close, and the narrative distance is purposeful, but the voice lacks the idiosyncratic grain that would push it into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third on Aldric; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with some voice-specific texture ("fractured prism," "pneumatic precision"). However, perceptual signature is thin—Aldric's way of noticing does not feel philosopher-specific, and the mechanical arm is described externally ("whirred," "clicking") without interior sensation. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Silas's single exchange carries subtext. The peak duel beat uses filter constructs ("suggesting he intended," "knew to look") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains stable but does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV through Elias holds steady with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous fracture," "molt personalities monthly") that reads more authorial than character-bound, though the poetic lens justifies some lyricism. Dialogue pursues goals (Marcus asks for seeds, Elias admits the molt) but lacks subtext or friction—every exchange lands on mutual understanding without indirection. The prose rhythm varies but leans on repeated syntactic stems ("They worked," "They began," "Together they carried") in the final third without purposeful patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("the sound dissolved into the cloud-mist," "mourning turned melodic") that fits Elena's musical lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during technical problem-solving, slightly elevated during reflection on Maya. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. One friction: some diction leans toward elevated register ("repurposing memory into navigation," "strategically creative with grief") that, while voice-consistent, occasionally abstracts rather than grounds. The phrase "strategically creative" recurs as a label without always showing the contradictory impulses in action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout with no head-hopping. The prose attempts a lyric register ("empirically whimsical," "dreams became botany") that occasionally fits the fantastical premise but often drifts into elevated diction disconnected from Elara's lived urgency. Phrases like "mythological resonance" and "symbolic meaning" read as authorial meta-commentary rather than her perceptual signature. The dream-sequence with the grandmother shifts distance abruptly without clear markers, and the narrative certainty about the ridge's sentience exceeds what Elara's focalization can plausibly anchor. Dialogue with the grandmother is brief and functional but carries little subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filters all perception through Mara's craft-focused attention (magnifying lamp, wire, methodical slowness). The prose texture is distinctive in its marine and botanical diction ("ghost ship anchored in shallow water," "windswept cascade," "lunar pull"), and rhythmic control through longer, accumulative sentences matches the "rhythmically placid" attribute. Brief dialogue to the trees feels voice-consistent. However, register occasionally elevates beyond what a grief-stricken bonsai tutor would naturally think: phrases like "the cartography of reconciliation" and "the shifting spectrum of ocean meeting sky, the diffuse light of acceptance settling over everything" read more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature (seeing through craft and tidal metaphors) remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is stable, close-third, and filtered through Elara's distinctly lyrical perception ("moved through crowds like smoke"). The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, with a perceptual signature that shapes every description (e.g., interpreting flowers as code, seeing a portrait as a "frozen breath of time"). Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively with the tension of the heist and the stillness of the reflection. No head-hopping or distance issues.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, reflective, blending glassblower's precision with dramatic self-narration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (crisis-narrowed, phobia-attuned). Voice is consistent, though prose occasionally edges toward ornate density. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but functional and goal-driven in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature (“crystal whispering forecourt”) that modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping. Diction remains within Mara’s plausible lexicon; purposeful compression (the tickets’ meaning revealed through the lens) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    POV is stable, deeply embedded in Elara's perceptive signature, which fuses horticultural precision with metaphysical speculation. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with the ritual's cadence. Any elision (the nature of the "age after luck") is taught and paid off in the story's logic. The voice is singular and coherent from first line to last.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (mechanic's precision). Voice is consistent and poetic; dialogue minimal but natural. No head-hopping, and rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Close third-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elara's artistic sensibility. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with the scene's tension. No head-hopping; all elision (the ghost's history) is anchored in present stimuli and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct with lyrical, precise prose reflecting Elara's expertise and state. POV is stable close third-person; perceptual signature is selective (e.g., "anemometer's shadow stretched... like a finger"). No dialogue; elision is taught and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness," industrial decay rendered as "spine of some buried leviathan"). The voice modulates under pressure but maintains consistent rhythmic control and lexicon. Purposeful elision (Elias's absence) is taught and pays off in Mara's solo reckoning. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, meditative voice perfectly calibrated to the character's perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., "the drift of untold seasons") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited to Elara with lyrical, selective perception; consistent distance and rhythmic control; dialogue (single word) natural and charged, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)

    Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature tuned to vibration and touch. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, from numb opening to lyrical revelation. Purposeful compression ("the faint rustle of turning seasons") and patterned diction ("mirrored hush") are taught and pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct with a perceptual signature shaped by her profession (barometric shifts, atmospheric walls).

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Elias's studious, precise perception. POV is stable, single, and deeply embedded. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (e.g., shorter clauses as the lamp stutters). The perceptual signature—noticing the "weight of vanished things," the "pressure of minutes"—is unique and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, marrying scientific lexicon with lyric description in a way that feels plausibly Elena-specific. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and the perceptual signature—reading everything as data, equations, and observatories—is strong without slipping into generic “poetic” register. Occasional abstract formulations approach essay tone, but they don’t materially disrupt POV or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to a reflective, craft-focused protagonist. Diction like “steadily adaptive” and the extended metaphors of frost as map and canyon silence as part of her voice feel coherent with Mara’s sensibility and history with glass and fire. Psychic distance is well-controlled, slipping between observation and interiority without confusion. Occasionally the register tilts toward abstraction, but overall the perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in temperature, color, and bodily resonance instead of sound. Lexicon and rhythm support the lyrical, speculative tone and modulate appropriately toward a warmer, more expansive cadence at the end. There is some risk of the narration sounding more like an omniscient stylized essay than strictly Mara’s thought-stream, but the pattern is taught early and remains coherent. Overall, the voice feels controlled and memorable without lapsing into confusion or register whiplash.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrically confident, and clearly filtered through Marian’s sensibility as a weary, practical mystic of death. Syntax and rhythm vary in ways that match emotional shifts—from the pulsing, incantatory early lines to the calmer, declarative closure. The diction (“impossible space,” “geography that occupied the breath between moments”) feels of a piece, with no jarring register shifts or POV leakage. Even without dialogue, the narrative voice has a distinct texture and authority appropriate to a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyrical texture that matches Maya’s reflective but practical mindset. Diction and rhythm are varied and purposeful, and the single line of dialogue from the child feels natural and in-character. The narrative does not over-explain; it trusts images like the silent bell, breathing through walls, and the valley’s sealed edges to carry weight. While the voice is not radically idiosyncratic, its steadiness and modulation under pressure are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“foggy lucidity,” “pilgrim of sparks,” “circulatory system of capillary cracks”—that feels unified and controlled. POV distance remains stable and interior access is consistent; we never slip into other minds or omniscient explanation beyond what this kind of visionary narrator could plausibly frame. Rhythm modulates appropriately, lengthening around visionary description and tightening around breath counts and the climactic act. There is a slight sense of authorial lyricism outpacing Maya’s individual idiom at times, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently elevated, lyrical, and concept-driven, with a clear perceptual signature obsessed with geometry, botany, and temporality. Diction such as “rhizomatic intelligence,” “negative curvature,” and “palimpsest of temporal residue” fits a mind attuned to both horticulture and mathematics, so the register feels coherent rather than randomly ornate. Psychic distance stays fairly constant at a reflective, close-omniscient vantage aligned with Elias’s concerns. The tradeoff is that the voice sometimes prioritizes conceptual flourish over immediacy, which may slightly distance emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that fits Elara’s long, patient vigil and the quasi-mythic tone. Diction like “genetic memory of forests and fields” and “staggering grace” aligns with the heightened, solemn mood without obvious register slips. Interior access is controlled and filtered through concrete perception rather than abstract commentary, and the brief dialogue is clean and purposeful. The voice is distinctive and confident, even if it doesn’t quite achieve the startling idiosyncrasy of the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in acoustics and synesthesia (aurora as chords, silence as shape) and a steady close-third distance. Diction is consistently elevated but feels organic to Mara’s technical/artistic mind rather than imposed, and there’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm varies appropriately between long, lush descriptive sentences and tighter lines near crucial beats (imprinting, fitting the device). The voice maintains coherence under emotional pressure, enhancing rather than obscuring the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with strong rhythmic control and a distinctive perceptual palette (light, flowers, coded details). Phrasing like “moved through crowds like smoke” and “sister-truth” feels character-specific rather than generic. Occasionally the prose edges toward density, but it remains legible and aligned with Elara’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that plausibly reflects a contemplative craftsperson-poet: the blend of technical detail (silica at 1400 degrees) and theatrical declarations feels coherent. Her habit of narrating herself in mock-epic terms is a clear signature that modulates the otherwise elevated narration with playfulness. Psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At moments the diction edges toward literary omniscience rather than strictly her idiom, but it never breaks plausibility or control.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and largely convincing, with a good blend of sensory immediacy and reflective reach. Kai’s perceptual filter—obsessed with heights, rust, instability, and bodily reaction—gives the narration a distinct feel. There are occasional register spikes into clinical or abstract phrasing that feel slightly outside a panicked teen’s natural diction but not egregiously so. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a strong perceptual signature—mixing architectural, geological, and temporal metaphors in a consistent oracle-ish register. Third-person focalization stays tight to her worldview without head-hopping, and the diction (ambered hush, marbled hush, viscosity of silence) feels unified rather than opportunistically ornate. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well, with longer, baroque sentences handling reflection and shorter ones punching key realizations. A few abstract formulations slightly thin immediacy, but not enough to damage control.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, consistent techno-mystical register that suits the subject: “quantum processors,” “temporal engine,” and “looped timelines” sit comfortably alongside more lyrical metaphors. The perceptual signature—an almost clinical noticing of environment infused with emergent wonder—feels coherent for a sentient janitorial unit undergoing awakening. At times the narration drifts into authorial abstraction rather than experience filtered through Seven’s processing logic, especially in late thematic sentences. Still, rhythm and diction are generally well controlled and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice filtered through Mara has a distinct, lyrical texture, especially in its attention to sound and material surfaces; this perceptual signature remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (Julian’s fear, Mara’s non-accusatory stance) without over-explaining. The elevated diction is generally justified by the reflective, nocturnal mood, and POV boundaries stay clear. A few abstract phrases edge toward over-poetic generality, and the lens continuity slip mildly disrupts trust in the narrative’s control.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (e.g., “grams of chlorophyll,” “angles of thorns,” “probability dissolved into soil”). The third-person lens stays tightly aligned with Elara’s ritualistic, horticultural-ritual mindset, and the rhythm of sentences supports the meditative, accumulative structure. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance jumps. Occasionally the register leans toward essayistic abstraction, but it largely feels like part of the piece’s chosen idiom rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice maintains a consistent, lyrical yet precise SF register, marrying technical language (“coherent light projections,” “temporal drag”) with sensory metaphor. Kael’s perceptual signature—attuned to machinery, timekeeping, and the drakes’ patterns—feels stable and character-appropriate, even if a bit more elevated than a stereotypical mechanic. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose flowing, and the brief bit of dialogue is spare and effective. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; the voice is controlled and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture suited to a musician in a ruined opera house, with controlled, recognizably musical diction (“liquid harmonies,” “unstruck chords,” “resonating chamber”). POV is stable and modest in its knowledge, avoiding head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the voice maintains coherence even in more abstract moments. Occasionally the register edges toward ornate, but it remains legible and consistent with the chosen aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, with scientific lexicon (“isobars,” “logarithmic records,” “fault-tolerant oracle”) fused smoothly into heightened description. Diction and metaphor feel plausibly tied to a hyper-attentive, scientifically trained mind under strain, rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance and temporal control are steady as the narration moves between present perception and fever retrospection. The elevated register is consistent and intentional, though its intensity leaves little room for contrast or roughness that might further humanize the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s intellect and sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature (scientific/rational metaphors coexisting with industrial-gothic imagery). Lexicon and syntax stay believable for a thoughtful, skeptical explorer without slipping into alien academic register. Rhythmic modulation works: longer, sinuous sentences handle reflection while shorter, more concrete lines handle tactile engagements and realizations. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative stance never claims knowledge beyond Mara’s plausible inference.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is consistent, confident, and clearly filtered through the chronicle keeper’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature around time, decay, and softness vs. hardness. Syntax varies well and supports the meditative tone, and there is no POV leakage or confusing distance shift. Purposeful uncertainty (“stone to breathe,” “books to whisper”) is taught early and sustained, making the mild surrealism feel intentional. Occasionally the register edges toward generalized “cosmic” abstraction, but it does not break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person on Elara is stable and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice whose diction suits her reflective, experienced temperament. Rhythm and syntax vary nicely, with longer, image-rich sentences in calmer beats and more focused phrasing as pressure rises around the eclipse and Milo’s breakthroughs. The prose maintains a distinct perceptual signature (biological metaphors, attention to breath, roots, and music as process). Occasionally the register flirts with abstraction, but it remains coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction (“bronze quiet,” “New Stillness,” “mnemonically”) that suits an odd, scholarly historian in a numinous ruin. The narration blends external perception with interior inference smoothly, without unjustified omniscience or POV slips. Rhythms vary between long, rolling sentences for description and tighter ones at emotional pivots (her tears, the wall’s shudder), keeping it from becoming monotonous. The voice is elevated but coherent for this character and world, maintaining clarity despite a dense metaphorical load.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and lyrically inclined, with a clear perceptual bias toward metaphorical thinking about music and tides. Limited POV occasionally widens to near-omniscient knowledge of intelligence networks, but the stance remains controlled and tonally unified. Rhythms vary nicely and the diction suits a quasi-mythic treatment of a small realistic situation. Some abstractions edge toward essayistic, but they don’t significantly undercut the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinct in its metaphysical-technical register, well-suited to a “loop pedal priest” in a quantum-ritual cathedral. POV stays effectively with Elian while allowing a slightly elevated, almost liturgical diction that feels intentional rather than generic. Dialogue between Elian and the entity is stylized but coherent and clearly goal-driven, with rhetorical maneuvers embodied in their lines. Occasionally, the voice drifts into craft-lecture territory when naming devices (antimetabole, aporia), which risks sounding more like authorial display than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound, reflection, and pattern. Diction is elevated but fits Elias’s contemplative, quasi-mystical mindset and never drifts into a mismatched register. POV control is clean: no head-hopping, no unmotivated stance shifts, and interior access stays stable as intensity rises. The rhythmic modulation from hushed early sentences to more expansive climax prose is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrically charged, and well-suited to an introspective, high-concept speculative piece; diction like “periodically eternal” and “Archive of Frozen Moments” feels stylistically unified. The perceptual signature—dense metaphor, temporal and architectural imagery, recursive phrasing—stays coherent throughout and modulates slightly as pressure builds toward the descent. There is some drift toward abstract, essayistic explanation in places (e.g., “allowing the runes to algorithmically construct the path forward based on probability matrices”), which can thin the emotional immediacy. Nonetheless, POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close-third voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on vibration, texture, and sound-perceived-as-pressure. Mathew’s brief dialogue is economical and in-character, and the narrative diction fits the quasi-mythic, meditative tone. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between physical detail and conceptual reflection without confusion. At times the register edges toward the uniformly elevated, but it remains coherent with the chosen aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated, meteorological diction that feels plausible for a meticulous atmospheric scientist. Perception is distinctly filtered through Elara’s professional lens (barometric shifts in human behavior, storms circumventing pressure systems), giving the prose a clear perceptual signature. Rhythm varies and modulates appropriately with tension, from slow, careful movements to more abstract conceptual linking when she reads the message. There’s minimal register drift, and no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct sensory bias toward light and smell that feels true to Elias’s profession and obsession. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip or head-hop. A few lines verge on essayistic abstraction, but they don’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice is memorable and cohesive, supporting both the speculative elements and the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in the poet’s sensibility and obsessions. Syntax and diction are elevated but coherent, matching the cosmic/philosophical content without obvious register breaks. The narrative distance remains stable and close enough to feel like his mind filtering events, especially in how metaphors cluster around time, texture, and drafts. There’s no head-hopping or explanatory “helpful narrator” leakage; elision and abstraction feel intentional rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct acoustic sensibility that feels aligned to an “echo-harbor violinist” focalizer. Diction and rhythm are controlled, using recurring constructions (“magnificent simplicity,” “honor the broken”) as intentional motifs rather than unthinking tics. Psychic distance stays stable, neither head-hopping nor slipping into explanation-heavy omniscience, and the sentence music complements the thematic obsession with sound and silence. Occasional explicit abstractions (e.g., “processes arrested mid-transformation”) are noticeable but do not significantly disrupt the voice’s cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textural, and consistent, with a controlled elevated register that suits Kael’s meticulous, quasi-scientific sensibility (“synthetic sorrow and manufactured joy,” “resinous walls glowing with captured sunsets”). POV boundaries are respected; we stay inside Kael’s perception even while the client’s transformation is observed externally. Dialogue is stylized but coherent with the world and carries stakes and subtext (the client’s urgency, Kael’s careful caveats). Rhythm modulates nicely between lush description and more clipped, procedural beats at moments of action.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Elias while maintaining a slightly elevated, lyrical register that fits his liminal status between commerce and contemplation. Phrases like “boots heavy with the day's commerce, yet his eyes—whimsically attentive—already traced the constellations” show a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. There are no POV slips or jarring register jumps; even the more ornate sentences feel of a piece with the story’s aesthetic ambition. A few recurrent constructions and tagline-like formulations keep it just shy of the most rarefied tier, but the voice would be very competitive in literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lush texture with strong rhythmic and lexical control that matches the surreal setting. Diction (“luminescent ache,” “geometries that whispered of drowning and resurrection”) consistently reflects the story’s emotional register and world rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance stays relatively stable, with an omniscient-but-intimate vantage that never lapses into confusing head-hopping. At times, the elevated register risks over-saturation, but the pattern is taught early and sustained with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a clear perceptual signature: it foregrounds biology, physics, and time metaphors consistent with a naturalist who manipulates duration. Syntax and diction are controlled despite their richness; metaphors (“towers rose like fossilized vertebrae,” “acoustic womb”) feel curated rather than random. Psychic distance remains stable and appropriate, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge outside Elara’s frame. At times the lyrical register approaches uniform intensity, which slightly blunts modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctively lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in geometry, craft, and mineral/organic imagery. Diction is elevated but coherent with a contemplative, ritualistic scene, and it modulates gently as pressure builds around the droplet moment and realization. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; interior access and narration align smoothly. A slight tendency toward abstract phrases (“calculus of hope,” “mathematics of emotion”) is stylistic rather than sloppy, but keeps it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyric-technical texture (e.g., “pipe chases that ran like arteries beneath the reading rooms above”) that fits Maya’s methodical, infrastructural life. Psychic distance is controlled, blending her perceptions with gentle narrative compression without head-hopping or stance slips. Diction feels plausibly within the orbit of a reflective, library-adjacent maintenance worker, if slightly elevated for literary effect, and the rhythm modulates well between description and interior reflection. The voice could lean a touch more idiosyncratically into Maya’s personal idiom to push it into truly singular territory.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and character-specific, blending scientific precision (“temperature regulators, calibrated nutrient drips”) with lyric intuition in a way that feels apt for a meticulous botanist undergoing a shift. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with well-paced long, sinuous sentences for reflection and crisper ones at key turns (“Yet perfection had become a cage.”). The metaphoric texture (“glass cathedral of domination,” “sincerity no longer routed through the labyrinth of academic distance”) coheres as a single perceptual signature. Occasionally phrases like “circuitously sincere clarity” brush against self-conscious abstraction, but they do not break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm that suit a reflective, weary, sharply observant protagonist. Elara’s perception (“water wars had taught survivors to read landscape as grammar”) is character-colored rather than generic, and Maren’s dialogue has a different, more brusque cadence that still carries shared exhaustion. POV is stable and distance is well modulated, moving smoothly between close sensory focus and broader reflection. The elevated diction feels intentional and fitting for literary mode rather than incongruent with the character.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third POV on Elara is stable and persuasive; her perceptions and lexicon match her role as a practiced interpreter of resonance. The prose has a distinctive, slightly elevated lyric texture that remains controlled, with the pilgrim’s brief dialogue carrying a different, layered timbre. Psychic distance is well-managed, tightening around key beats without confusing who knows what. A few abstract phrases in the final reflection slightly thin the otherwise strong perceptual specificity, but not enough to disrupt voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Kael’s reflective, image-rich sensibility; metaphors like “cartographer mapping invisible coastlines” feel character-rooted rather than generic. Diction and rhythm modulate well between description, visionary surges, and quiet dialogue, giving the piece a distinct music without sacrificing clarity. The brief dialogue lines are clean and natural for the setting and generation, and the narrative never slips into omniscience or head-hopping. A minor quibble is that some abstract formulations at the end edge toward essayistic register, but they stay just within the bounds of the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and distinct, blending technical diction (“calibrated eye,” “subway gradients”) with poetic turns in a way that matches Elara’s analytically artistic mind. POV remains stable and disciplined; we never slip outside her frame of knowledge, and the narrative confidence fits her practiced observational skill. Some lines lean toward overtly writerly abstraction, but the rhythm and imagery are generally purposeful rather than showy. Under peak beats (the punch, the boarding), the prose tightens enough to maintain clarity while preserving texture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent with the quasi-mystical scientific frame, maintaining a stable psychic distance around Mara. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a clear perceptual signature that notices both technical detail and emotional resonance. There is no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue is natural and in-character. At times the register tips toward abstraction, but it generally serves the intended tone rather than fighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated, cosmic diction that matches Kael’s age and the grandeur of the setting, and the point of view never wavers. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with a good mix of long, lyric sentences and shorter emphatic beats at key moments (e.g., the fragment shattering). A few phrases verge on generic-poetic (“wasteland of eternal years,” “uncaring void”), but overall the perceptual signature—seeing planes, magnetic lines, and possibilities—is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending clinical/mathematical diction with sensory, almost gothic imagery. The narrative distance remains stable, and the language choices feel plausibly anchored in Maya’s analytical yet morally preoccupied mind. There is some tendency toward high-concept abstraction, but it generally feels like character-inflected thought rather than authorial intrusion. No head-hopping or stance slippage undermines the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinctive, confident lyricism—phrases like “roots gripping stone like frozen lightning” and “hands moved with incandescent restraint” feel of a piece with Elias’s sensibility. Psychic distance is consistent and well-chosen: close enough for textured interior perception, distant enough to sustain the mythic tone of the situation. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative stance doesn’t over-explain; it trusts image and rhythm. At times the diction edges toward uniform grandness, which very slightly flattens modulation under peak pressure, but control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is assured, lyrically dense, and consistently filtered through the archivist’s unusual sensory lens, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm feel controlled, with long, winding sentences used deliberately to echo accumulation and tide rhythms. Diction is coherent and free of register slips, and the narrative distance stays stable. It does not quite reach 9+ because the uniform, high-lyric register flattens modulation—there are few sharp shifts in rhythm or distance to mark structural turns.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent in register, with a clear perceptual signature (scientific skeptic haunted by mythic imagery). Syntax and rhythm are well controlled; longer, flowing sentences suit the reflective, one-night interior crisis. Diction—“ephemeral compass,” “gloomy cheerfulness,” “architecture of understanding”—leans elevated but fits her intellectual background and the story’s mythic frame. The voice avoids head-hopping and maintains a stable distance even as it leans into lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon that blends poetic metaphor (“heartbeat before the scalpel”) and corporate jargon (“underutilized verticality”) filtered through Maya’s sensibility. POV boundaries are clear and stable; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, with longer, lush sentences for atmosphere and sharper ones for turning points, like the juggler recognizing the tag. The voice stays plausibly within Maya’s educated, liminal standpoint without jarring register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well matched to a scientifically literate, reflective protagonist; terms like “impact melt” and “stratigraphic data” sit naturally alongside more poetic images. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively from technical preparation to the almost religious tone of the “cathedral of gold and obsidian” moment at dawn. There’s no POV drift or unearned omniscience; the limited knowledge and focus feel believable. The prose texture is distinct enough that it reads as a particular consciousness rather than generic SF narration.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and controlled, with strong sensory bias that reflects Mira’s blindness and compensatory skills (vibration, sound, thermal patterns). Diction and rhythm are lyrically elevated yet consistent with the quasi-steampunk/retro-tech milieu and her professional expertise. The narrative distance is stable, and the descriptive flourishes generally feel like her way of apprehending the world rather than authorial overlay. Under pressure, the voice remains clear and doesn’t devolve into vague abstraction or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, slightly ornate, and very consistent with an erudite atlas editor—phrases like “render the unseeable into grid lines and legend” feel character-driven rather than generic. POV discipline is clean; we never leave Marlow’s perspective, and the lone line of dialogue fits his dry authority. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences balanced by shorter, declarative ones at key turns (“He would have to walk there, of course…”). The voice could arguably modulate a bit more under peak pressure, but its steadiness also suits Marlow’s temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct texture of sound-related metaphors and measured, almost ritualistic syntax that suits Elara’s work. Diction remains cohesive and does not slip into jarring registers, and the distance—slightly mythic but still anchored in concrete perception—fits the allegorical bent. Rhythmic modulation (from stately description to more kinetic phrasing as her pace quickens) is well controlled. The main limitation is that the elevated, ceremonial tone flattens psychological nuance, contributing to Elara’s archetypal feel.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated register that suits both SF and mythic undertones. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and Elara’s professional perspective—gauges, currents, preservation field—colors the diction in believable ways alongside the more poetic turns. Repetition of key phrases (“gathered hush,” “lonesome splendor,” “unsnarl”) reads as intentional motif rather than verbal tic, though it edges close to overuse at times. Rhythmic modulation between longer, flowing sentences and tighter, pressure-marking lines generally tracks the emotional shifts cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct texture built from phrases like “narrative physics,” “abandoned sanctity,” and “copperlight repose.” Diction and syntax match the slightly archaic, fable-adjacent tone and accord with a character who thinks in story-structures. POV control is tight—no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience beyond the story-logic of an accumulative, mythic narrator. At times the elevated register risks slight over-lushness, but rhythm and stance remain controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is lyrically gothic with a consistent texture—“honey wrapped around broken glass,” “ash veil trailing like smoke”—and maintains a stable focalization around Eira/Julian without head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and psychic distance modulation (from broad mythic framing to close sensation of pain and breath) tracks emotional beats well. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext about power and debt without over-explaining. Occasionally the narrative register leans a bit more authorially omniscient than Julian’s likely inner lexicon, but the mythic tone makes that choice feel coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is distinctive, with a consistent sensory palette and metaphoric logic that feels tailored to Maren’s hybrid sea/canyon life. Diction like “orchid solace,” “filigree patterns,” and “tapestry of movement” builds a recognizable narrative signature without losing control of meaning. Psychic distance stays stable; we are close enough to feel motive yet far enough for mythic framing. Minor repetition and high-register abstraction in places keep it from absolute top-band, but the voice is publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara notices time, bone, and root. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, using long, sinuous sentences to match the wandering and a solemn, incantatory tone that suits the material. Lexicon choices (“cautious enchantment,” “genetic memory,” “patient architecture”) feel coherent for this slightly elevated, mythic register. Minor repetition of constructions and favored adjectives hints at pattern rather than mar it, but a touch more variation would make the voice feel less self-similar over the whole span.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person narration is stable and confident, with a distinct lyrical-technical texture that suits the speculative setting and Kael’s craft. Diction choices like “digital panopticon,” “surface mail,” and “cathedral to tactile experience” feel intentional and cohesive rather than randomly elevated. The perceptual signature—attention to physical substrates, margins, and old machines—is strong and consistent. At times the voice risks feeling slightly more essayistic than embodied, but it never breaks POV coherence or obscures action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s contemplative, pattern-oriented mind, with metaphors grounded in textiles, astronomy, and acoustics. POV control is clean—no head-hopping, no unexplained access—and the few lines of dialogue are efficient, subtext-rich, and character-distinguishing (her apparent babble vs. the captain’s concise questions). Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-fantastical court setting and her specialized role, and the prose modulates appropriately at the climax without losing texture. A slight risk of over-ornamentation remains, but it doesn’t materially blur perspective or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close-third voice is lyrically charged yet coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature (cathedral, sacred, aquatic and temporal metaphors). Diction and syntax feel controlled and intentional, modulating toward more concentrated intensity at the climax without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the mystical register matches Elara’s profession and world. The elevated language rides the edge of over-richness but generally serves mood and character rather than sounding generic-poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility as an interpreter surrounded by war. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, with a distinct rhythmic texture that suits the contemplative, high-literary aim. The narrative distance is stable and well-managed; free-indirect moments (“she had performed the truest translation”) feel owned by Mara’s perspective rather than authorial intrusion. There are occasional elevated formulations that verge on essayistic, but they mostly stay on the right side of voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lush, metaphor-rich, and consistent with a sensitive, visually oriented artist in a liminal state. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, winding sentences matching the dream-texture without losing clarity. Diction (“fold of a daydream,” “knowledge network,” “chemical exposure that life had interrupted”) feels unified and intentional. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the modulation from somber to quietly exultant is managed smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly tuned to an observant, sensory-intellectual artist; diction like “physics made intimate” feels character-appropriate. The narration maintains a stable stance and psychic distance, smoothly interleaving perception, concept, and minimal exposition. Rhythms modulate well between longer lyric sentences and tighter declarative ones, especially around key shifts (speaking into the reflector, approaching the wall). There’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition, and the slightly elevated register feels earned by the protagonist and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with controlled syntactic variety that suits the speculative-literary mode. POV is mostly close third on Elias with some omniscient coloration, but the stance doesn’t slip confusingly. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, carrying subtext via the coded agricultural small talk. At times the diction feels more like an authorial essayist than Elias’s filtered perception, but the blend is coherent for this style.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with recurring phrases (“shyly unstoppable,” “off-key wind,” “reef-shadow joy”) creating a strong pattern without becoming mechanical. POV stance is consistent, occupying a close but mythic third-person that suits the fable-like structure. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the diction—“photosynthesize pain,” “architecture of the blossom armistice”—feels organic to this specific narrator. At times the register verges on ornate, but it retains clarity and a stable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyrical voice is consistent and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature (“clouds that remembered rain,” “volumes that tasted of emotions humanity had ceased to feel”). Diction and rhythm suit a solitary, ritual-bound caretaker in a baroque fantastical library, and modulation under pressure (during the light-summoning) remains clear. There is no dialogue to test, but interior and narrative language cohere. The lushness occasionally risks monotony in cadence, which softens the sense of intensification at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with an erudite arcane linguist, with metaphors and diction that feel character-appropriate rather than generically elevated. The narrative rhythm modulates well, lingering on ritual detail and tightening around Julian’s entrance. Dialogue is sparse but carries clear subtext and history in very few lines. There is minor risk of conceptual phrasing (“method of interconnected promises,” “symphony of truth”) feeling slightly essayistic, but it remains integrated with the world’s magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lush, slightly elevated diction that still largely matches a highly competent, reflective machinist. Technical terms and metaphors blend into a distinct perceptual signature—he sees the world through tools, materials, and system behavior. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with long, flowing sentences suiting the contemplative, accumulative mode. At times, the register becomes so ornate and abstract that it feels more like an essayistic narrator than Elias’s mind, creating a small but noticeable distance at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature grounded in dust, paper, and avian motion. Syntax and diction modulate well between more meditative lines and the slightly tauter moments around Orion’s release, without losing coherence. There is no dialogue to test conversational texture, but the narrative stance feels unified with Elara’s sensibility and never drifts into expository omniscience. Overall, the voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature—scientific and mystical registers braided together. Syntax varies enough to sustain rhythm, and metaphor choices are internally coherent with the world’s logic (weather as architecture, wood as memory). Psychic distance stays stable; we never slip outside Elara’s frame of perception, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated stance change. A tendency toward density and abstraction in some sentences may limit immediacy for some readers but does not compromise control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—phrases like “shadowseam wonder” and “cadence encoded in stone and starlight” feel both character-specific and tonally unified. POV is stable and modest, without unjustified omniscience, and the few lines of dialogue are simple but effective, carrying subtext (loneliness, awe, invitation to connection). Rhythmic control is strong; sentence music supports the meditative pressure without becoming murky. A slight tendency toward overt thematic phrasing at the end is the only thing holding this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close/limited voice is stable, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and a distinct, poetic lexicon that matches the surreal setting. Recurrent phrases and cadences (“scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird,” “before memory fades”) build a recognizable texture even if they occasionally veer toward self-conscious repetition. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyrical mode is taught from the first line and sustained through the end. Greater modulation of rhythm and a bit more grounded, character-specific noticing would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct analytic-poetic texture that fits Kael’s persona (“variables formed an equation,” “orchestrated serendipity”). Diction and rhythm are consistent and mostly plausible for a hyper-observant, somewhat metaphysical performer. Occasional elevated abstractions (“chaos mathematics,” “static drone”) flirt with authorial overlay but do not break the POV. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates smoothly from observation to ritual to reflective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person lyric voice is distinctive, with recurring diction (“obsidian grace,” “twilight garden,” “tide’s ghost”) that creates a recognizable perceptual signature. Psychic distance is steady, and the narrative stance feels plausibly aligned with a highly poetic focalizer. At times the register drifts toward abstract or thesis-like (“cosmic memory operated on different statutes”), which briefly breaks the spell of embodied voice. Still, control is generally strong and consistent, with purposeful rhythm and image-driven narration.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture and a professional perceptual bias (reading cracks, glass, light behavior). Diction like “noctilucent reckonings” and “clear complexity” gives the prose a memorable, quasi-technical music that fits his vocation, though occasionally it feels more literary-authorial than naturally character-bound. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or distance confusion, and modulation from hushed pre-dawn to prismatic climax is well-controlled. The main limitation is a slight uniformity of high register that flattens some emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice centered on Maya is consistent and assured, with a lyrical but controlled cadence that suits her reflective, exhausted professionalism. Elevated diction (“arithmetic of loss,” “resonant reconfiguration of innocence”) generally feels like the narrative’s stylized lens rather than an implausible intrusion for the character. Dialogue is spare and functional, carrying subtext (Elias’s shame, Maya’s refusal of platitude) while advancing the emotional action. There is no head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately around crucial images and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent in its elevated, quasi-philosophical register, matching the story’s speculative-intellectual premise. POV control is clean; we stay with Elara’s lens even when the language leans toward omniscient abstraction. Recurrent phrasal and rhythmic patterns feel deliberate rather than mechanical, giving the piece a distinct texture. The main limitation is that voice sometimes sounds more like a detached essayist than Elara’s particular consciousness, which slightly flattens character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lucid, and suitably lyrical, with a distinct contemplative texture fitting Mara’s profession and the story’s elegiac mood. Diction and syntax are consistent and controlled; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narration slips toward essayistic theme-stating, but it doesn’t fully break the established voice. Overall, the perceptual signature—attuned to echoes, silence, and residue—is coherent and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The omniscient-lyric voice is consistent, confident, and texturally distinct, with controlled repetition (“prism parapet after rain,” “perceptively calm”) that feels patterned rather than accidental. Diction (“coded lullabies,” “spatial logic,” “hidden mathematics”) suits a mythic-fantastical register and rarely drifts into explanatory flatness. POV handling is clean—no head-hopping, and the limited access to Elias’s interiority feels intentional to maintain his mirage-like quality. Under pressure (bells, fading heartbeat), the voice maintains rhythm without getting cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and colored by Elara’s long exposure to war and diplomacy, giving the prose a reflective, weary authority. Diction and rhythm feel intentional without slipping into academic or corporate register, and the repeated phrases around celestial motion and ritual function as motifs rather than crutches. Dialogue is slightly elevated but sits comfortably with the quasi-mythic frame and maintains distinctions between Elara’s measured softness, the general’s bitterness, and the child’s simplicity. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent, supporting both clarity and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically elevated, and consistent with Elias’s intellect and aestheticized amorality. Sentence rhythm varies well, with long, sinuous descriptive lines balanced by shorter, declarative pivots at key beats. The diction and metaphors feel of a piece, giving the prose a distinct texture without slipping into incompatible registers or head-hopping. It’s a strong, coherent narrative voice that could comfortably sit in a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature that blends sensual detail and abstract thought in a way that feels native to Lys’s world and status. Diction (“bodily poetic,” “temporal filaments,” “spectral geometry”) is elevated but coherent with the fantasy register, and the psychic distance stays steady in a close third. The narrative doesn’t cheat on knowledge or hop POV, and patterned phrases feel like intentional motifs rather than scaffolding. At times the lushness risks homogeneity of rhythm, but control remains high and the pattern is clearly taught and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, with a distinctive, slightly baroque lyricism that suits an “urbane calligrapher” steeped in aesthetics and precision. Metaphors like “rearranged listeners’ memories like furniture in a dark room” and “half-lit epiphanies” feel character-appropriate rather than authorially imposed. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping into reflective abstraction only when the scene can bear it. A mild uniformity of elevated register across all moments keeps it from feeling absolutely effortless, but the voice remains confident and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistently aligned with an “esoteric realist” sensibility, blending scientific and mystical registers in a way that feels character-true rather than generic-poetic. Diction choices like “metaphysical weight of extinction,” “arithmetic of loss,” and “grammar of remembrance from impermanence” create a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable, with occasional slight zoom-outs that remain clearly tethered to Elara’s worldview. There’s minimal exposition and no POV leakage, and the rhythmic modulation between long, flowing sentences and shorter emphatic ones generally serves the meditative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong preference for metaphor linked to craft, ice, and light that feels organically tied to Elara’s worldview. Third-person limited focalization is steady and free of leakage; the narrator’s knowledge and diction match the quasi-mythic, artisan context. Rhythmic control is generally good, with sentences varying in length and cadence to support the accumulative, incantatory feel. Occasionally, the density of figurative language risks blurring edges between images, but not enough to seriously damage legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, textural, and clearly inflected by this specific character’s perception—scientific remnants, ritual, and forest all seen through a single sensibility. Diction is controlled and rhythmic, with patterned phrases like “precisely playful” functioning as intentional motifs rather than tics. Psychic distance stays stable, and the lyric compression never drifts into confusion. Occasional abstract formulations brush against essayistic commentary, but they don’t materially disrupt the voice’s coherence or authority.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and colored by an astronomer’s conceptual lexicon, giving the piece a distinct texture. Diction like “empirically ironic” pushes toward a more modern register but fits the stylized, mythic-narrative stance. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching the meditative tone and tightening appropriately near the climax. There’s no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture (“shifting grace,” “cathedral coded into DNA”) that matches the metaphysical premise. POV control is solid: we stay inside Elias’s perceptual frame, with no head-hopping and no unjustified omniscience. The rhythm of the sentences is generally well modulated, moving from dense description to slightly leaner action at the climax. Some abstraction and repeated high-register phrasing risk a uniform tone, but it still reads as a deliberate stylistic choice rather than muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is assured, lyrically consistent, and clearly colored by Elias’s sensibilities as a maker of mirrors and glass. Lexicon and sentence rhythm feel controlled rather than haphazard, with recurring syntactic patterns that support the ritualistic mood instead of flattening it. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or register missteps. If anything, the voice could stand a touch more idiosyncratic grit to avoid reading as generically “fantasy-elevated,” but at this level it is still highly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical awareness (stress fractures, water damage, grafting) and lyrical metaphor. POV control is steady; we never slip outside Mara’s frame, and reflective passages remain anchored in concrete present stimuli (the trees, the ribbon, the tools). Rhythms vary well, and the diction—while elevated and occasionally dense—is plausibly aligned with a seasoned craftsperson given to inward reflection. At a prestige level, the voice edges toward explaining its own wisdom rather than trusting implication, but it remains clear, textured, and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and well-suited to the material: lyrical, slightly elevated, and comfortable with metaphysical diction. The narrative stance stays tightly bound to Elara’s perceptions and thought patterns, with no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in distance. Syntax and rhythm show conscious control, especially in the more incantatory cadences around the bathroom and orchard descriptions. The main constraint is a mild sameness of register—highly abstract and ornate even in moments that might benefit from sharper, plainer phrasing—which limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to an erudite arcane linguist in a baroque fantastical library—elevated diction feels earned rather than affected. Patterns of perception (seeing language in gaps, structure in fungi and flowers) clearly belong to Elara’s mind and give the narration a distinct texture. There are no POV slips or unmotivated shifts in stance, and the modulation from description to conceptual reflection is smooth. The voice could feel even more singular with a few sharper idiosyncrasies or emotional tics under stress, but it is already strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and lyrically charged, with a clear perceptual signature that blends the surreal and the concrete (“planks becoming pages, fog becoming ink”). The third-person focalization stays steady through Maya, and the elevated diction feels appropriate to the mythic, dreamlike register. Abstract phrases like “unkindled solace” and “blissfully aberrant” are integrated into the established style rather than reading as stray flourishes. There is some risk of uniform high-register density, but it does not cause confusion or break the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently controlled, with a distinctive, slightly academic-lyric register befitting an archivist engaged in temporal metaphysics. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but not incoherent, and metaphors (rope as “three-dimensional manuscript,” “clockwork of causality”) feel thematically apt. Psychic distance stays stable in a third-person-close that privileges Elara’s professional lens without head-hopping. At times the abstraction density edges toward uniformity, but overall the voice is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sound and pattern (“interference patterns,” “null-song,” “hammered repose”). Diction and rhythm are lyrically elevated but feel in-character for this myth-science world, and the narrative stance does not wobble or leak other viewpoints. There is effective modulation from tempestuous imagery to calmer, more measured cadences as the hush forms. While not formally experimental, the voice is distinct and controlled enough to stand out in a competitive field.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-close voice is confident and consistent, with a lush, slightly archaic lyricism that suits the ruined-civilization setting and Elara’s reflective disposition. Phrasing like “language written in probability” and “a shard of hush expanding outward” creates a distinct perceptual signature, and psychic distance is controlled, staying anchored in her perceptions even during visionary sequences. The narrative doesn’t over-explain, instead trusting sensory-metaphoric cues to carry interior state and world logic. A touch of high-register abstraction creeps in toward the end, but it doesn’t break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly Elara-colored in its attention to storms, geometry, and archival process. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a distinct rhythm that supports the contemplative, speculative tone without slipping into abstraction. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving fluidly between close perception and slightly more panoramic statements, yet always grounded in her perspective. There are no POV leaks or register breaks that disrupt the spell, and the patterned phrasing (e.g., recurring “she…” openings) reads as intentional cadence rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct lexicon (“ambient awareness,” “gravity of hopelessness,” “serious playfulness”) that matches the character’s hybrid of ritual technician and mystic. POV is stable and confident; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative distance stays consistent while allowing occasional, voice-appropriate abstractions. Rhythm varies well across sentences, and the elevated diction feels intentional rather than intrusive. At times the repeated conceptual phrasing risks slight sameness, but it doesn’t break immersion or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: metaphor choices and attentional bias fit someone deeply attuned to environment and to Maya’s observational habits. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-bearing, especially in how Maya sidesteps the question and how the narrator repositions his demand. The register is elevated yet coherent for this reflective, intimate scene, and psychic distance is stable. At times the narrator’s diction (“conceptual repricing”–style abstractions) approaches essayistic, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled lyrical register (“xenial trellis,” “intangible tangible essence of absolute stillness”) that feels consistent with Mara’s interiority. Syntax and rhythm modulate appropriately, lengthening for contemplative description and tightening as the clock runs down. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; everything is filtered through Mara’s experiential lens. The elevated diction occasionally approaches uniformity, but it remains coherent rather than drifting into alien register.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s sensibility—attuned to instruments, atmosphere, and abstract acoustic concepts. Phrases like “negative three decibels, creating a vacuum of audio that felt like drowning in velvet” show a distinct perceptual signature. The single line of dialogue lands with quiet authority and aligns with the narrative’s cadence. At times the diction slides toward high abstraction (“calcified architecture of regret”), but it generally remains coherent with the established elevated, quasi-mystical register.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the genre: it balances lyricism with clear exposition in a unified register. The diction (“quantum superposition,” “prismatic spray,” “neural monocle”) fits both Elara’s world and her professional role as lore keeper, preserving plausibility. Sentences vary in rhythm and structure, and free-indirect shading (“wisely adventurous”) feels like an organic blend of narrator and character rather than head-hopping. Occasionally the voice drifts toward generalized abstraction (“treasures greater than any kingdom could offer”) which slightly flattens specificity, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture (“tender shadow keeper,” “architecture of absence”) that matches the mythic-psychological mode. POV is stable around Elias while still allowing limited access to Mira’s experience at key beats, and dialogue sounds heightened but fitting for the register. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and motifs recur in a controlled way. At times the elevated diction risks distancing us from the immediacy of their pain, but it never fully tips into self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive blend of technical terms and mystical diction that matches Maya’s history and the speculative premise. Patterns like “virtuously mischievous” and the pyramid/pressure lexicon feel like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic prose. The narrative stance stays tightly in her conceptual frame—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience—and modulation from anxious, buzzing accumulation to calmer, charged poise at the end is well handled. Occasionally the abstraction level rises enough to skim over immediate sensation, but it doesn’t break control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct palette of “golden,” “sepia,” and resonance imagery that feels controlled rather than random. Diction is elevated but stable, and POV access stays with Kael without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. Some lines step slightly away from Kael’s personal lexicon toward an authorial essayistic tone, yet the overall perceptual signature—acoustic geometry, dust constellations, documentation-as-weapon—remains coherent. Rhythm varies reasonably, avoiding mechanical cadences even while leaning heavily on ornate clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinct, marrying quasi-scientific precision (“measurable starlight,” “registered by instruments”) with mystic lyricism. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but feel justified by Valen’s austere, obsessive mind and the story’s conceptual ambitions. Psychic distance stays controlled; we inhabit his perceptions and drives without POV slippage. Rhythmic modulation—long, baroque sentences easing into slightly sharper beats at the door—supports the accumulative, ritualistic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, intelligent, and consonant with Maya’s role and temperament, with sustained metaphoric framing (geology, archaeology, archives) that feels character-driven. Diction is elevated but plausible for an introspective, educated social worker, and the narrative distance stays steady without head-hopping. Rhythms vary and the lyricism never fully overwhelms clarity. There’s a mild sameness of register across the whole piece, which slightly blunts modulation under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident and textured, with an archivist’s sensibility in its attention to documents, obsolete tech, and precise mechanisms. Diction and rhythm are elevated but consistent, supporting the quasi-mythic tone without slipping into a register that feels alien to the protagonist. Phrases like “coded freedom,” “patient as justice,” and “luminous defiance” may verge on grandiose, yet they’re thematically consonant and pattern-taught early. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond a controlled, retrospective framing about “years later.”

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is distinctively lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in how it notices absences, intervals, and refracted light. Diction (“vested hush,” “un-sound,” “negative space”) is consistent with the story’s conceptual register and doesn’t slip into expository flatness. Rhythm generally modulates well with pressure; sentences lengthen for atmosphere and tighten around key beats like the suspended dewdrop. A few repeated constructions and coined terms flirt with self-consciousness, but they operate as deliberate patterning rather than mechanical filler.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is consistent, richly textured, and clearly tied to Elias’s perceptions and lexicon (botanical, archival, reverent). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with long, lush sentences fitting the contemplative pressure and shorter, clearer beats handling pivotal actions (prodding the bark, rearranging monuments). Lyric diction (“mossy delight,” “the sound of moss growing on stone”) feels purposeful rather than mannered in this world. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with a distinct diction that suits a patient, mechanically-minded protagonist and a slightly heightened, literary register. Metaphors (e.g., “time itself could stall in a mechanism's wounded heart,” “maps were fictions drawn by the optimistic”) feel character-inflected rather than generic. Psychic distance is stable, and there is no head-hopping or register confusion. The rhythm modulates effectively between descriptive calm and higher-pressure movement across the stones.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident and distinctive, blending scientific and mystical registers in a way that feels organic to an obsessive alchemist (“kilograms of intention,” “conservation of soul-mass”). POV is stable and focalization stays with Elara’s knowledge and lexicon, even when the prose turns abstract. Rhythms are mostly well-controlled, with long, lush sentences that suit the reflective, ceremonial mode. At moments, density of elevated diction risks slight distance from her embodied grief, but it never breaks legibility or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled imagery and a clear perceptual signature centered on sound and light. Syntax varies well, and the register matches the mythic, solemn-yet-gentle mood. Dialogue is sparse but natural and thematically pointed. Occasional abstract phrases (“luminous ache,” “modestly fearless”) are just on the safe side of over-crafted and do not disrupt the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, blending clinical, mathematical, and sensory diction in a way that matches Elena’s altered nervous system and the SF context. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with long, rolling sentences that suit the lyric-analytic mode. At times, terminology like “proprioceptive map” and “algorithm” risks feeling a hair abstract or academic, but here it mostly reads as diegetic to her enhancement rather than authorial intrusion. POV is stable and reliably anchored in her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and texturally distinct, comfortably sustaining lyrical abstraction alongside tactile specificity. Diction and syntax feel plausibly matched to Elara’s role as a between-worlds translator, with recurring phrases (“eternal instant,” “elusively tangible”) functioning as deliberate leitmotifs rather than tics. Psychic distance is well-managed, sliding between external action and dense interior perception without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance carries the piece with controlled rhythm and clear focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctively textured, blending technical lexicon (“governor mechanism,” “mainspring barrel”) with lyrical description. Maya’s perceptual signature—reading dust, fractures, and machinery as language—shapes what the narrative notices and how it’s framed. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping; even conceptual statements feel plausibly filtered through her mechanistic worldview. At times the diction skirts the edge of being a bit too elevated/essayistic for an in-scene consciousness, but it never breaks coherence or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and metaphoric logic tied to printing, glass, frost, and clouds. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is well-controlled, hovering in a close-but-not-intimate range that suits the mythic tone. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the voice modulates slightly as pressure rises toward the rupture. It’s strong and distinctive, though the uniform loftiness occasionally flattens emotional texture rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically dense but controlled, with a clear perceptual signature that blends Kaelen’s sensibility with an elevated narrative stance. Diction like “archaeology of forgiveness” and “sorrow burnished bright enough to guide ships through the dark” is consistent with his poetic inclination and the setting’s baroque quality, avoiding register shocks. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from reflective to quietly urgent during storms and the council scene works well. A few abstract phrases could be slightly more grounded in bodily or sensory experience, but overall the voice is distinctive and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is a controlled third-person lyricism with a distinct mythic-technician flavor, full of material detail (gears, combs, mainspring) blended with metaphysical stakes. Diction and cadence stay consistent—elevated but not academic—and match Elias’s vocation and the story’s quasi-sacred frame. There is no dialogue, but the internal narrative rhythm modulates appropriately as midnight presses closer, with longer, more incantatory sentences during the ritual. POV remains stable and modest in scope, never leaking into knowledge beyond what the narrator’s chosen stance plausibly conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, blending technical concreteness (“calcite deposits,” “bioluminescence”) with a sensuous, mystical register that clearly belongs to someone who lives through scent and geology. Psychic distance is well controlled: we move smoothly between fine external detail and her interior realizations without head-hopping or confusion. Occasional elevated abstractions feel more like character-colored narration than generic authorial intrusion. The rhythmic control and lexis are strong enough to carry the lyric mode without collapsing into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—lyric but controlled—and stays firmly anchored in Mara’s artisan-centered perception. Recurring phrases like “turbine-hum reverie,” “timewoven alliances,” and “perpetually learning” give the piece a recognizable cadence, even if they verge on prompt-echo. The register is elevated yet plausible for a reflective artist in extremis, and POV remains stable and reliable. Some repetitions of phrasing and explicit thesis-statements slightly blunt the edge of the voice, keeping it short of truly distinctive mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and congruent with Lyra’s sensibility as an artist—sensory-rich but controlled. The focalization stays cleanly with her perceptions and inferences; the sexton’s brief dialogue feels natural and functional rather than expository intrusion. Diction is consistently elevated yet believable for this character and mode, and the rhythm modulates gently with seasonal and emotional shifts. There is some sameness of high-register lyricism across beats, but it suits the contemplative design and never confuses POV.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control and a distinctive lexicon. Sentences often layer physical, psychic, and temporal registers in a way that feels intentional rather than muddled. There are a few moments where the diction shifts toward essayistic abstraction, but it generally remains plausibly within a heightened literary narration tracking a reflective archivist. No POV leakage or tense instability undermines the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinctive—elevated, dense, and metaphysically inflected—and remains consistent throughout, with a clear third-person-close vantage anchored in Elara. Phrases like “impossible topology,” “neural architectures of remembrance,” and “Post-Wish Age” feel of a piece with the story’s invented metaphysics and alchemical-intellectual frame. At times, the register approaches academic abstraction, which slightly distances us from embodied urgency, but the rhythmic and lexical control remains high and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent and persuasive, with a distinct texture (“velvet disquiet,” “cartography…of longing and fear”) that clearly belongs to this character and world. The diction’s slightly elevated, mystical register matches Elias’s archaic profession and mindset and never lapses into expository flatness. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between concrete sensation and abstract realization without confusing focalization. At times the prose edges toward lushness that could, in a longer piece, risk self-consciousness, but here it remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable and distinct, with a consistent lexicon that suits Elara’s ritualistic, quasi-mystic perspective. Rhythmic, image-dense sentences feel intentional rather than mechanically ornate, and the narrative distance stays tight enough to keep us inside her experience. Purposeful repetitions (“furiously tranquil,” entropy decreasing, borrowed time) create a cohesive tonal pattern. There are no POV leaks or stance breaks, and the lyric mode is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s observant, technical yet reverent mindset. Diction like “microclimate variations” and “solstice hush” feels organic to this world and focalizer. A few constructions (“credibly curious”) read as prompt artifacts rather than natural idiom, which momentarily jars the otherwise smooth voice. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and stable under mild pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and clearly aligned with a contemplative, spiritually attuned focalizer; diction like “cathedral of amber shadows” and “geography of surrender” feels coherent with his interior life. POV distance is stable and close enough to carry emotional color without head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. At times the narratorial stance edges into aphoristic essay mode, but it doesn’t fracture the lens or obscure events.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is coherent, with a distinct lyric texture built around bees, light, and ash; phrases like “magnetic loneliness” and “architecture of abandonment” feel of a piece with Elias’s perception. The diction is elevated but generally consistent and plausible for the narrative stance, and there is no head-hopping or POV confusion. Modulation under pressure is subtle—tone stays uniformly hushed and reverent, which suits the piece but flattens contrast. A few abstract formulations slightly distance us from Elias’s body, but overall the voice is controlled and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct metaphoric palette and a confident handling of surreal logic (“three became yesterday and seven transformed into the color blue”). Diction and rhythm feel deliberate and mostly well-controlled, maintaining a unified perceptual signature suited to an altered-temporality premise. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register jumps, though occasional thesis-like statements briefly flatten the otherwise textured narration. Overall, the voice is strong enough to carry an experimental concept without losing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and lyrically confident, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and small natural sounds. Diction is elevated but coherent with a contemplative poet figure, and the rhythm modulates well between longer descriptive sentences and shorter, more decisive lines around the kite incident. Dialogue is sparse but sounds natural for both characters and doesn’t break the established register. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” tendency; the narrative maintains an intimate yet slightly distanced lyric stance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and lyrically descriptive, matching the quasi-sacred, speculative setting. Diction choices like “calcified neural networks” and “biological negotiation” feel specific to this story’s conceptual frame and the caretaker’s long familiarity with the temple. There’s good control of distance: we remain close enough to his perceptions while maintaining a slight mythic remove. Occasional grand abstractions (“mutual understanding,” “biological prejudice”) could be grounded more in his particular thought-texture, but they don’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and intellectually inflected, matching a group of reflective scientists contemplating existential change. Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, with a clear perceptual bias toward metaphor and conceptual framing. There is some mild drift into essayistic omniscience (“They had come not to worship the Visitors…”) that nudges distance outward but doesn’t confuse POV. Dialogue is sparse yet natural in this elevated context and serves theme more than character, which fits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is highly distinctive—literate, metaphorically bold, and consistently filtered through the coachman’s linguistic and ecological obsessions. Diction stays coherent (littoral kingdoms, declensions of calcium, subjunctive mood) and the rhythm of long, sinuous sentences suits the liturgical mood. The POV distance is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or register collapse. At times the density of imagery approaches saturation, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice tied to Ash has a strong perceptual signature, privileging smells, vibrations, and mechanical sounds over human abstractions. Phrases like “his paws knew the rhythm of rust and regret” and “metallic lungs” show controlled, lyric diction that matches the melancholy tone. There are a few slightly authorial or abstract intrusions (“cartography of the heart,” “tinted revelation”) that momentarily pull away from pure canine focalization. Nonetheless, POV remains stable and the rhythm modulates well toward the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s scientific-yet-poetic sensibility. Diction like “chronometric radiation” and “underlying topology of the spacetime fracture” fits both genre and her profession, while metaphors of maps and navigation maintain a coherent perceptual signature. At times the prose approaches purple, but it still feels like the textured thought of someone trapped in stretched time rather than authorial ornamentation. POV remains stable with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending mythic diction with tactile specificity, and Kael’s perceptions (fractals, deranged heavens) give a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the guardian’s archaic formality contrasting nicely with Kael’s steady, plainspoken replies. There’s minimal POV slippage and the narrative distance remains consistent. At times the register slides into essayistic abstraction, but overall the voice feels confident and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, matching Mira’s reflective and symbolic sensibility. Diction like “nomadic penumbra” and “luminous absence” feels deliberate rather than arbitrary, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is steady; we remain anchored in Mira’s perspective without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Occasional abstraction edges toward essayistic, but the line never quite breaks, thanks to steady anchoring in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close-third voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of bodily imagery, architecture, and linguistics (“translate silence into geography,” “hidden thunder trapped in a mason jar”). Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, sustaining a baroque register that feels organic to this consciousness. Psychic distance is steady; we never slip into knowledge Vey couldn’t plausibly hold, and the narrative certainty matches their expanding understanding. The lushness occasionally risks overwhelming individual beats, but it never fully obscures action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, confident, and texturally distinct, with a controlled lyrical register that matches Kaelen’s meticulous, contemplative mind. Phrases like “fierce repose” and “woven hush” recur in a way that feels patterned rather than lazy, and psychic distance is well managed so that interiority and external detail interweave smoothly. There is no head-hopping or unexplained stance shift, and the narrative certainty stays within what this focalizer could plausibly infer. The voice skirts purple at moments but retains clarity and precision, sustaining its cadence through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong sensory and conceptual signature (“forged hush,” “prismatic shards,” “echo system”). Dialogue is sparse but character-appropriate: Kael’s strained caution contrasts with Lira’s bright literalism, and Overseer commands are sharply repurposed by the world’s logic. The narrative lexicon is elevated but feels coherent with the fable-like, mythic frame rather than an imposed register. At times the voice drifts into explanatory abstraction, but it never loses POV coherence or temporal footing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric but not opaque, with memorable phrasing like “the air tasted of copper and impending erasure” and “dire enchantment.” Psychic distance stays stable, anchored in Elara’s perceptions and lexicon, and the narrative modulation from technical (“brass pistons seizing”) to mystical feels intentional. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the slightly elevated register suits an alchemist in a fantastical milieu. A few thematic abstractions (“golden truth of what had actually been”) lightly dilute the otherwise sharp perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to an aging, reflective painter; perception and diction feel plausibly his. Syntax and rhythm show control, modulating between long, sensuous description and tighter, pressure-inflected lines when he realizes he is lost. The narrative distance remains steady and no head-hopping or stance confusion appears. The occasional conceptual phrase feels slightly essayistic, but not enough to fracture the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with distinctive metaphors and rhythms (“a lullaby sung through clenched teeth,” “dome of high pressure that had killed two fishermen”). The diction level and imagery suit a reflective, hyper-attentive focalizer, and psychic distance is well-managed, tightening toward the climax. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty matches what Elias can plausibly infer. The voice’s intensity flirts with uniformity in tone but remains controlled and purposeful, especially as it crests into the weeping-at-the-glass closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, textured, and unmistakably hers—technical terms (hydraulics, meridians, satellites) sit naturally beside mythic and devotional language. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between dense, lyrical reflections and more grounded mechanical actions like soldering and fitting the censer foot. The perceptual signature—war salvage body, lunar cognition, radio ghosts—is distinctive and coherent, with no POV leakage or stance confusion. It falls just shy of 9+ because a few thematic declarations edge toward the abstract rather than trusting the voice’s rich imagery to carry meaning implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature—Maren notices soil chemistry, mycelium, and storm mechanics alongside psychological concepts. Diction balances scientific and quasi-mystical registers in a way that reflects her divided mindset, and the brief quoted line (“I am afraid”) hits harder because the narrative voice has been more composed up to that point. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense remains stable. Occasionally abstract phrasing (“network of shared consciousness”) distances us slightly from her body, but not enough to fracture POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated but stable, with a consistent perceptual signature that fits a reflective, almost mythic frame around Maren’s experience. Diction (“nautical twilight,” “negative space,” “witnessed isolation”) is controlled and pattern-consistent, and psychic distance modulates smoothly from external description to deep interior without confusion. There is a mild tension between the lofty register and a solitary keeper’s plausible lexicon, but the narration feels more like a composed storyteller channeling her experience than strict thought-transcription, so it reads intentional. No POV slips or unearned omniscience undercut the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, slightly antique lexicon that fits a lonely map dealer and his obsessive vocation. Diction like “empirically intuitive” and the sensory bias toward paper, ink, and provenance mark a consistent perceptual signature. Rhythm varies well between long, baroque sentences and crisper turns at key actions (“Arthur knelt, ignoring the water…,” “He pressed the matrix chip into the fissure…”). A touch of narratorial abstraction in a few lines nudges away from pure character-bound voice but doesn’t break cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear preference for lush metaphor and long, cadenced sentences that suit a high-fantasy, mythic register. Third-person focalization stays anchored in Elara’s sensibility even as the diction sometimes approaches an omniscient lyric narrator; the modulation feels intentional rather than leaky. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Mara’s brief lines carrying weight and not breaking tone. The main limitation is that the elevated register is nearly constant, leaving little modulation between high-pressure and quieter beats that could sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and distinctively “scientifically romantic,” blending technical diction with lyricism in a way that feels like Elara’s perceptual signature. Phrases like “compass calibrated to heartbeat rhythms” and “directed spontaneity” show controlled, patterned idiosyncrasy rather than random ornament. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Mira’s few lines are appropriately simple against the heightened narrative register, which underscores the intimacy of the revelation. The only drawback is that the lofty register occasionally brushes up against essayistic commentary, risking a slight distance from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, distinct, and well-matched to a professional dream chronicler experiencing temporal breakdown. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a lyrical but intelligible texture (“feral nostalgia,” “tangled ouroboros,” “jaded wonder”) that feels like his mind rather than generic loftiness. Psychic distance is handled well, zooming in on interiority during key beats and easing out to broader, almost cosmic perspective during the ascent. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Mara’s profession and sensory loss. Syntax and diction are controlled and varied, with recurring phrases (“reading between the lines,” “trembling calm”) forming a deliberate pattern rather than artifact. The narrative distance stays tight to her perceptions without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally, the voice drifts toward essayistic abstraction in thematic lines, but not enough to blur POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically tilted in a way that suits Elara’s scholarly, sensory-rich perception. Diction like “saturated hush,” “bruised purple light,” and “narrative potential” coheres with a rune scholar’s mind and maintains a stable psychic distance. Under peak stress, the prose remains controlled but perhaps too composed; her thought-process doesn’t degrade much despite the oxygen deprivation, which slightly undercuts immediacy. Still, focalization is clean and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive blend of lyric metaphoricity and grounded technical detail (“modified theremin,” “ballasts”). Elara’s perception—thinking in metaphors about voltage, bells, and circuitry—feels integral to her character rather than generic purple prose. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext and thematic weight without sounding expository, and the ghost’s “Like seeds” line arrives via an inventive channel (static through ventilation). A few aphoristic sentences flirt with over-crafted authorial intrusion, but they’re still aligned to her sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and distinctive, with recurring phrases (“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush”) that establish a clear perceptual signature. Syntax and diction mostly feel intentional and controlled, suiting an almost liturgical tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance is stable. The risk is a slight sameness of register and tempo across the whole piece, which flattens modulation under what should be peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in technical timekeeping terms and sensory attention to water, stone, and silence. Syntax and rhythm modulate with the counting and with rising realization, creating a persuasive interior monologue. Diction is elevated but plausibly anchored in this solitary, reflective specialist. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though at moments the loftiness of phrasing edges toward uniformity in tone.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly rooted in Maya’s perceptual biases (architecture of mycelium, spatial mapping, security language). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with the prose tightening slightly around charged beats (the trembling red dot, “Show me”) without losing clarity. Dialogue is a bit thesis-forward but still feels like these specific people, under this specific pressure, articulating their obsessions. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance shifts are intentional and smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a probability professor who thinks in abstractions and metaphors; phrases like “numbers were desperate prayers” and “a curriculum of accident and intention” feel character-specific. Psychic distance is controlled, with a steady, interior-focused lens that never drifts into omniscient explanation of others. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the elevated diction matches her education and temperament rather than reading as authorial intrusion. The voice maintains coherence even under emotional pressure, integrating technical terms (probability, Bayesian inference) without breaking tone.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent third-person distance that feels closely attuned to Mara’s mythic role rather than her literal psyche. Diction (“the booth stood beneath the third rail's corpse,” “afterlife's switchboard”) is precise and tonally unified, sustaining a haunted, speculative register. There are no POV slips or expository intrusions; the narrative certainty matches the quasi-mystical frame it’s built. The only limitation is that the voice sometimes feels more like an authorial intelligence than Mara’s own perception, trading some intimacy for elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is assured, with a distinctive lexicon (salinity, gravity, silver nitrate, tannin) that feels true to Mara’s archivist sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; the prose modulates from coolly observant to more incantatory as the ritual peaks without losing clarity. The narrator does not overstep what Mara could plausibly conceptualize; even the quasi-scientific framing reads as her internal logic. There’s a unified perceptual signature throughout, though an occasional shift into slightly essay-like explanation lightly flattens the otherwise immersive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a distinct blend of wry humor and lyricism (“Lovely weather for a catastrophe”; “a polite anarchy where social hierarchies dissolved”). Diction and rhythm suit both Elias’s background and the quasi-mythic frame, and the few lines of dialogue feel natural while carrying subtext. Occasional essay-like sentences skate close to authorial commentary, but they don’t disrupt focalization enough to feel like POV leakage. Overall, the perceptual signature is memorable and controlled under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature: everything is filtered through sensation and metaphor that suit a blind emotional cartographer. Rhythm varies, and the prose modulates intensity well, particularly around the discovery of the silence and the “quiet blaze” of understanding. There is no POV leakage or explanatory narrator; even high-concept lines feel like her way of thinking. The only minor limitation is that the lyric register is fairly uniform across the piece, leaving little roughness or fracture under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elara’s professional lens (angles of incidence, microwave whispers, parallax gauges). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with extended metaphors (origami time, pretzel logic) forming a consistent, taught pattern rather than random ornament. There’s no head-hopping; even the ghostly colleagues are perceived strictly through her POV. Occasionally the register edges toward generalized abstraction in thematic sentences, but the overall perceptual signature remains distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct, calm rhythm that suits Elias’s age and obsession and remains consistent throughout. POV stays effectively centered on Elias while allowing light, plausible access to Mara’s affect (“Mara wept silently…”), without jarring head-hops. Syntax and diction show purposeful modulation—slower, more expansive when mapping, more charged and clipped as he “plays” the symphony. A few lines edge toward generalized lyricism rather than strictly character-tinted perception, but they don’t break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built around paradoxical pairings (“volcanic tenderness,” “mineral regret”). Diction generally fits a reflective, intense consciousness and maintains a stable psychic distance. At times, the narration slides into abstract explanatory register that feels slightly less in-character and more authorial, especially in the paragraphs that unpack the covenant and her realization. Overall, the voice is memorable and controlled, but the essayistic patches prevent it from feeling fully seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly keyed to Kael’s sensibility, with patterned metaphors around sound, breath, and light that feel deliberate rather than ornamental. Diction is elevated but coherent for the speculative-literary mode, and the narrative distance is stable: we never slip into knowledge Kael couldn’t plausibly hold within the frame. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous descriptive sentences and shorter, impact-bearing lines (e.g., “Tonight, the frequencies aligned.”). There’s minor risk of over-richness, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads as a confident stylistic choice instead of drift.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a technical yet sensory lexicon that fits a long-time maintenance worker: “gait as distinctive as a signature in wet cement,” “each crease a decision point.” POV remains cleanly with Kael; there’s no leakage into others’ interiority. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, particularly in the understated back-and-forth with Voss about proof and challenge. The voice is strong and consistent, if not quite at the level of astonishing rhythmic or tonal daring.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with a distinct cadence and lexicon that suits the meditative, ritual frame. Diction and imagery choices (“liquid glass,” “grammar of shadows and reflections”) feel purposeful and largely coherent with the guardian’s mythic perspective. Psychic distance remains stable; we are close enough to share the guardian’s cosmology without head-hopping or expository intrusion. The one drawback is that the elevated register is uniform, so emotional modulation across the scene is more in imagery than in voice shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable and distinctive, with controlled, patterned diction (“cobalt library,” “amplified quiet,” “forests of second thoughts”) that suits the fable-like premise. Narrative certainty mostly stays within what this slightly elevated, observant lens can plausibly know, especially given Elias’s ability to hear unspoken words. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the voice modulates gently toward greater stillness at the end. At times, the register drifts toward self-conscious grandiosity, but not enough to break coherence or focal distance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “combative tenderness” and “territory existing only between tides.” The narrative distance stays stable inside Elara’s perceptions, bending only briefly to Mako’s past in a way that feels anchored and legible. Elevated diction matches the mythic, post-violence world and Elara’s quasi-priestly role, and Mako’s single spoken line fits his history and temperament. The lyric compression is dense but controlled enough that focalization and emotional stakes remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct texture that fits Elias’s grandiosity and the world’s strangeness. His Shakespearean register in dialogue contrasts effectively with the woman’s sparse, broken speech, giving clear voice distinction. The third-person focus stays stable and the slight omniscient widenings (on the provinces, the population) feel intentional and well-integrated. Rhythm and syntax show conscious modulation, especially in the theatrical lines versus quieter description.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent in its elevated, lyrical register, well-suited to a “cloud-shadow poet” focalizer and this mythic-feeling scene. POV is steady and limited to Elara’s perception without leakage or confusing shifts, and the diction patterns (“lantern-moth hush,” “metamorphic language,” “paraphrase the silence”) create a recognizable signature. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony despite a propensity for long, image-dense sentences. The high, near-uniform register does risk feeling slightly over-sustained in peak beats, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice through Elara has a distinct perceptual signature, consistently privileging greys, textures, and non-visual senses in ways that feel character-specific. The lyric diction is controlled and coherent, with only a light, purposeful slip into Marin’s understanding that still reads as externally inferred rather than full head-hopping. The single spoken line from Marin carries weight and subtext, landing as a genuine release rather than a mere information dump. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose alive without calling undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctive, blending quasi-mystical language with technical and institutional detail in a way that feels organically tied to Elara’s training and world. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence that suits the idea of a “pilgrimage” through sound and light. The narrative never slips into knowledge beyond what this focalization can plausibly infer, and there is no head-hopping. Occasionally the register edges toward abstract exposition, but overall the perceptual signature is strong and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with an elegant control over rhythm and metaphor. Diction (“genuinely artificial,” “curtains of intention,” “architecture of truth”) fits the conceptual ambition and stays stable in register. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Elara’s speech feels distinct from the narration while aligned with her subdued intensity. At times the voice shifts toward discursive exposition of ideas, but the underlying perceptual signature remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries technical and mystical registers (“liquid mercury tracing unpredictable algorithms,” “neural network drawn in obsidian ink and antique paper”). POV control is steady in a close third around Mara, with Elias’s presence conveyed through behavior and dialogue rather than intrusive head-hopping. Dialogue is slightly elevated and expository but fits the quasi-philosophical register of two people dissecting a cultural catastrophe. Rhythmic variation and diction are well handled, giving the piece a distinctive tone without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent, marrying lyrical abstraction with concrete SF-fantasy detail. Diction fits a scholar steeped in forbidden knowledge—terms like “algorithms,” “mathematical tyranny,” and “final confession” feel organic rather than expository. Under emotional pressure (the dance, the revelation), the voice intensifies without losing coherence or slipping into a different register. At times the narration edges toward essayistic statement, but it still reads as her intense, meaning-making consciousness rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and well-matched to Elara’s perceptual habits as a “dusk noticer,” with recurring diction around light, shadow, and softness that feels intentional rather than generic. Psychic distance remains stable, and the narrative doesn’t overreach beyond what Elara could reasonably infer within this fantastical frame. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, sinuous descriptive sentences and tighter, more decisive beats at structural turns (“Elara finally understood the pattern”). There’s no head-hopping or register clash, and the voice feels like a distinct, unified sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to an introspective, ethically fraught aftermath scene. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring images (“mist,” “layers,” “shimmering stillness”) building a coherent texture without major POV slips.

Overall, the perceptual signature—especially in how she notices color, moisture, and small animal details—feels distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm and a consistent perceptual signature (stone, rings, scars, roots, frost). Diction is elevated but coherent with Elias’s introspective, almost mystical mindset; there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. Phrases like “meteor hush of early morning” and “scars that were not endings but alphabets” exemplify a confident stylistic reach that mostly lands. At times the register of abstraction edges close to uniform (many long, metaphor-laden sentences), which slightly reduces modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent bias toward spatial and architectural metaphors; it feels like one mind perceiving. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring patterns (“while forgotten lyrics search for tune,” “hushed thunder”) giving a deliberate incantatory quality. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and tense remains stable. The only drawback is a slight sameness of high-register lyricism across all moments, which flattens modulation under supposed peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and an accumulated-rhythm approach that suits the ritual frame. Syntax and cadence are varied enough to sustain musicality without devolving into monotony, and psychic distance stays appropriately close. The prose occasionally indulges elevated abstractions that feel less character-particular and more authorial (“shadowed rapture of the scene”), but they don’t fracture POV. Overall, the perceptual signature—cosmic, tactile, and intensely focused on light and texture—feels distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature in its ecological and temporal metaphors. Third-person focalization stays stable around Kael while allowing a slight elevated, mythic register that suits the allegorical feel. Syntax and rhythm modulate enough to avoid monotony despite the density of figurative language, and key phrases (“occasionally everywhere,” “glowing dune in bloom”) are repeated in an intentional, incantatory way. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Kael’s philosophical sensibility, with distinctive diction (“probable miracles,” “respiratory algorithm”) and controlled rhythm. The point of view does not leak; even ornate metaphors feel like extensions of how this particular mind apprehends the world. Dialogue is sparse but functional, contrasting Kael’s searching tone with the stranger’s cool utilitarianism. Occasional abstract phrasing edges toward essayistic, but it doesn’t break the voice’s internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual texture in phrases like “spaces between fear and action” and “shadows pooled like ink.” The oracular register of the guides’ speech matches their mythic function and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: attention to texture, color, and bodily sensation fits a bellhop whose world is motion and service in a muted space. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic, fable-like frame (“Great Hush,” “seraphically mundane grace”) and does not slip into modern jargon or explanatory omniscience. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both intimate interior access and broader atmospheric observation without head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the narration edges toward essayistic explanation of theme, but it remains mostly grounded in his sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The elevated, mythic third-person voice is consistent and confident, with strong rhythmic sentences and a clear narrative stance. Phrases like “regally unpretentious” and “the whisper of turning pages in an empty room” feel native to this narrator rather than grafted-on ornament. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: the pretender’s sneer contrasts well with the titan’s understated authority. Occasionally the diction edges toward purple, but it rarely disrupts clarity or control.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending scientific diction with lyric reflection in a way that feels true to Elena. Patterns like the tapping, the “periodically eternal” tide, and the hum of the station give the prose a recognizable rhythm without collapsing into monotony. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and time shifts are clearly cued by memory anchors. A few abstract formulations in the last paragraph slightly flatten the otherwise vivid perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and convincingly tied to Mira’s sensibility as a tactile, sky-focused rebel-academic. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with a controlled use of long, flowing sentences that suit the contemplative pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Mira’s, with plants’ perceptions blending into her thought-texture in a controlled way. Diction and imagery (“tasted like lightning and chlorophyll”) give the prose a distinct perceptual signature that matches the bio-tech, postwar world.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Elias’s sensibility as a careful, scientifically literate caretaker (“somatic marker,” marine biology texts) without feeling like generic authorial prose. Diction and syntax modulate well: more compressed during somatic episodes, more expansive and observational in the arboretum reveries. The narrative never head-hops and maintains a clear psychic distance throughout. A trace of clinical vocabulary sits near the edge of register drift but is justified by his background and becomes part of the story’s conceptual fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and saturated with Mara’s visual-artistic sensibility, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a strong lyrical texture (“sound like tearing silk,” “world stretches like warm taffy”) that suits the mythic-science tone. The narrative maintains a coherent psychic distance, staying close to his perceptions while allowing some elevated, almost omniscient phrasing that still feels thematically aligned. At times the diction drifts into explanatory abstraction (“mapping the contours of probability itself,” “localized temporal fields”), which slightly mutes the immediacy of his embodied experience. Overall, though, the voice has a distinct signature and modulates reasonably well through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with elevated diction that fits an archivist in a grand, technical setting and a good balance of interiority and external detail. Rhythmic control is solid, and recurring phrasing (“echoing library,” “dizzying quiet”) builds a coherent sonic palette. There’s no POV leakage or awkward elision; temporal compression around her decision is believable in this slightly heightened style. Some metaphoric choices and intensifiers feel a touch uniform, but not enough to seriously blunt distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and tightly bound to Maya’s way of noticing (light fracture times, barometric shifts, the different notes of sandbags). Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, with a distinct, poetic texture that feels of a piece with her “senselessly perceptive” nature. There are no POV leaks or stance wobble; the narrative maintains a stable psychic distance.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and clearly aligned with Eleanor’s analytical, metaphor-loving sensibility; diction like “solemn playfulness” and “atmospheric deception” feels plausibly hers. The narrative maintains a stable distance and does not head-hop, and its lyric density fits the rarefied setting. Rhythms and figurative language are mostly well controlled, giving the prose a distinctive texture without becoming opaque. At times the register skews slightly toward authorial essay (e.g., “orbits of regret were not celestial but moral”), which blunts the immediacy just a bit in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically textured yet controlled, with metaphors rooted in sound, time, and material objects that reflect Elara’s obsessions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and steady in its diction and perspective, with a clear perceptual signature keyed to Elara’s sensibility (architectural metaphors, attention to light and pattern). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing for both close emotional access and broader thematic phrasing without jarring shifts. Minimal dialogue still carries subtext and feels natural for these characters and this setting. The lyricism never loses track of who is perceiving or why.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and well-matched to a scientifically trained protagonist—technical terms like “subsonic frequencies below twenty hertz” feel natural rather than grafted on. The narrative diction sustains a slightly elevated, atmospheric register (“ethereal grit of the moment”) without wobbling into outright purple or losing clarity. There’s a distinct sensory and conceptual bias toward signals, frequencies, and alignments that helps the perceptual signature feel specific.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and suits the baroque, architectural focus of the piece; phrases like “spatial mutiny of stone against structure” feel intentional and characteristic rather than random.

Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—the prose tightens somewhat as the walls close—while retaining a distinct, slightly archaic texture. At times the register borders on essayistic abstraction, but not so much that it disrupts POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a thoughtful, hyper-attentive investigator-artist. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent for the intended literary register and don’t break POV plausibility. Rhythm varies and supports the meditative, accumulative pressure of the scene. There are occasional bordering-on-purple constructions, but they do not confuse focalization or undercut emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with rich sensory diction that clearly belongs to someone steeped in maps and weather. POV discipline is strong; we never leave Elara’s perspective except for a brief, plausible glimpse of the meteorologist’s reaction. Rhythms stretch for atmosphere in early paragraphs and tighten around the transmission scene, showing good modulation. Occasional high-register phrases are in keeping with the quasi-gothic, speculative tone rather than feeling like stray exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature: it fuses Elias’s sensibility as a musician with visual/chemical imagery (“pixelated amnesty,” “chemical soul”). Diction and syntax are consistent and confident, and the lyric compression feels intentional rather than generic. The narrative doesn’t break POV or cheat with knowledge outside Elias’s experiential frame, even when reality flexes. Some phrases (“dynamically observant as a predator”) read as more authorial-abstract than character-grounded, slightly thinning the perfect alignment of voice and psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature (equating venture capital with his father’s robbery, reading bills as “cartographer mapping regret”). Diction—though elevated—feels plausible for an ex–startup executive engaged in intense self-analysis. POV distance is steady and clean, with no head-hopping or artificial withhold.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s twin obsessions with dreams and stellar rhythms. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative distance stays stable, allowing for reflective density without losing clarity. A few abstract phrases verge on generalized “wisdom,” but overall the voice feels distinct and confident enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and lyrically charged, with a clear perceptual signature (“warlike serenity,” “moments trapped between heartbeats”). Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, and psychic distance remains stable; we never slip inexplicably into other minds or disembodied omniscience. At times, the narration sounds slightly more like an authorial bard than Elara’s private cognition, but the quasi-mythic register suits the druidic context. Patterned phrases around mirrors, circles, and spirals recur in a controlled way that reinforces rather than confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong preference for metaphorical, time-charged diction that suits the premise. Elara’s perception colors the narration, and Kael’s brief dialogue feels natural enough within the elevated register. The rhythm varies well between denser descriptive lines and shorter, charged utterances like “You came.” The main limitation is that the lyricism feels more stylistically authorial than distinctly Elara-specific at times, slightly flattening character-particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct texture in phrases like “warnings were merely punctuation in a language he refused to speak.” Diction and syntax are consistent and rhythmically controlled, supporting the solemn, mythic mood. While the narrative register is somewhat elevated beyond what Elias might think in raw terms, it reads as a stable, character-inflected narrative stance rather than ungrounded omniscience. No POV slippage or unmotivated exposition undercuts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, mixing technical appraisal language and tour-rat sensory memory in a way that clearly belongs to Marcus. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring sonic metaphors forming a consistent perceptual signature rather than random flourish. The brief dialogue is natural and status-aware—the boy’s desperate directness against Marcus’s more layered interior monologue. POV remains stable and credible in what it can know, with no slips into unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending scholarly precision with lyricism in a way that feels true to a seasoned Assyriologist in a fantastical setting. Diction like “analogical thinking,” “information patterns,” and “substrates” fits his mind without breaking tone. Rhythm is varied and mostly well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching the contemplative mode and shorter beats punctuating key turns. There is no POV leakage or forced exposition; the narration maintains a clear, character-colored lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person omniscient voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive cadence that suits the mythic, contemplative frame. Diction choices (“wintersun serenity,” “conceptual repricing”-style ideas without jargon) feel of a piece with the world and never break register. The narrative distance stays stable, gliding between external description and conceptual inference without head-hopping or confusion. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony while maintaining a unified stylistic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense but consistent, with a strong perceptual signature—Elara processes everything in terms of resonance, geometry, and stored light. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, elevated register that suits the quasi-mystical inspection without breaking POV plausibility. The voice modulates slightly with pressure, tightening around the hesitation and ritual without losing texture. There is no POV leakage or confused stance, and the absence of dialogue feels intentional to preserve the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and coherent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that fits Maya’s analytic yet overwhelmed mind. Diction (“chemical signatures of factories,” “dangerous clarity of unsilenced thoughts”) feels plausibly hers and remains consistent under pressure. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, image-rich sentences in reflective moments and tighter phrasing as key realizations land. There are no POV leaks or clumsy expository intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and stylistically confident, with consistent diction and perspective. The perceptual signature—scientific-tinged mystical language (“propagation delays,” “cyclically reversed”) fused with dreamlike imagery—feels distinctive. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated register suits the conceptual fantasy frame. At elite level, one might ask for slightly more modulation in rhythm to reflect rising pressure, but control is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with rich, synesthetic diction that feels plausibly like Elara’s interior register given her profession and sensitivities. Psychic distance is handled well: we stay inside her perceptions and associative leaps (plants’ terror, coffee prophecies) without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, tightening around the decision and melting sequence. At times the ornateness flirts with over-lushness, but patterns are consistent and legible, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically textured, clearly aligned with Elara’s sensibility and work. Diction choices like “radiant hush,” “waterfall of light cascading down synaptic cliffs,” and “green net” build a distinct perceptual signature without breaking plausibility for this quasi-mystical technician. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance stays stable, with no head-hopping or register jolts. Occasionally, the elevated lyricism risks smoothing over emotional roughness, but it remains controlled rather than florid.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lush, high-register lyricism that suits an ancient caretaker in a liminal grotto. Patterns like “vineyard hush” and the tactile attention to bark, soil, and carved jade create a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shift. At times the elevated diction risks feeling more authorial than character-anchored, but it never breaks plausibility for this mythic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent in its metaphoric register, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s worldview as a “keeper of lights who navigated by listening to the wind’s music.” Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough for interior nuance while allowing occasional, fittingly elevated turns of phrase. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the rhythm modulates nicely between long, image-heavy lines and tighter beats at key actions. A faint tendency to lean on abstract formulations keeps it from feeling utterly singular, but it’s still very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent elevated register that fits the cosmic-philosophical subject matter. The perception is clearly filtered through this singular consciousness, and the syntax supports a meditative, trance-like rhythm. The narrative distance is stable, dipping close enough for interiority while maintaining a mythic, slightly omniscient texture. A touch more modulation in rhythm (occasional shorter, cutting lines) could sharpen moments of realization, but overall POV and voice are confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confidently lyric with a consistent elevated register that suits this metaphysical fable, and focalization stays cleanly with the skimmer’s perception. Diction, rhythm, and syntax feel intentional and patterned rather than generic, with strong phrases like “to move was to disturb the harmonic field, while to remain was to become its conductor.” At times the prose leans dense, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads as stylistic choice rather than confusion. Under pressure at the end, the voice remains controlled and aligned with the character’s weathered, contemplative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive, slightly archaic-lyric register that fits the fable-like, high-concept fantasy frame. Diction such as “lingering luminance,” “accommodating impossibilities,” and “brilliant dimness” creates a clear perceptual signature. At times the narration tilts toward essayistic abstraction, but it still feels anchored in Elias’s worldview as a contemplative, marginalized mage. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from technical detail to mythic register at the end is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with patterned diction (“meteor hush,” “brackish, hungry tide,” “dust made of amethyst”) that feels deliberate rather than generic. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay in Elias’s sensibility even as the narration occasionally leans into his grandmother’s theories. Expository passages about synesthetic harmonics remain in character for a family of librarians and researchers rather than drifting into encyclopedia tone. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register jolts, and the rhythm modulates nicely between hushed description and key revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinctively cosmological without slipping into pseudo-technical jargon. POV is stable and close enough to Elena to feel like her thinking while still accommodating the large-scale conceptual frame. Patterned diction around static, amber, and backwards causality is consistent and purposeful, taught early and paid off at the end. There’s occasional risk of register inflation, but it remains in character for the mode and does not break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, elevated, and lyrical, with a distinct texture that suits the cosmic-mythic subject and the reaper’s long perspective. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (light, crystallization, mapping) used as pattern rather than crutch. We remain cleanly inside his sensibility; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates to a quieter, charged poise at the end. Occasionally the register veers toward abstract-philosophical, but it still feels compatible with an immortal, reflective focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet internally coherent with Elara’s worldview and stakes, maintaining a stable distance and focalization throughout. Diction like “lukewarm,” “brittle devotion,” and “plausible impossibility” repeats as motif rather than crutch, giving the voice a recognizable texture. Rhythm varies well between long, contemplative sentences and tighter, event-focused lines as the drop-count approaches completion. Occasional abstract phrasing edges toward conceptual (“cosmic imbalance”) but is grounded enough in concrete tasks to avoid feeling like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly textured, with a controlled lyricism that suits Elias’s reflective, methodical mind. Diction and imagery (“bats began to stitch the sky,” “bottles gleaming like captured fragments of dusk”) exhibit a clear perceptual signature. At times the register edges toward ornate, but it remains coherent and doesn’t break POV plausibility for this kind of elevated literary narration.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a scholar-alchemist with a latent mystic streak. Diction choices like “calcination,” “theorems,” and “algebra of her existence” sit naturally alongside more numinous phrasing, establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythms modulate well between long, flowing descriptive sentences and tighter climactic beats. Occasionally the register leans into generalized abstraction at the end, but not enough to break control or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, fusing technical language with a lyrical, nocturnal sensibility that fits Elara’s mind. Diction and imagery (“midnight mathematics,” “soundless echo”) create a recognizable perceptual signature.

POV never slips; access and distance are stable and appropriate to the scene’s intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is confident and coherent, balancing surreal description with philosophical reflection in a way that matches Maya’s altered consciousness. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with recurring constructs (“history rewrote itself”) used as intentional pattern rather than filler. The few dialogue lines are sparse but apt, reflecting the stark stakes without breaking register. Under pressure, the voice maintains its texture instead of flattening or over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent lyric-register suitable to Maya’s obsessive, conceptual orientation. There is a clear perceptual signature in the fusion of technical language (magnetic locks, hydroponic sensors) with lush, almost occult nature imagery. That said, repeated phrases (“storm-born silence,” “across the hush of a possibility just born,” “orthogonal approaches”) and frequent abstract formulations give the prose a slightly uniform, rhetorical feel. The distance hovers near essayistic at times, but not so much as to break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends mechanical, musical, and organic imagery. Rhythms are controlled, often sentence-lengthening to match the swelling symphony, then tightening around key beats (“He pulled”). Diction is elevated but feels coherent with the quasi-mythic afterlife frame rather than arbitrarily ornate. No POV slippage or distance confusion undermines the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (concept-metaphor like “foggy lucidity,” “interiorizing exteriors,” “grey light pooled behind her eyes”). Diction and rhythm support the dreamy, liminal state without wobbling into a mismatched register or head-hopping. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay in her consciousness even as the language becomes abstract, and time/stance remain stable. The only slight limitation is that the voice can be so uniformly elevated that it leaves little modulation for sharper emotional spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, elevated texture—rich metaphors, syntactic variety, and a contemplative rhythm that matches Marcus’s painstaking craft and desperation. Perception is clearly filtered through his professional and emotional lens (reading flame colors as an alphabet, thinking in temperature/pressure thresholds), giving the narration a strong signature. POV distance and tense are stable, with no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts. The only minor reservation is that the register is highly literary and occasionally risks sounding a bit more like an external essayist than Marcus himself under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, confident texture that blends technical lexicon with lyric phrasing in a way that matches Elara’s training and worldview (“resonance goggles,” “quantum foam,” “fantasy practicality”). Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or register slips, and the narrative rhythm modulates well between description and conceptual turns. The diction occasionally leans toward elevated, but it feels character-plausible for a specialist and supports the story’s speculative-literary tone. There is no dialogue to test, but the internal voice is coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and lyrically textured, with strong syntactic control and a distinct sensibility (“the moment when clocks run sideways arriving not with a tick but a tidal gasp”). POV is stable and limited to Elias’s perceptual field, and the lone line of dialogue fits naturally without disrupting tone. The diction balances the surreal with concrete maritime detail, supporting both clarity and atmosphere. Occasionally the abstract phrasing inches toward conceptual summary, but it doesn’t break voice or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive, with a precise, lyrical lexicon that matches the baroque surreal premise and maintains a steady psychic distance. POV is stable and controlled, and patterned phrases (“rational enchantment,” “realistically imaginary”) function as intentional motifs rather than scaffolding, with rhythmic variation that supports the slow-build pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and convincingly filtered through a seasoned, scientifically literate navigator. Diction and rhythm maintain a unified texture of “somber marvel,” with technical terms (edge geometry, spatial manifold) sitting naturally alongside more poetic phrasing. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the limited dialogue fits the established tone. At times the narration leans into elevated abstraction, but it remains plausible for Mara and doesn’t break the POV’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, close to Elena’s consciousness, and confidently lyrical without losing clarity. Phrasing like “contact tracer for hearts” and “reeling hush” gives the prose a distinct texture that suits the premise and never drifts into a mismatched register for her. Dialogue is sparse but functional and emotionally apt, especially Thomas’s brief line and Elena’s “It’s safe now.” At times the narration leans into a slightly homogenous elevated diction that could risk flattening spontaneity if expanded, but at this length it remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmically varied, and consistent with a speculative-literary register, blending technical terms (“ionic signatures,” “phase transitions”) with bodily anxiety without jarring shifts. The perceptual signature—someone hyper-aware of pressure, confinement, and invisible systems—is distinct and stable under stress. Lyric flourishes (“crashing hush of absolute pressure”) feel intentional rather than purple, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elara’s obsessive, liminal state—rich metaphors, long cadences, and a focused perceptual signature around bodies, machines, and ice. POV is stable and free of head-hopping; the elevated lexicon feels in-character for the contemplative, almost numinous mood. Rhythm and sentence length modulate reasonably well, tightening around procedural steps (ink freezing, shard catching moonlight) and opening out for reflective turns. A few piled abstractions and extended clauses risk blur, but they don’t fundamentally undercut control.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the mythic premise. POV is stable and close, filtering the world through her sensibility (“attribute of quiet articulation became her weapon”) without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Syntax and diction show control, with long, textured sentences that mostly avoid muddle. At times, the rhetorical density risks blurring individual emotional beats, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads as a deliberate stylistic choice rather than noise.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends scientific precision (“frequencies that bent light around its edges”) and occult wonder. Marcus’s brief line of dialogue snaps cleanly into the established tone without register clash. There is some recurrence of phrasing that reads as motif rather than artifact, and psychic distance is controlled well enough that the lyricism never collapses into vague omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct sensory palette (“bruised silver” sky, “clockwork fruit”) that feels tied to Elara’s sensibility as a musician. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well with emotional intensity, especially as the music builds and the orchard erupts. A few abstracted or slogan-like phrases briefly flatten the otherwise distinctive texture but do not disrupt POV control or emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Marek’s observant, stubborn temperament. Diction choices like “respectfully rebellious” and “smuggling network of automated eyes” feel unified and intentional, and the narrative distance remains consistent. There’s no dialogue to test, but internal commentary and description carry subtext about power, nostalgia, and quiet defiance effectively. The register is slightly more elevated than Marek’s probable spoken idiom, yet it reads as a shaped narrative consciousness rather than an accidental mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by a craftsman who pays attention to texture, mechanism, and sound. Rhythms are well modulated—long, flowing sentences for atmosphere, tightened cadences around key turns—and the diction suits both the quasi-fairytale premise and Elias’s sensibility. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance remains stable and purposeful. A few lines verge on abstraction, but overall the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinctive lexicon that fuses mathematical and poetic registers (“impossible saddle-point,” “astrophysics-lyricism shelves”). POV remains stable in Elena’s perception, and the narrative distance adjusts smoothly between external action and internal memory. The diction suits her intellectual, slightly eccentric character and the high-concept setting. A few lines verge on abstraction, but overall the voice is controlled and specific rather than generic or over-expository.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature—phrases like “colors that tasted of nostalgia and regret” and “luminous absence” feel of a piece. Psychic distance stays stable and close enough to Elara’s sensibility that the high diction reads as her inner idiom rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative, accumulative mode. There is some sameness of cadence in the middle, but not enough to blur POV or undermine the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture and controlled elevated diction that suits the mythic-fantastical register. Metaphors like “mechanisms that breathed rather than turned” and “a sound like wind through a keyhole” feel specific to this world and this character’s vocation. The prose modulates gracefully between dense description and clearer narrative connective tissue, maintaining legibility without flattening the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Elena’s learned, field-oriented sensibility, balancing technical specificity (Virgo, Spica, precession) with mythic phrasing (“votive offerings to a drowned god”). POV control is tight—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience—and the small amount of dialogue at the end lands naturally and distinctively. Rhythm and diction modulate well from descriptive to climactic beats without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s sensibility—formal but not academic, with metaphor choices that suit the slightly gothic, fantastical setting. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying both combative and tender notes and clearly advancing the core conflict rather than filling space. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping; syntax varies enough to keep rhythm while maintaining clarity. A few phrases (“cruelest kindness,” “blade wrapped in velvet”) are familiar, but they fit the voice and don’t significantly flatten it.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)

Phrases like “the silence between heartbeats” and “radiant hush of moonlight on snow” establish a distinct sonic and imagistic texture. The psychic distance stays stable and close to Elian’s sensibility, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the uniform rhapsodic tone risks smoothing over moments that could use sharper, plainer contrast, but overall the voice feels deliberate and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature focused on light, silence, and texture that clearly belongs to someone who lives in this sanctuary. Phrasing like “interlaced hush” and “lucid unrest” feels integrated rather than ornamental, and the modulation from descriptive coolness to more confessional warmth as she works is effective. There is no POV slippage or register break, though the elevated diction is uniformly high, which slightly flattens modulation under peak stress. A few moments of rougher, more fractured syntax at emotional spikes might deepen the sense of voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a calmly lyrical, slightly antiquarian register that suits a meticulous restorer contemplating lost histories. Diction and syntax are consistent and confident, and the focalization through Elara’s professional sensibility (distinguishing “errors of ink and errors of truth”) gives the narration a distinct perceptual signature. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift; the voice modulates toward greater quiet and reverence in the chapel without breaking its established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent in its elevated yet precise diction, matching Julian’s scientific and poetic sensibility. The third-person close POV stays clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and modulates well between technical detail and metaphor. Patterned phrasing around physics and endings reads intentional rather than mechanical, building a distinct perceptual signature. At times the register is so uniformly refined that it slightly mutes moments that might benefit from rougher immediacy, but control never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and tailored to this world—phrases like “tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert,” and “mechanical sorrow” feel of a piece. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or register slips, and the prose modulates gently as tension increases around the activation and duet. There’s no dialogue to test, but the descriptive and conceptual lexicon remains coherent and character-inflected. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)

Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, and diction remains plausibly within a reflective but not omniscient narrative stance anchored in Elara. The narrative doesn’t head-hop or leak knowledge that feels impossible for the lens. Occasionally the register verges on essayistic abstraction, but it stays just within bounds of a sophisticated, observant focalizer.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits an introspective apprentice mapmaker aboard an antique airship. Diction around navigation, atmosphere, and pattern-reading feels natural for the POV and helps distinguish her perceptual signature. The cadence modulates as pressure rises, tightening during the decoding sequence and relaxing into a more expansive rhythm at dawn. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence remains steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)

Syntax and rhythm modulate well between exposition, council scene, and ritual without obvious register slips or head-hopping. Diction choices like “brambled hope” and “nebula of respite” feel cohesive with the world’s tone rather than tacked on. There is a light touch of authorial overview in describing Thomas’s continued “selflessness,” but it doesn’t significantly break POV integrity.

    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrically elevated, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic subject matter. There is a consistent perceptual signature: mathematical/cosmic metaphors braided with intimate, domestic language (“child finally closing its heavy eyes,” “soft blanket beneath which a weary cosmos finally rested”). The register occasionally risks homogeneity—nearly every sentence carries similar solemn grandeur—but it remains coherent and legible. POV modesty holds: the narration’s cosmic knowledge is justified by Elara’s role and the story’s metaphysical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “graceless beauty” and “offhandedly exact placement” that feel tuned to Elara’s eccentric competence. Narrative distance stays stable, balancing atmospheric description with goal-focused action. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and the lyric touches generally support mood rather than fight clarity. Occasionally the diction edges toward ornate, but it remains controlled enough not to break the character-bound feel.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, marrying scientific precision with lyrical, musical imagery in a way that clearly belongs to Elena’s mind. Diction like “molecular weight,” “long-chain polymers,” and “delta logic” feels character-appropriate and consistent, and the narrative distance stays tight without head-hopping. Rhythms modulate well between longer, sinuous sentences for reflection and shorter beats at key realizations (“She had come to atone.”). Occasionally the voice leans toward expository abstraction, but it never quite breaks the coherence of the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct signature: precise, quasi-mathematical diction (“three point seven seconds of silence,” “forty-two centimeters of empty air”) married to lush, surreal imagery. POV is stable and consistent; the narrative never steps outside Elara’s perception, and the patterns of noticing (voids, margins, distances) stay true to her mind. Rhythm and syntax show control, with long, sinuous sentences supporting the lyric mode without collapsing into sludge. The voice modulates slightly toward greater intensity as she nears and crosses the threshold, reinforcing the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly aligned with a character who experiences the world through flavor and memory. Diction and imagery are consistent and confident—“sturdy brittle,” “glacier of guilt,” “map to the coral icebound pavilion”—with controlled rhythm and no POV slippage. Lyric density is high but pattern-taught from the opening and remains legible through the climax, avoiding muddle. The lack of dialogue fits the solitary, interior mode and never feels like a missed opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the solemn, ritualistic action, with controlled long sentences and a clear perceptual center in Elara. Technical POV handling is clean—no head-hopping, stable distance—and the register mostly supports the mythic tone. Some diction choices (“empathetically decisive,” “psychological barriers”) feel more like external analytic language than what would naturally arise through this character’s sensorium, slightly thinning the illusion of a truly character-bound voice. Overall, though, the rhythmic and lexical texture is distinctive and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct: a fusion of scientific lexicon and lyric, quasi-mystical imagery that matches a “helix-minded” engineer in altered consciousness. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with patterned phrases like “chaotically precise” taught and reused; the POV distance remains steady and character-bound. At times, the register drifts into over-intellectualized abstraction that feels more like an essayistic narrator than a stressed body on a canyon rim. Still, the voice is memorable and coherent, if somewhat monotone in its intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and distinct, with a consistent lexicon (“threshold effects,” “prism-minded consciousness,” “latent blaze”) appropriate to an abstract, analytical archivist. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction feels intentional rather than randomly ornate. The speculative register is well-controlled; jargon-like phrases recur as meaningful world concepts instead of loose technobabble. Absence of dialogue keeps demands on voice narrower, but within its lane the POV and narrative stance are confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent sensory and conceptual palette that feels specific to a “symphonically minded” artist in a silent world. Diction like “reading the grain like sheet music” and “empathy in motion” fits the consciousness on the page and avoids register clashes. The narrative distance is steady and there’s no head-hopping, and rhythm modulates appropriately between descriptive stillness and the slight quickening at the climactic bow stroke. A few sentences edge toward overt theme-labeling, but they remain integrated into the character’s worldview rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrically confident, and well-matched to a reflective, exiled strategist; diction like “correlate,” “vectors of force,” and “poetry of constraint” feels character-appropriate. The perceptual signature—attending to fields, geometry, and silence-as-density—is distinct and consistent. There’s minor risk of uniform high-register abstraction flattening modulation, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in metaphors of sound and vibration. Diction remains coherent and slightly elevated throughout, matching Elio’s quasi-mystical scientific mindset. Rhythm and syntax show variation, and psychic distance is well-controlled. It’s a strong, unified narrative voice, though it sometimes flattens into homogenous abstraction that leaves little room for rougher, disruptive textures.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and strongly filtered through Elara’s heightened olfactory perception, giving the prose a distinct sensory signature. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, meditative rhythm that suits the reflective, ritualized action. Occasional elevated abstractions feel a touch essayistic but do not disrupt POV coherence or emotional throughline. The piece sustains its chosen distance and texture without slips into unmotivated exposition or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature attuned to physical phenomena (gravity shifts, water flow, spectral figures). Elevated diction and metaphor suit the speculative premise and are generally well-controlled, supporting the awe and strangeness of the setting. POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Occasional abstract explanatory sentences slightly dilute the otherwise strong sensory-cognitive balance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending technical precision (anemometer readings, blast radius) with lyrical description of fog and geometry in a way that feels particular to a reflective accident investigator. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with good modulation between clinical and poetic registers that matches Maya’s mindset. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains plausible for her knowledge and expertise. Occasionally elevated phrasing brushes up against abstraction, but not enough to blur perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct lexicon built around sound, color, and architecture, and the third-person close POV remains stable throughout. Synesthetic descriptions like “harmonies that tasted of mint and copper” are signature and consistent, giving the piece a memorable perceptual texture. Distance modulates appropriately as stakes heighten, with more compressed, radiant phrasing at the ritual’s peak. There is mild tension between the elevated, essayistic diction and a believable acolyte’s interior voice, but it reads as an intentional, quasi-omniscient lyric overlay rather than a slip.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctively lyrical, with sustained metaphorical texture (“notes falling into the dry air like stones into deep water,” “compass of bone-white wood”). The diction feels coherent with a mythic/fantastical register, and the narrative distance remains stable, slipping into reflection in ways that are clearly anchored to present stimuli. Rhythm is generally well-controlled, with longer, sinuous sentences appropriate to the meditative, ritualistic tone. The only limitation is a slight sense that the elevated language sometimes foregrounds authorial style over Mira’s specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a lucid, slightly elevated diction that matches the surreal, speculative setting. The narrative focalization is stable around Elara’s worldview, occasionally shading into an omniscient framing but without disorienting leaks. Rhythms modulate effectively, with longer, lyric sentences in descriptive passages and tighter beats under emotional pressure (e.g., as the cartographer drowns in transposed empathy). Dialogue is minimal but functional; most of the “voice” work happens in the descriptive syntax and metaphor, which are distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrically inclined, and plausibly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with a consistent diction and emotional register. Dialogue is brief but functional and distinct enough—especially the archivist’s quiet reverence. Sentence rhythm varies reasonably, and psychic distance is controlled; we never slip confusingly out of his lens. The voice is polished but not especially idiosyncratic, sometimes sounding like a generalized “literary fantasy” narrator rather than something unmistakably Elias-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Elara’s sensibility as an “attentive mystic” with a quasi-scientific bent. Diction and rhythm are mostly consistent and confident, with patterned phrases like “shifted hush” and “truthful lies” working as deliberate motifs rather than artifacts. The narration balances sensory detail with conceptual reflection without slipping into explanatory overload. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the perceptual filter feels reliably Elara’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and distinct, with patterned phrases (“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry,” “raveling silence”) that are taught early and reused meaningfully. Diction and imagery feel of a piece with Maya’s mythic, solitary existence and craft; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm is mostly well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that suit the accumulative mode. At times the density verges on ornate, but it remains legible and controlled rather than meandering.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s sensibility, with a consistent elevated-but-not-academic register. Syntax and rhythm show control, with long, flowing sentences suited to a contemplative, accumulative build rather than high-tempo action. Diction choices (“bartered awakenings,” “charged poise” of the arches, etc.) feel like part of a coherent narrative texture rather than grafted-on ornament. It doesn’t quite achieve an unmistakably idiosyncratic signature, but it is clearly above-average in control and distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping and non-linear temporality; phrases like “she heard not sound but distance” feel specific to this consciousness. POV control is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the diction maintains a coherent elevated register. At times the abstract vocabulary clusters (“cyclical spontaneity,” “conceptual repricing” adjacent equivalents) risk distancing the reader from immediate feeling, but they don’t break clarity. The modulation from eerie wonder to grave acceptance is smooth and well voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly anchored in Elara’s perceptions, with a distinctive lexicon of sea, light, and silence that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Psychic distance is handled well: the narration moves smoothly between sensory detail and interior insight without head-hopping or explanatory excess. Patterned phrases (“vocabulary of currents,” “violence of clarity,” “luminescent ache”) build a recognizable texture without tipping into self-parody. A few highly abstract formulations slightly test the edge of what this taciturn, practical skipper would think in-the-moment, but the overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is coherent, confidently lyrical, and consistently filtered through a sensibility that marries physics with mysticism (“stories emerged from the dark side of photons”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“accidentally prophetic,” “shadowed elation”) functioning as intentional refrains rather than accidents. There’s no head-hopping, and the elevated register fits the mythic, cosmic frame. Occasional near-redundancies in phrasing keep it from feeling absolutely razor-honed, but the perceptual signature is distinct and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with a clear perceptual signature centered on color, fabric, gravity, and light. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—longer, sinuous sentences for reflection; cleaner, emphatic ones at turns (“For the first time since the surgery, the height did not terrify her.”). Diction stays consistent with a thoughtful, craft-obsessed artisan in a slightly heightened world, and there’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. The lyric register is elevated but controlled enough that it still reads as a mind under pressure, not as authorial overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a distinct lyric texture that fits Elara’s contemplative, nocturnal work. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (silver light, quantified sorrow, dreams as vapor) creating a coherent perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance maintains a measured, slightly elevated register throughout. The voice occasionally risks abstraction but remains anchored enough in concrete imagery to stay legible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature that marries alchemical vocabulary to emotional stakes (“bound release,” “tethered to possibility rather than oblivion”). POV is stable and controlled despite the “scattered selves” conceit, which the prose handles as a coherent singular consciousness. Rhythmic variation and syntactic control support the accumulating pressure of the ritual. In a top-tier venue, you might look for slightly sharper modulation under peak stress, but the current control is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and slightly elevated, matching Elias’s contemplative temperament and the rarefied setting. Diction such as “enlarged tranquility” and “logic of uncertainty” feels intentional and character-appropriate rather than gratuitously ornate. There’s minimal slippage in distance or unexplained omniscience; the narrative remains firmly centered on Elias’s perceptions and inferences.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like “heuristically gentle” and “creeping normality noticer.” POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Dialogue is sparse but naturalistic and resonant, especially the knitter’s “This is tenuous absolution,” which carries subtext rather than exposition. Occasionally the abstract diction (e.g., “heuristically gentle persistence”) risks feeling slightly essayistic compared to the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a refined, slightly archaic lexicon that suits both Elara’s temperament and the high-concept setting. The narrative rhythm modulates well—longer, sonorous sentences for description and shorter, tighter ones as urgency rises when the Fading accelerates. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the descriptive richness still feels filtered through Elara’s archivist sensibility. A few phrases verge on uniform loftiness, but they remain coherent with the chosen register.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined without losing clarity, and clearly belongs to someone steeped in this underworld (e.g., barnacles “like rusted coins,” silence as “ammunition”). Recurrent phrases (“comforting unease,” “false starts,” “truce of hush”) read as deliberate motifs rather than lazy repetition. Dialogue is sparse but natural and efficient, carrying subtext and advancing stakes. Under peak pressure the voice maintains its texture without slipping into authorial exposition or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, coherent, and distinctly textured—lyric SF with a strong sensory and conceptual palette that clearly belongs to this world and protagonist. POV remains tightly with Elara’s perceptions, even when others speak, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtextual work about old versus new futures, and it mostly sounds natural within this heightened register. Rhythm and diction modulate gently with pressure (e.g., tightening around the election’s crescendo), showing solid control.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with recurring attention to light, stone, and memory that feels like a specific perceptual signature. Syntax and diction are elevated but cohesive, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The main limitation is occasional over-dense abstraction that crowds the line between character voice and authorial commentary, slightly flattening modulation under peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-matched to the mythic-dystopian tone; it maintains a coherent focalization through Aurelia with only light omniscient seepage (“Marcus watched…understanding at last”). Sentences have a controlled, lyrical cadence that avoids mechanical repetition. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Marcus’s brief speech feels distinct enough in register. A bit more modulation in rhythm at moments of danger or discovery could sharpen pressure, but overall distance and stance are well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntax and a clear perceptual bias toward vibration, materials, and atmospheric detail. The register generally suits a meditative speculative piece, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Occasionally the diction edges into a generalized “poetic SF” register that feels more authorial than Elara-specific (“symphonies of truth,” “cathedral of amazement”), slightly flattening her individual sensibility. Still, the voice remains coherent and supports the accumulating, rapt tone of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person, close-in voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated, quasi-technical lyricism that fits a nostalgic android’s consciousness. Diction choices like “controlled burn escape protocol,” “posistronic core,” and “miniaturize the scope of destruction” feel plausibly in-register for this POV. Rhythmic control is strong, with varied sentence lengths and a measured cadence that tightens in the burn sequence. Occasional abstraction nudges distance a bit, but not enough to blur focalization or emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that mostly aligns with Maya’s observant, curatorial sensibility. Phrasing like “sandstorm frozen in time” and “jackhammer symphony” gives the prose a recognizable texture without obscuring clarity. However, occasional prompt-like abstractions (“the attribute of leads through following”) and thesis statements break the otherwise immersive focalization. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and psychic distance is managed consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinct texture of metaphor around music, mathematics, and spiders that feels unified rather than stitched. Diction and rhythm are controlled; long, sinuous sentences fit the meditative, ritualistic mood and shift slightly toward cadence at key beats (“This was calm defiance…”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narration’s elevated register suits Elara’s kind of mind. Occasionally, the register edges toward overt explanation, but it doesn’t significantly break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with syntax and metaphor matching Mara’s heightened, quasi-mystical perception of the environment. Diction stays coherent—elevated but not incongruous—and the narrative never cheats by knowing more than Mara plausibly could in the moment. Rhythm varies well between longer, flowing descriptive sentences and tighter action beats, especially during the exhumation. The piece balances clarity and lushness without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and well-matched to the material, with a distinct preference for paradox and rich metaphor (“liquid mercury,” “texture of velvet shadow,” “tranquil blaze”). POV control is tight; we never slip out of her experiential frame, even as the narration grows cosmically scaled. Rhythm and diction are purposeful, though the register stays uniformly elevated, which slightly dampens modulation across beats. Overall, the voice feels deliberate and memorable, just shy of the extraordinary precision that would push it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is supple, lyrical, and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature in the way it ties physical architecture to linguistic metaphor. Phrases like “agreed upon lies” and “palimpsest written by every tenant simultaneously” feel organic to the piece’s intelligence rather than pasted-on cleverness. Dialogue is spare but distinct—Elias’s lines carry age and calm authority, contrasting with Maya’s searching curiosity. POV distance and tense are steady, with no head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and internally coherent, with a consistent lexicon that suits a magically literate, melancholy skeptic. Rhythm and syntax are well controlled, allowing long, elaborate sentences without losing clarity, and the reflective distance feels appropriate to the contemplative, high-concept scene. At moments, the register drifts slightly toward abstract philosophical commentary, but it still plausibly aligns with Elara’s consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, controlled, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a calligrapher and patient conspirator. Syntax and diction (“calibrated treason,” “key with no apparent lock”) feel intentional and patterned rather than generically elevated. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving smoothly between sensory detail and interior reflection without head-hopping or explanatory hand-holding. The lack of dialogue is appropriate to the solitude and allows the narrative voice to carry texture and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how Mira experiences sound, resonance, and cosmic scale (“a vibration she felt in her teeth rather than heard”). Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical frame, and the narrative distance remains stable. Occasional abstractions and high-register phrases skirt purple but don’t break plausibility for this mythic tone. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, matching the ritual gravity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built around cold, light, and pressure. Diction choices (“borrowed starlight,” “subconscious residue,” “mosaic clearer than any single memory”) feel unified and attuned to a character who lives between material salvage and spiritual interpretation. POV is stable, with no head-hopping and no unmotivated withholding; exposition about her methods is delivered in a voice that matches her obsessive, painstaking nature. There is a mild tendency toward uniformly elevated register, but it suits the quasi-sacral tone of the piece and does not impair clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and distinctive: meditative, precise, and slightly formal in a way that suits an older “net-mender philosopher.” Diction choices like “demure audacity,” “invisible cartographies,” and “scintillatingly somber” establish a stable, character-inflected register that never blatantly contradicts the POV. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous descriptive sentences and shorter, firmer closures at key beats (e.g., her final descent). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence matches the quiet scope.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and colored by Mara’s skeptical, analytical mindset, with some striking phrases (“biological stillpoint,” “storms circled like hungry wolves denied entry”). Institutional and scientific diction is well-motivated by the letters and her background, avoiding register clash. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shifts, and expository passages remain legible. The voice could sharpen further by letting more of Mara’s idiosyncratic perception and emotional texture inflect the explanatory segments.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphors and diction (“variant allegiance,” “locksmith of realities,” “grit in a gear”). POV is stable and controlled; we never leave Elian’s consciousness, and the elevated register fits his quasi-mystic, obsessive temperament. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support a sustained, dreamlike pressure. Lyricism does occasionally risk excess, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than showy for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elias’s sensibility—scholarly yet weathered, with metaphors keyed to sound, salt, and glass. Syntax and rhythm vary with emotional intensity, and the narration balances lyricism with clarity; phrases like “positively wistful joy that stung like honey” feel intentional rather than random ornament. There is no head-hopping or unjustified distance shift, and the slight omniscient tilt never breaks coherence. A few lines skirt the edge of over-crafted, but they remain within a consistent, character-plausible register.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a coherent perceptual filter rooted in an engineer’s precision joined to a lyric sensibility. Diction and rhythm give the prose a distinct texture—rich, image-heavy, and somewhat elevated—without losing track of scene mechanics. Occasionally, phrases like “fleshly ethereal nature” and explicit talk of “harmonic forgiveness” feel more like narratorial abstraction than Mara’s lived perception, nudging against perfect distance control. Nonetheless, the voice remains recognizably singular and modulates appropriately as tension rises.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a mapper and patient strategist. Lexicon and rhythm are elevated but feel justified by the quasi-mystical, science-inflected setting, and there’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. Sentences modulate between long, incantatory lines and tighter directives (“Walk slowly”) in ways that match emotional intensity. The voice could risk a bit more textural variation or roughness under peak stress, but current control is strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct: clinical, image-rich, and filtered through Maya’s investigative training without feeling like generic lyricism. Lexicon and rhythm are largely consistent with a hyper-observant professional haunted by her mentor; moments like “fortified vulnerability manifesting as deliberate breaths” fit her analytic temperament. There is no head-hopping, and tense and stance remain steady. A few abstract formulations could be trimmed for even sharper, more character-grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits a reflective, educated chaplain in a quiet, high-stakes moment. Diction such as “vibrant hush,” “aptly deliberate,” and “charged poise” creates a recognizable texture, and POV boundaries are respected. Occasional authorial-sounding abstractions and repeated stylistic tics slightly dilute the sense of a fully idiosyncratic, character-owned voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct, if somewhat elevated for the repairman.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident and controlled, with a distinctive texture (“a language that tasted like copper,” “reverent absurdity”) that feels native to Kip’s peculiar consciousness and world. Rhythm varies well between long, lush sentences and tighter beats at the climax, and the occasional quoted line (“Another Tuesday”) sharpens character rather than breaking tone. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; the omniscience stays tethered to this single sensibility. The only thing keeping it from the very highest band is that the voice almost never modulates emotionally under pressure—it’s beautifully steady, perhaps a bit too safe.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and occasionally striking (“digital snow,” “ghost frequencies in forgotten music”), with a consistent techno-lyric SF register. At times it defaults to expository abstraction (“experimental storage system,” “consciousness patterns preserved in feedback loops”), which flattens Elara’s particular perception. POV distance stays coherent, though it often feels more like an elegant explanatory narrator than a sharply individuated mind under stress. Rhythm and diction are generally smooth and publishable, if not yet distinctive enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct lexicon that fits this elevated mythic-fantasy register. Diction like “courageous anomaly,” “map empathy onto action,” and “compressed starlight” feels of a piece with the world’s conceptual texture, not random register drift. Psychic distance remains stable; we inhabit Elara’s perceptions while maintaining a slightly stylized narrative sheen. There’s no dialogue to test conversational naturalism, but the narrative rhythm modulates effectively with the pressure of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through this particular consciousness, with a distinctive penchant for metaphoric thinking that suits her detachment and preoccupation with endings. Diction and syntax remain stable and controlled, modulating in rhythm at key beats (the child’s shoe, the last paragraph) without becoming obscure. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; all knowing feels plausibly inferential. The voice’s elevated register feels intentional and character-appropriate rather than generically poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature leaning into wine-making and seasonal imagery. Rhythm and syntax are varied and confident, and the reflective distance remains stable throughout. Occasional high-register theoretical phrases slightly strain plausibility for this character but don’t seriously damage the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the line walker’s specialized perception, with a distinct lexicon (“whisperfield calm,” “kinetic parapet,” “memory-stone”). Rhythm and syntax support the meditative, ritual atmosphere, and the patterned phrasing feels intentional rather than mechanical. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is steady and appropriate to the mythic mode. A few repeated constructions (“through peripheral awareness”) lightly risk self-consciousness but do not materially harm control.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close/limited voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Diction and syntax are controlled and patterned in a way that suits a meditative, slightly fable-like mode. There is no dialogue to test modulation, but narrative distance and register stay stable, and the perceptual signature (attention to curves, pattern, and slow processes) feels specific. It stops short of exceptional only because the voice, while lovely, is familiar in contemporary lyric realism and doesn’t take many formal risks.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and distinct: lush, scientific-poetic diction that plausibly belongs to a mycology-obsessed scholar in a surreal future. Syntax and rhythm modulate well with mood, sustaining a single perceptual signature of someone who sees both biology and language in every surface. There’s occasional register loftiness that edges toward authorial rather than strictly character-bound lyricism, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature (“sculpture of frozen fog,” “magnetic ghosts whispering static”). Diction is elevated but coherent for this quasi-mystical frame, and psychic distance stays stable without head-hopping. Rhythms modulate well between long, lush sentences and sharper beats at moments of pressure (e.g., as the sound arrives and his mind unspools). It doesn’t quite reach the very top because the register occasionally approaches uniform rhapsody, with fewer shifts in texture to mirror his cognitive degradation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent blend of technical precision (“silver nitrate plates,” “optical array”) and metaphysical reach that reads as specific to Elara’s mind. Rhythm and syntax are varied and generally well-tuned to the contemplative, pressurized moment; the prose maintains clarity even while stretching into abstraction. There is no dialogue to test, but interior focus and narrative certainty stay within what this consciousness could plausibly infer in a poetic register. A few phrases tip toward purple, yet they sit within an established pattern rather than feeling like register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries clinical precision (“liver enzymes had flatlined into silence”) to spiritual and sensory imagery. Psychic distance hovers in a close-omniscient space centered on Elena but occasionally widening to include Maya’s understanding, without feeling like sloppy head-hopping. Rhythm varies well, with long, incantatory sentences suited to the ritualistic mode and shorter pulses at key turns (“Then it arrived, the scent of hope—”). The diction matches the elevated, quasi-sacral tone and feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-matched to a young but serious scholar in a strange, numinous setting. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara notices geometry, mechanisms, and temporal rhythm. There are no POV slips or jarring register shifts, and the lyric tone modulates appropriately as the ritual intensifies. The voice could push a bit further into idiosyncratic specificity to feel truly singular at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a controlled, lyrical texture suited to a rationalist confronting the uncanny. Diction like “forgiving skeptic,” “substitute body,” and “orbital” gives Elena a particular perceptual signature that blends clinical and astronomical metaphors.

The elevated language occasionally brushes against thesis-speak but stays within a coherent, character-plausible register.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly matched to a fallen celestial being: elevated diction feels character-appropriate rather than imposed.

There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusion, and reflection is anchored in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (Elara translates everything—servers, icicles, moss—into metaphors of language and memory).

There is no dialogue to test, but narrative distance and access are stable and effective. The voice feels distinct enough to be memorable, even if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to a metafictional, contemplative piece; phrases like “feral nexus in mist” and “geometry of aspiration” feel cohesive rather than random ornament. The perceptual signature—attuned to margins, reflections, and half-seen figures—is distinctive and character-linked. Recurrent diction (“moving against the current,” “lucidly watchful”) reads as intentional motif more than artifact, though it comes close to overuse. No POV slips or register shocks occur, and rhythm is generally well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries technical detail (“axle grease,” “mechanical bands,” “dew point precise to the fraction”) to incantatory, mythic phrasing. The third-person limited POV on Elara never wobbles, and psychic distance is managed well, flowing between close sensory focus and broader communal/thematic scope. Syntax and rhythm vary to suit the build of the ritual, and repeated motifs (hush, alignment, song) feel patterned rather than mechanical. Overall, it has a distinctive and controlled texture that would stand out in a slush pile.

    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and richly textured, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses scientific, alchemical, and poetic diction in a way that feels organic to Elara’s mind. Syntax varies well and matches the slowed-time ritual; long, sinuous sentences underscore patience while sharper cadences mark key beats like the world’s exhale. The narrative stance holds steady without head-hopping or register breaks, and the lyricism is ambitious without drifting into obscurity. At times, the density of elevated metaphor slightly distances us from raw feeling, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that matches Elias’s meticulous, observational mindset and the quasi-mystical setting. Metaphors (time as bleeding, echoes as mist) feel coherent within a unified tonal palette, and focalization remains stable. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how light angles, materials, and mechanisms are noticed. The only restraint keeping this below the 9-band is a mild sameness in rhythm and intensity across the piece, with few modulations in sentence texture to mirror shifting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly tuned to Elara’s perceptions, with a strong, recognizable diction and rhythm. The register is elevated but coherent with the mythic/fantastical frame and doesn’t break POV plausibility given the quasi-omniscient, close-lyric stance. There’s effective modulation between larger, sweeping metaphors and more concrete procedural language (gears grinding, aligning apertures, collecting spheres), which helps prevent total drift into abstraction. Some sentences carry heavy metaphorical weight, but the pattern is taught early and remains controlled rather than arbitrary.

A few highly abstract phrases flirt with over-articulation of theme but don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: mathematically precise silences, seeing infrastructure as circulatory systems, language of flows and intentions. Diction is elevated but credibly belongs to a reflective, technically literate protagonist. The modulation from survey to improvisational engineering to quiet awe feels controlled and intentional. There is occasional slide into abstract, essay-like phrasing, but it does not break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textural, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with a strong rhythmic signature and recurring lexical patterns that feel intentional. The elevated, lyrical diction mostly suits the contemplative mode, and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. At times, the register feels slightly more ornate than a working clock scribe’s inner voice might naturally be, nudging toward authorial rather than strictly character-driven texture. Nonetheless, POV control and rhythm are solid and coherent under emotional pressure.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in photography, chemistry, and meteorology metaphors (“developing photograph,” “rarefied in darkness,” “storm-kissed wonder”). Syntax and diction feel cohesive, and the narrative distance is steady, never slipping into omniscient summary or head-hopping. Rhythmic variation generally matches emotional shifts, and the elevated register suits both character and milieu. Occasionally the voice edges toward over-articulation of theme, but not enough to break control.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with controlled syntax and a consistent elevated register that suits scholarly duelists. POV handling is steady; we’re anchored primarily in Aldric’s experience without head-hopping, and the descriptive texture reflects his analytical, aesthetic mind. Dialogue is slightly formal but fitting for philosophers and carries subtext about competing epistemologies. Rhythm and diction are distinctive without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits Elias’s poet identity and the story’s quasi-mythic tone. Diction and rhythm are generally confident, and dialogue is natural yet slightly elevated, which suits the characters’ roles without feeling artificial. The “luminous fracture” phrasing and recurring contrasts (anarchy vs. beauty, brutality vs. sanctuary) give the narration a recognizable texture. A few thematic sentences read more like authorial thesis than character-colored perception, which modestly lowers the score at this rarefied standard.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical diction (copper coils, magnetic pulses) with lyric phrasing in a way that feels specific to Elena’s mind. The narrative distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between immediate physical detail and conceptual reflection without head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythm and syntax are varied and generally sharpen pressure instead of dulling it. Occasionally, diction (“strategically creative architecture born of sleepless nights”) skews a touch abstract or expository, but not enough to disrupt the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, with a consistent, high-register lexicon that fits a trained “reality checker” in a science-mystic culture. Phrases like “spectrographic analyses of nightmare frequencies” and “mythological resonance” feel like organic extensions of her mindset rather than ornamental jargon. Psychic distance is well-controlled, maintaining close third while allowing occasional conceptual flourishes that still feel character-bound. There is minimal dialogue, but the single spoken line carries thematic weight and sits naturally within the established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on craft, ocean, and color. Rhythm and diction are consciously controlled—repetitions like “rhythmically placid” and “tides of remembrance” feel like purposeful motifs rather than tics. The voice modulates with pressure, growing denser and more incantatory near epiphany while remaining legible. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty stays plausibly within Mara’s experience.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally precise and lyrical, but it is disrupted by a jarring tense error ("Once, she preprocesses") and missing articles ("dust from butterfly wing") that break the established rhythm and authority.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the artistic protagonist. However, the tone occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("vibration that hummed in her chest like a struck bell"), and the integration of prompt phrases creates slight hiccups in the otherwise smooth narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distanced by elevated, abstract diction ("frozen emotional topography," "luminous cathedral"). The use of filter verbs ("she had learned," "she recognized herself") creates a barrier to immediate experience, telling us what she understands rather than showing the understanding dawning.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident and atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical consistency that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. The control of psychic distance is steady, though the self-conscious repetition of the phrase "inadvertently stubborn" briefly breaks the immersion by drawing attention to the construction of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the setting. However, it occasionally drifts into slightly elevated or purple diction ("stored in its metal like potential energy") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the subject matter, maintaining the "foggy" tone throughout. However, the narrative distance is sometimes too close to the author's thematic intentions, creating a "writerly" feel rather than a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but adopts an overly clinical and academic register ("retrocognitively," "asymptotic") that creates a cold psychic distance. This detachment muffles the emotional impact of the climax, making the disintegration feel like a science experiment rather than a human tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a solemn, mythic tone appropriate for the character. The POV remains stable with Elara, though the inference of the scavenger's internal state ("He understood, perhaps") borders on convenient omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and deeply colored by the protagonist's synesthesia and profession. The distance is well-managed, allowing for lyrical abstraction ("darker acoustics") without losing the thread of the immediate action. The voice effectively bridges the gap between the technical actions and the metaphysical results.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    The lyrical voice is generally consistent but suffers from a jarring POV slip ("press your ear") that breaks the third-person frame. The narrative distance is often too great, prioritizing stylized observation over the immediate visceral experience of the theft.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, suiting the "contemplative" protagonist. The theatrical dialogue ("Exit, pursued by spring") is risky but executed with enough conviction to serve the character's stated method, though it occasionally borders on performative artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and captures the anxiety well, though it occasionally slides into melodrama ("transformative betrayal," "manifesto"). The POV is stable, but the narrative distance often collapses into explanatory telling during key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately elevated for the mythic subject matter. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature throughout, though it leans heavily into adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent—formal, detached, and fitting for the robotic POV. However, the tone drifts into high-concept abstraction that creates distance. The refrain "remarkably composed" borders on repetitive tagging rather than a deepening voice signature.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, matching the "resonant" and "crystalline" imagery of the setting. The shift from the internal investigation to the external dialogue is handled smoothly without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a mythic, fable-like tone that suits the material well, establishing a distinct texture that elevates the routine into ceremony.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent tone that balances scientific observation with almost lyrical appreciation of the phenomena. Interiority is well-managed, staying firmly within Kael's perspective without head-hopping. The diction supports the character's role as a mechanic with a philosopher's soul.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but suffers from melodramatic abstraction ("infinite moment," "hush of unstruck chords"). It lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual filter, relying instead on generic literary elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct and authoritative, blending scientific lexicon with a mythic tone. At times, however, the register becomes too elevated ("hollowed and luminous"), prioritizing poetic texture over the immediate urgency of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and appropriately heavy, matching the industrial gothic tone. The perceptual signature—interpreting ghost stories as data—is maintained consistently. There is a slight reliance on filter-like phrases ("Mara interpreted," "Mara knew"), but the overall control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative distance is excessive, relying heavily on filter verbs ("she understands," "she knows," "she hopes") that dilute immediacy. The voice is consistent but monotone, lacking distinct perceptual texture or rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a lofty, overly poetic register that feels more like an authorial overlay than the character’s lived perspective. The repetition of specific phrases ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") breaks the immersive spell, reading as inserted labels rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical, slightly archaic tone, fitting the "historian" persona. However, the authority is undermined by the clumsy integration of prompt phrases ("sensitively perceptive nerves") and a tendency to explain the magic rather than letting the reader infer the rules.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.4)
    The point of view head-hops from Elias to the stranger ("She knew what Elias did not") and relies on omniscient assertions about what "intelligence networks whispered." This leakage undermines the established limited perspective and reduces intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice successfully blends theological and technical registers to suit the "loop pedal priest" persona. However, the voice occasionally breaks immersion by slipping into a lecture mode to label the protagonist's rhetorical maneuvers.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrically elevated, suiting the setting, but suffers from filtering and explaining ("He understood now," "He realized"). This tendency to narrate the character's mental state distances the reader from the immediate experience of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the mythic sci-fi genre. However, the reliance on abstract nouns and baroque phrasing creates an emotional distance, keeping the reader observing the concept rather than inhabiting the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical and reflective tone throughout. However, the density of the prose occasionally creates distance, and the tense shift associated with the prompt word "enthrall" ("watched... as the rhythms enthrall her") disrupts the otherwise stable past tense.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, scientific register ("shearing," "gradients," "cipher") that reinforces the character's expertise without becoming arid. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elara’s immediate sensory and intellectual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, marred by unmotivated tense shifts and awkward phrasing (e.g., "moved aromatically cautious") that breaks immersion. The psychic distance frequently collapses into explanatory summary, telling the reader what to feel rather than inhabiting the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistently lyric and controlled, fitting the "poet" persona well. However, the narrative distance collapses occasionally into helpful explanation of the story's concepts, reducing the reader's interpretive work.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the mythic/poetic mode, though it occasionally veers into purple prose. However, the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("magnificent simplicity," "acoustically perceptive") disrupts the narrative flow and creates a repetitive cadence that detracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, but the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("professionally thorough") disrupts the immersion. The narrative distance is appropriate for Kael's detachment, yet it prevents a deeper engagement with the visceral horror of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is elevated but prone to overwriting and excessive filtering that distances the reader from the immediate moment. The point of view hovers in an abstract summary mode, explaining the character's feelings instead of allowing the reader to experience them directly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like register, but this elevation creates a barrier to intimacy. The shift to "travelers would speak" at the end further distances the POV from the immediate emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the "natural history illustrator" persona. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the surreal world through the specific, analytical lens of a professional cataloger.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and maintains the "conjurer" atmosphere well, though it creates significant psychic distance. The reliance on abstract nouns ("possibility," "resolution") flattens the immediacy of the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a melancholic, reverence-filled tone. POV remains stable with Maya, though there is a tendency to "explain" her understanding of the tapes' significance rather than letting the sensory experience carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching Maren’s academic background. The prose texture supports the "botanist" persona well. However, the voice occasionally slips into awkward phrasing to accommodate required elements ("circuitously sincere clarity"), which momentarily disrupts the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and controlled. However, the repetition of the specific phrase "wryly earnest" for both narration and a dialogue tag breaks the voice's distinctness, making the author's hand visible in placing the phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the high-fantasy genre, though it occasionally drifts into "helpful narrator" mode to explain the metaphysics. The prose maintains a cohesive tone, but the reliance on explaining Elara's internal realizations distances the reader from the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the melancholic tone. However, the dialogue leans toward the stiffly formal ("It heartens me to know he tried"), which distances the characters slightly, though it fits the mythic register of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("analytically artistic," "trembling certainty") which disrupts the flow and feels mechanical. These repetitions act as unwanted anchors, flattening the distinctiveness of the POV during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "unheard symphony" motif, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("melancholy intelligence," "geometry of compassion"). The tone shifts appropriately from detached observation to wonder, though the transition is somewhat abrupt. The prose maintains a coherent texture despite the plot issues.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    The elevated, slightly archaic voice effectively suits the immortal protagonist's perspective. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though the tendency to explain the character's realizations creates a filter between reader and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("cosmic inversion," "deathly vitality"). There is a tendency to filter the experience through cognition verbs ("Maya understood," "Maya recognized") rather than immersing the reader in the sensory moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, matching the stationer's precision. However, it maintains a slight emotional distance, prioritizing the beauty of the description over the raw edge of the character's loss.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, fitting the contemplative "archivist" persona well. It maintains a controlled, melancholic distance that suits the theme of erasure, though it occasionally risks monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a melancholic, lyrical tone suitable for the genre. However, the register is persistently elevated and abstract ("architecture of understanding"), which creates a distance between the reader and the character's immediate physical reality. The prose maintains control but rarely varies its intensity to match the narrative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into "writerly" abstraction ("fragile bridge between what was and what must be") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The POV remains stable, though the interiority sometimes feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, somewhat lyrical register appropriate for the "last witness" tone. The narrative distance is well-managed, zooming in on the tactile work with the chemicals and out to the broader context of Earth and the colony.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The POV is strictly maintained, filtering the world effectively through touch and sound without slipping into visual shortcuts. The voice is consistent, though occasionally leans into slightly elevated descriptors ("synthetic sinew") that border on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is stable and appropriately elevated, but it relies too heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., explicitly labeling the character "dry-witted" and "subtly confident" repeatedly). The tone holds, but the reliance on inserted prompt phrases disrupts the immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic register, but the heavy reliance on repetitive phrasing creates a mechanical rhythm. The refrains of "wild hush" and "infinitely patient" feel like looped artifacts rather than intentional motifs, distracting from the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a serious, slightly elegiac tone appropriate for the setting. The transition into the shared consciousness is handled well without breaking the narrative voice. At times, the prose leans into melodrama ("trapped star," "benediction"), which slightly distances the immediate physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the mythic tone of the piece. The "narrative physics" are explained with a certainty that sells the magical realism. However, the voice is slightly hampered by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases, which occasionally disrupts the natural cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative head-hops between Eira and Julian across paragraph breaks without the section breaks required for multi-POV control in short forms. This slippage prevents deep identification with either focalizer and creates a disorienting, unstable psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The mythic voice is consistent but stiff, often prioritizing elevated diction ("liturgy," "filigree") over immediate connection. The repetition of required phrases like "hauntingly optimistic" disrupts the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the awkward integration of mandatory phrases ("hands moved warmly curious") that breaks grammatical flow and distinctness. These insertions read as artificial prompt-adherence rather than organic description, disrupting the psychic distance and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans on elevated, slightly melodramatic phrasing ("weight of dying traditions," "cathedral to tactile experience") that distances the reader. Narrative control is stable, but the tone sometimes overshadows the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and highly specific to the character’s worldview, using terminology like "celestial thread-counts" to reinforce her perspective. The tone modulates perfectly between the aesthetic beauty of her work and the urgent danger of the coup, maintaining a consistent and engaging perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but frequently slips into awkward exposition to justify magical mechanics ("being the only syntax capable of penetrating"). While the moody, poetic tone suits the protagonist, the heavy-handed explanation of rules breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, using elevated poetic filters ("hallowed silence," "chemical surrender") that distance the reader from the raw reality of the field hospital. The prose often tells the reader how to feel about the scene rather than letting the stark details speak for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lyrical voice fits the dream conceit but occasionally drifts into melodramatic purple prose ("weep with chromatic joy") that distances the reader. The narrative stance is consistent, though the filter is sometimes heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but drifts into purple prose ("sonic womb," "ocean of her own awakened consciousness"). This elevated "art-speak" creates distance and feels performative rather than intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the "rogue scholar" persona. There is a tendency towards expository filtering ("Elias understood," "eyes that... recognized") that creates unnecessary distance in moments that should be immediate. The transition between the heist-like opening and the chaotic climax is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered, often telling the reader what to feel ("beautiful in their brokenness"). The integration of required phrases is jarring, particularly the "via half-sung lullabies" construction, which breaks the narrative rhythm. The shift to the divers' perspective at the end disrupts the established focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the mythic tone. However, it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with genitive metaphors ("jars of extinct tenderness") that can feel slightly formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but maintains a stiff distance through filtering ("Elara understood now"). The tone wavers between literary reflection and high-fantasy exposition, occasionally prioritizing sounding poetic over conveying immediate character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice aims for a high literary register but slips into over-explanation and filter verbs ("felt," "remembering," "understood") that distance the reader. The tone is consistent, but the reliance on abstract summaries of emotion prevents a deeper intimacy with the protagonist’s immediate state.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("impossible warmth," "fragment of forgotten stories"). The narrative distance is generally controlled, keeping focus on Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently elevated and lyrical ("mathematical tenderness"), suiting the dreamlike logic of the piece. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elara’s perception, filtering the surreal world through her specific obsession with geometry and distance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("shadowseam wonder," "softly ingenious") that distance the reader. The repetition of prompt phrases disrupts the narrative flow, making the prose feel constructed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from significant repetitive phrasing that breaks immersion. The atmospheric tone is sustained but lacks the modulation needed to distinguish high-pressure moments from reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and suitably elevated to match the "conductor" persona, but this detachment keeps the emotional stakes at arm's length. The narration tends to explain the magic of the moment rather than allowing the reader to experience it through the character's senses.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a high-lyric mode but is severely disrupted by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("spontaneously anchored," "obsidian grace"). These repetitions break the illusion of a curated consciousness, making the voice sound algorithmic rather than intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and lyrical ("noctilucent reckonings," "mathematical radiance"), creating distance. The register feels more like authorial poetry than the grounded perspective of a salt-scarred glazier, leading to a sense of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is overly elevated ("indifferent and illuminating") and creates distance. Dialogue is highly artificial; characters speak in thematic thesis statements ("The universal language isn't rescue") rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that fits the "lucidly watchful" protagonist, establishing a stable psychic distance. However, the high level of abstraction and lack of tonal modulation create a clinical effect that distances the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and prone to over-explaining the character's internal state. The prose inserts prompt phrases awkwardly ("sensitively perceptive nature detected"), disrupting the immersive texture of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fable-like quality of the narrative. Narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally drifts into filter verbs ("perceptively calm," "he needed them to see") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the clumsy, verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("operatively gentle," "ritual significance," "slow dance of celestial bodies") across narration and dialogue. This creates a mechanical texture that distances the reader and disrupts the emotional flow of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the gothic tone of the piece. It struggles at times with distance, slipping into essayistic explanations of the character's psychology rather than remaining immersed in his immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-literary, baroque style, fitting the "courtesan" persona. However, the density of metaphorical descriptors—"verses," "sonnet," and "calligraphy" all appearing in the opening lines—occasionally feels overwrought and draws attention to the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and sophisticated, fitting the urbane character, but the "First epiphany... Second epiphany" structure exposes the narrative scaffolding. The tone risks becoming overly precious with its metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is elevated and controlled but disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The exact repetition of "interrupted cadence," "transiently rooted," and "blushing stillness" creates a template-like texture that undermines the narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and suited to the mythic tone of the piece. The focus remains tightly on Elara’s perception and technical knowledge. There is a slight over-reliance on explaining the emotional significance of objects ("rope was not just fiber; it was a circuit") rather than letting the action speak, but the tone holds well.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of "ethereal grit" that suits the content. The third-person limited perspective stays close to the protagonist's perception. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing for both sensory immediacy and reflective depth.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is authoritative and atmospheric, perfectly suiting the ancient, scholarly protagonist. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining intimacy with Elior’s internal calculus while effectively depicting the grander scope of the palace geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished but maintains a detached, slightly academic distance ("mathematics of return," "architecture of compassion"). This filter keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Elias's somatic experience of fear or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical, fable-like voice is consistent and suits the magical realism genre. Narrative distance is stable, though the tone occasionally drifts into abstraction and heavy simile use ("thin as breath," "like sugar in rain").

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the technical language of mending with the organic imagery of the orchard. The distinct perceptual signature of the quartz eyes is well-maintained ("casting rainbows across the nave"). The transition from grumpy practicality ("muttering curses") to reflective wisdom is managed smoothly without breaking the established POV distance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elevated tone suited to the cosmic subject matter. However, the density of complex metaphors ("tangled her present in knots") sometimes creates a filter that obscures immediate emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and suitably elevated for the subject matter. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature (botanical/linguistic fusion), though occasional filter verbs ("understanding suddenly") slightly dampen the immediacy of the internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans heavily into "purple" prose and abstraction. The narrative distance feels breathless and slightly invasive, telling the reader what to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from significant psychic distance, relying on filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "aware") to convey information. This expository style keeps the reader observing the archivist from afar rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical acoustic terminology with mythic resonance ("screaming tempest," "legendary bloom"). While atmospheric, the narrative distance sometimes feels slightly detached, summarizing Mara's realizations rather than immersing the reader in her immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and suitably lyrical ("wind that sang," "net gathering smoke"). However, phrasing like "retrocognitively blessed" reads as clinical and clunky against the poetic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and suited to the atmospheric content. The control of psychic distance is steady, zooming in effectively on the technical details of the shadow-work, though the repeated insertion of the prompt phrase "preemptively nostalgic" creates a slight rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. However, the voice is occasionally disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which creates a slight artificiality in the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dialogue lacks naturalism, reading as essayistic exposition ("time has texture") that explains the metaphor rather than advancing character goals.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "writerly" overwriting ("seduced by the inversion's seductive pull" is a near-echo; "gourmet locks"). The tone struggles to naturalize the mandatory phrases, leading to a stiff, manufactured cadence in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a suitable lyrical distance. However, the repeated insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "fluidly logical" three times) creates an artificial texture that disrupts the fictive dream. Perspective stays firmly with Mara, but the emotional register is somewhat monochromatic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("impossible geometries that hurt the eyes"). The distance is controlled, but the lack of deep interiority keeps the reader at arm's length from Elara's emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly purple ("cartography of necessary violence"), creating a distance that muffles emotional impact. Dialogue is indistinguishable from the narration, with characters speaking in the same high-flown metaphors as the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and confident, maintaining a poetic, high-concept register suitable for the subject matter. However, it occasionally slips into explanatory mode, interpreting the symbols for the reader instead of trusting the imagery to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice attempts a mythic, elevated tone but is undermined by the verbatim repetition of distinct phrases ("eloquently silent," "first yawn of evening") within a short space. These echoes break the narrative spell and suggest a lack of control over the POV's perceptual signature, reducing the prose to a collection of descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The elevated, baroque voice is consistent but exhausting due to high density and anachronistic register clashes (mixing alchemy with "frequencies" and "wave functions"). The narrative distance remains intellectual and detached.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by noticeable lexical artifacts, specifically the verbatim repetition of the complex phrase "tactfully hopeful" and the verb "unfurl" (used three times). These repetitions break the immersive quality of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the dystopian tone. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping close to Elias’s perception, though it occasionally slips into slightly elevated, authorial summaries of history.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent tone of reverent dread suitable for the subject matter. The close third-person perspective is stable, focusing entirely on Elias's sensory experience and memories, though the register sometimes drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediacy of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fable-like tone. The POV remains tight on Elias, though there is a tendency to filter observations ("Elias felt," "He understood") which creates slight distance during the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of slightly formal, melancholic precision that suits the protagonist’s background. The POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions and internal logic. However, the voice occasionally slips into overwrought poeticism that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the intellectual/alchemical persona. It effectively bridges the gap between science and magic, though at times it leans into elevated abstraction ("tensile strength of causality") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, maintaining a fable-like distance that suits the content. The POV stays firmly with Elara, though the section summarizing the ghost's confession leans too heavily on telling.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a high-register, quasi-scientific tone throughout. However, the density of jargon and abstract phrasing creates a "pane of glass" effect that keeps the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elevated register appropriate for the fantasy setting. The perspective stays firmly with Elara, filtering the world through her translator's lens. The tone manages the transition from the physical market to the metaphysical painting smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and textured, matching Maya’s professional detachment with precise diction. However, the verbatim repetition of the tag "skillfully observant" (three times) disrupts the immersion and reads as a prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is appropriate for the scale of the events, though the high-flown tone occasionally distances the reader from the visceral reality of the physical labor involved.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the baroque setting. However, it maintains a relentlessly elevated register ("pooled like amber wine," "burnished sorrow," "gilt") that can feel distancing and occasionally slips into "purple" styling.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. While distinct, the register occasionally distances the reader from the immediacy of the physical repair, prioritizing lyrical description over grounded interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent, blending scientific precision with lyrical observation ("verdigris-eaten," "gravity seemed negotiable"). The POV remains firmly anchored in Elara’s perception, enhancing the mood of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stiff, heavily burdened by the mechanical insertion of multi-word prompt phrases. The prose filters the character's experience through elevated abstractions, preventing a distinct, grounded perceptual signature from forming.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric. However, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "dawning hush," "umbral tenderness") twice each feels mechanical and disrupts the natural cadence of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the solemnity of the protagonist's office. While generally controlled, the tone occasionally slips into breathless melodrama ("haunting possession," "terrible context") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is elevated and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. However, it occasionally slips into distant, essayistic exposition ("revealing the naked architecture of cause and effect") rather than staying close to Elara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly archaic tone that suits the "venerable scribe" persona. The transition into the flashback and the surreal imagery of the ending are handled with steady control, avoiding jarring shifts. The voice supports the magical realist atmosphere well, though it occasionally risks becoming too detached from the immediate physical urgency of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. The third-person limited POV is controlled, maintaining close focus on Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is generally elevated but suffers significantly from the awkward integration of required elements. Phrases like "credibly curious vibration" break the semantic logic of the POV, and the tense mismatches caused by the "glue" insertions disrupt the narrative distance and authority.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and meditative, well-suited to the "hush" of the era and the character's isolation. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("cathedral of amber shadows," "thresholds dressed in fire") that feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is appropriately lyrical and elevated, matching the mythic tone. However, authority is undermined by noticeable article drops (e.g., "part of architecture," "threatened eastern ridge") that read as errors rather than stylistic choices. These slips disrupt the otherwise polished immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic for the subject matter. It maintains a confident "close" distance to Elara’s perception, though the high density of metaphor occasionally distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly precious, leaning heavily on adjectives and filters ("she realized," "she looked up to see"). The dialogue fails the naturalism test, reading like written thematic statements rather than spoken language.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, evoking a mythic or fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. However, this elevated tone contributes to the psychic distance, keeping the reader observing from afar rather than inhabiting Elias's final days.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dialogue fails the naturalism test, reading like academic essays ("concept of home was always artificial") rather than human speech under stress. The voices are indistinguishable, creating a "committee voice" effect where every character sounds like the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is confident and distinct, maintaining a consistent, elevated register that suits the mythic tone ("Old Pelagic," "avian liturgy"). The perspective remains stable, filtering the world strictly through the coachman's scholarly lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is generally lush and atmospheric but suffers from significant disruptions caused by the clumsy integration of required phrases. The shift from sensory immersion to awkward abstraction distracts from the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and confident, maintaining a consistent elevated tone that matches the cosmic stakes. The focus on sensory distortion aligns perfectly with the protagonist's unique perception, though the density of the voice occasionally slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily affected, relying on elevated, melodramatic phrasing ("reverence that danced rather than genuflected"). Dialogue feels stilted and performative, functioning as a vehicle for exposition and thematic declaration rather than natural human speech. The tone borders on purple prose, distancing the reader from the immediate reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and mythic, suiting the setting's grandeur. While it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("diagonal movements of mercy"), the control of rhythm and tone remains stable and distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is confident and consistently maintains a high-fantasy, lyrical register that suits the surreal subject matter. The sensory filtering through the "mercury-glass" perspective is handled with strong consistency, grounding the fantastical elements in a specific physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated fable-like tone that suits the setting. However, the reliance on specific prompt phrases as repeated tags ("fierce repose," "woven hush") slightly flattens the distinctiveness of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. However, there are slight lapses into explanatory filtering ("knowing that once...", "understood then that...") which distance the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the "dire enchantment" tone, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("eyes opened, not in flesh but in meaning"). The POV is stable, but the dialogue ("Here... you burned the first journal") feels expository, functioning more to inform the reader than as natural speech within the ritual context.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for an artist protagonist, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature. It occasionally risks becoming overwrought ("frozen lightning," "impossible things"), but the tone generally supports the emotional gravity of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but consistently elevated to a fault, filtering all observation through dense poetic interpretation. While distinct, the "writerly" overlay ("philosophy of shouts") distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the surreal, melancholic tone. The prose rhythm mimics the mechanical/tidal themes effectively ("shrieked with static," "click like a bone"). The perspective remains tightly anchored in the navigator’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and well-tuned to the speculative melancholy of the world. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature (the forager's eye for peat, glass, and roots) that grounds the high-concept elements in tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, fitting the atmospheric constraints perfectly. However, the high register is unrelenting, creating a slight distance that prevents the "violent" emotional trigger from feeling fully immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a steady POV that effectively filters the magical elements through the lens of an antique dealer. The tone matches the lyrical nature of the content without drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, operatic register, fitting the genre but creating a remote psychic distance that observes Elara rather than inhabiting her. The reliance on high-flown rhetoric ("voices trembling like plucked harp strings") occasionally drifts into melodrama, distancing the reader from genuine emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical, matching the "alchemist" persona, though the tone is somewhat uniform. The repetition of the phrase "scientifically romantic" tends to break immersion, reading more as a prompt insertion than a natural descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative and slightly elevated tone suitable for the subject matter. However, the narration occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("clarity of a truth he had been avoiding") rather than letting the moment speak for itself. The perspective is stable, effectively filtering the world through the character's confused chronology.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("emotional terrain," "reading between the lines"). While the tone is cohesive, the prose texture feels generated rather than organic due to these loops.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent but hampered by mechanical tagging; referring to the protagonist repeatedly as "the budding rune scholar" creates unnecessary distance. The tone is appropriate for the genre but suffers from the robotic insertion of prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct and appropriately lyrical, matching Elara's metaphor-heavy worldview. However, the narrative distance feels slightly rigid due to repetitive sentence structures in the physical action beats. This syntactic uniformity dampens the otherwise strong voice during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") which appear repeatedly without variation. This creates a stilted, artificial rhythm that breaks narrative immersion and signals the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the solitary "shepherd" persona. However, the repetitive use of specific phrasing ("eminently peculiar") slightly stiffens the rhythm, making the voice feel occasionally mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dialogue is stiff and declamatory, sounding like written philosophy rather than spoken interaction under stress. The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("quiet wildfire," "geometry of posture"), creating distance rather than intimacy. The POV filter is consistent but cluttered with interpretative labels.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice successfully blends academic precision with lyrical observation, fitting the persona well. The perspective is stable, though the tone occasionally drifts into performative poeticism ("numbers were desperate prayers").

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent with the "melodically haunted" subject matter. The elevated register supports the surreal atmosphere well. Control of distance is maintained, keeping us close to Mara’s perception without unmotivated head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, suiting the archivist persona well. There is a minor reliance on filter verbs ("She felt it," "Mara felt the haunted euphoria") that occasionally creates unnecessary psychic distance during visceral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a fable-like tone that suits the premise. However, the prose occasionally drifts into "committee voice"—smooth but safe—and the dialogue for the child ("You're not alone either, mister") is a generic stock phrase. The POV distance is stable, though it relies heavily on filtering ("Elias realized," "He believed") to convey internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. However, the high register creates psychic distance, prioritizing poetic phrasing over the immediate, gritty reality of the character's emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the setting, but it is disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The verbatim repetition of long descriptors disrupts the rhythm and breaks the immersive spell of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a pervasive sentimentality that distances the reader from the raw reality of the scene. The management of the deaf POV is stylistically confused; the "whispering" advisor is a poetic contradiction that muddles the sensory logic of the scene rather than sharpening the specific experience of the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases, which breaks the immersive spell. The high register occasionally slips into overwrought purple prose ("smoke still clung to meaning like incense") that feels performative rather than authentic to the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely filtered through Kael’s perception. The "auroral" tone permeates the prose without becoming melodramatic, maintaining a coherent melancholic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, filtering the world effectively through Kael's specialized maintenance perspective. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into stagey aphorisms that feel like authorial insertions rather than natural speech between coworkers, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but detached, operating with a "helpful narrator" tone that explains the metaphysics of the scene. The distance precludes intimacy, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("entropy," "revelation," "articulation") creates a sterility that distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and confident, successfully sustaining the story's magical realist atmosphere. However, the high narrative distance and unrelenting elevated register keep the reader observing Elias rather than inhabiting his experience.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but leans into overwrought abstraction that distances the reader. The narrative frequently interprets the character's feelings instead of allowing them to be felt through immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice effectively mirrors Elias's performative nature, blending elevated diction with the mundane. Narrative distance is generally controlled, though it sometimes slips into diagnostic telling regarding the characters' psychological needs.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but prone to purple prose ("teeth ache with beauty") and awkward phrasing to accommodate required elements ("movements aesthetically driven"). The consistency is marred by the repetitive use of specific phrases that draw attention to the writing itself rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The POV is stable, but reliance on filter verbs ("assumed," "felt," "realized") creates unnecessary distance. The narrative voice occasionally slips into abstract explanation rather than immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is atmospheric and consistent, effectively establishing the tone of the setting. However, the shift to omniscient explanation in the final paragraphs ("The system... registers her unauthorized modification") breaks the limited POV and distances the reader from Elara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, and the dialogue is highly unnatural, sounding like a philosophical lecture rather than human speech ("We must study the collapse..."). This "ventriloquism" breaks immersion, as the characters speak the story's themes verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated but suffers from a lack of modulation; the high register persists regardless of the emotional beat. It feels slightly "written" rather than spoken or thought, creating distance between the reader and the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a high, mythic register appropriate for a "historian" of a lost empire. The POV remains stable. The prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("breaking glass wrapped in silk"), but generally supports the fable-like quality of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distanced, utilizing a poetic, slightly archaic register that creates an emotional remove. The distinctness of the voice is undermined by the mechanical repetition of specific prompt phrases, which flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent but frequently distanced by filter verbs ("Elara felt," "wondering," "knew that") and abstract emotional labeling. The tone leans into melodrama ("shattered entirely," "raw and necessary," "stripping off her own skin"), which creates a layer of performative emotion rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately dense for the subject matter, maintaining a steady, dreamlike control. The close third-person perspective manages the transition from waking reality to surreal descent smoothly. There is a slight tendency toward breathlessness in the sentence rhythm, but the stylistic choices largely serve the hallucinatory clarity of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but marred by mechanical repetition of key phrases ("spatially imaginative," "hushed thunder") that sound like prompt-checking rather than natural narration. The prose frequently slips into explanatory mode, distancing the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. However, the high register occasionally drifts into melodrama ("symphony of her salvation") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyrical voice is confident and sustained, matching the dreamlike quality of the quantum setting. The perspective control is stable, though the tone occasionally drifts into "writerly" distance rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the "stray philosopher" persona, effectively blending organic and mechanical imagery. However, the dialogue suffers from register stiffness, sounding nearly identical to the narration's elevated tone. This lack of distinct voice in speech makes the interaction with the stranger feel like a monologue split between two bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone. However, it occasionally lapses into overwrought description ("voice carrying salt and old wood and the memory of every voyage") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it occasionally leans into baroque stylization ("seraphically mundane grace," "preserved specimens of joy"). The POV stays firmly with the bellhop, effectively filtering the world through his recovering senses. The elevated register fits the mythic tone but risks distancing the reader during visceral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic register for the protagonist, but the antagonist's dialogue ("little librarian") slips into generic villain tropes that clash with the elevated tone. The dialogue serves largely as "As You Know" exposition rather than authentic character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific observation with melancholic reflection ("rainbow to bone"). The perspective remains tightly controlled within Elena’s headspace, effectively filtering the world through her specific history and expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice has a consistent lyrical texture but suffers from distancing filters ("she felt," "she understood") that mediate the experience. The tone fits the "stargazer" persona but occasionally drifts into essayistic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated tone that suits the biopunk setting. The integration of the telepathic inputs ("ferns screamed warnings") is handled smoothly within the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently interrupting the scene to explain the existential significance of actions ("not merely botanical but existential") rather than trusting the reader to infer it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently pausing to diagnose the meaning of events ("This was the method," "This was the redesign"). This distance reduces immediacy, placing a filter of interpretation between the reader and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a fable-like narrative, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("shadows bleed"). Narrative distance is controlled, but the reliance on "telling" regarding character states ("cultivating the serene anger") weakens the intimacy of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is elevated and consistent but suffers from the mechanical insertion of required phrases, which disrupts the natural flow. Phrases like "bravely conflicted" and "scandalize the capital" feel pasted in rather than voiced from within the character's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and meditative, fitting the "senselessly perceptive" focalization with a distinct rhythmic consistency. The lyrical tone aligns well with the protagonist's interiority, though it occasionally risks becoming monolithic without distinct shifts in cadence during the physical action of pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a mythic and synesthetic tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the lexicon becomes repetitive, heavily relying on prompt-specific terminology ("transliterate," "sleepwalking") that draws attention to the authorial hand rather than the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, matching Eleanor's "solemn playfulness" with elevated diction. The tone successfully balances scientific precision with lyrical reflection, maintaining a cohesive distance appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic. The filter is tightly controlled through Elara’s perspective, effectively conveying the surreal blending of time and sound.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly "writerly," prioritizing poetic flourishes over clarity or character-specific perception. The register slips occasionally, clashing the magical tone with pseudo-scientific phrasing like "ceramic atoms aligning." The focalization is technically limited to Mara but feels distant due to the heavy filtering through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone, though it relies on telling the reader what Kael "understood" rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is marred by the robotic repetition of prompt phrases ("synesthetically blessed," "fractured timeline") which disrupts the literary tone. Point of view slips briefly into Mara's "despair-addled mind" without a clear transition, creating minor head-hopping issues.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical language with lyrical observation in a way that suits the "artist-scientist" persona. The tone is elevated, though occasionally it verges on breathless.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately observational, fitting the "map maker" persona. However, it leans toward elevated, slightly purple diction ("stained stone and water," "defied instrumentation") that distances the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The lyric voice is generally consistent but marred by clumsy repetition ("truth unravels" appears twice) and a jarring tense shift ("She worked [past] as the truth unravels [present]"). These slips disrupt the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled, but the dialogue is brittle and unnatural, particularly the archaic usage of "vouchsafe." These tonal breaks disrupt the gritty, realistic atmosphere established in the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a meditative tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple stylization ("spindrift serenity," "language he had learned to read with his skin") that feels self-conscious rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is controlled and appropriately lyrical, fitting the solarpunk/fable tone. However, it occasionally slips into breathless poetics ("strange density," "phototropic to kindness") that feel self-conscious. The narrative distance remains stable, though it leans heavily on internal monologue over immediate sensory interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable genre, maintaining a distinct texture. However, the tone remains somewhat distant, summarizing emotional states ("prismatic quiet") rather than inhabiting them through immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)

    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fantasy setting. Narrative distance is controlled. There is a tendency toward slightly purple phrasing ("chewing at the air," "jealous hearts"), but it largely supports the tone without causing confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to melodrama ("geological wound," "dried blood and old sorrow"). The tone maintains a gothic gravity, though it occasionally feels performative rather than intimately grounded in the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately gothic, matching the "rotting wool" aesthetic. The focus remains tight on Elara, though there is a tendency to rely on filter verbs ("Elara knew," "realizing") which distances the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated register but suffers from "purple" tendencies and heavy filtering. The shift to the first-person plural "us" in the final sentence breaks the established POV distance, turning the character's personal moment into a generalized lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("metal lung breathing history"). The prompt-mandated phrases ("perceptively calm," "dusky harmony") struggle to integrate naturally, creating slight hiccups in the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, suiting the "lucid dream" subject matter. However, the tone occasionally strays into purple prose ("constellation of grief," "mathematical precision" of sorrow) which distances the reader from the raw reality of the brother's death.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a mythic tone suitable for the genre, but often slips into "explanation mode" ("This was the method..."). The distance is sometimes too great, filtering the protagonist's experience through summaries of her knowledge rather than immersing the reader in her immediate sensory processing of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the high-fantasy genre, managing the surreal elements with confidence. The POV stays firmly with Elara, though some descriptors feel slightly repetitive or derived directly from the prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the gothic tone well. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("mathematics of a heart," "punctuation in a language") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical roadie jargon with melancholic reflection. The tone is consistent. There is a minor loss of immediacy due to filter verbs ("He felt," "He realized") which distances the reader slightly during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, successfully filtering the world through the lens of a translator (viewing spores as grammar, biology as text). The score is limited by reliance on filter verbs ("Elias understood now," "He perceived") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, fable-like distance that suits the subject matter. The shift from the mechanical heaviness of the librarian to the ethereal nature of the identities is handled well within the narrative flow. The tone remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but consistently overwrought, leaning heavily into poetic elevation ("humming with the geometry of forgotten mathematics"). While distinct, the narrative distance feels pervasive, keeping the reader observing Elara’s profound feelings rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. The "dangerous clarity" of the unmedicated POV is captured well in the rhythm of the sentences. The transition from observation to emotional release is handled with consistent psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent but overly elevated register ("sanctum," "repository," "exuberance") that creates distance. Frequent use of filter verbs ("She understood," "She realized") mediates the experience, explaining the character's mental state instead of allowing the reader to inhabit her perception directly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and authoritative, matching the magical realism of the content. The transition between professional observation and telepathic communion is handled smoothly, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a fable-like elevation that suits the magical realism elements without becoming distant. The "sincerely insincere" tone is woven into the syntax and observations. The perspective is stable and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent high-mythic register, but control slips significantly when integrating required phrases. Constructions like "watched through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight" break the syntactic rhythm and expose the prompt mechanics, damaging the immersive quality of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending technical language with lyrical description. However, the rhythmic flow is hampered by the forced repetition of specific phrases required by the prompt, which occasionally disrupts the natural cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and elevated, suiting the magical realism tone. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the repetition of the specific phrase "meteor hush" creates a slight echo effect that draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is authoritative and lyrically precise, perfectly suiting the "high sci-fi" tone. The integration of technical terminology with metaphysical imagery ("quantum echoes," "prismatic receiver") creates a consistent and immersive texture. The voice remains stable and controlled even as the reality it describes fractures.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and melancholic, fitting the fable mode well. It occasionally drifts into sentimentality ("geometry of love"), but the control of tone remains stable throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently filtering and interpreting Elara's emotions for the reader ("wept not from sadness"). This explanatory distance prevents the reader from inhabiting the visceral experience of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "midnight" tone. However, the repetition of specific phrases ("soundless echo," "radio static") within a short window creates a mechanical rhythm that detracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, utilizing an elevated, abstract register that keeps the reader removed from the visceral horror of the situation. The point of view filters the experience through high-concept analysis ("architecture of her own dissolving consciousness") rather than immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice leans into melodramatic abstraction ("pure conceptual framework," "ozone sang") and maintains a distant, summarizing stance that prevents the reader from inhabiting the protagonist’s experience during critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, melancholic tone appropriate for the subject. However, the prose is often dense and adjectival, creating a "thick" reading experience that occasionally obscures the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately elevated for the magical realism genre. Narrative distance is controlled, staying close to the librarian's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a formal, slightly archaic tone. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose, and the oxymoronic label "stoically sensitive" feels jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately surreal, matching the "fever dream" aesthetic with controlled remove. However, the frequent repetition of key descriptors flattens the distinctness of the perception, making the voice feel slightly looped.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the somber, intellectual tone of the protagonist. However, phrase choices like "balancedly curious" feel slightly clunky and unnatural, disrupting the otherwise smooth register.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suiting the "techno-mystic" tone well. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "watched") and abstract summaries of emotion creates unnecessary psychic distance during high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, matching the "midnight solace" tone. However, the colloquial verb "MacGyvered" jars significantly against the elevated, poetic register ("opal fractures," "frozen tear"), momentarily breaking the established atmospheric spell.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, polished, and appropriately mythic, maintaining a consistent register that supports the story’s tone. The distance is well-managed, allowing for a broad view of the canyon while staying anchored in the storyteller's perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending scientific observation with mythic lyricism. It maintains a distinct perspective, though it occasionally relies on abstract similes that distance the reader from the physical immediacy of the body horror.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into abstract summarization ("irrevocable change") instead of grounding moments in immediate sensory experience. The point of view remains stable on Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from a tendency to over-explain the protagonist's inner state. The tone effectively matches the "twilight" setting, though the filter is occasionally too distant to feel intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, maintaining a unified tone throughout. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("He realized," "He felt") and abstract assertions creates a distance that muffles the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, fitting the "Quantum Verses" concept well. However, the psychic distance remains somewhat observational, describing Elena's "solitude" rather than immersing the reader in the immediate pressure of the fold.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the magical realism genre with a poetic, elevated tone. However, the register is unrelentingly high, lacking the modulation needed to create dynamic contrast between the quiet setup and the climactic capture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone suitable for the fable-like content. However, the psychic distance is significant, keeping the reader observing the ritual rather than inhabiting the embodied experience of the locksmith.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately atmospheric, handling the dense imagery without losing clarity. The tone balances the scientific (folklorist's observation) with the magical effectively, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and lyrically consistent, maintaining a "lucid unrest" that perfectly suits the mythic subject matter. The close third-person perspective manages the balance between external action and internal reflection without head-hopping or breaks in tone.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately contemplative, fitting the "archivist" tone. It occasionally drifts into a slightly distant "storyteller" mode that summarizes emotional states instead of embodying them, but the register remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently elegiac and sophisticated, blending scientific terminology ("hydrodynamics," "bone conduction") with poetic melancholia effectively. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining the "quietly analytic" filter throughout the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its poetic tone but is severely compromised by the forced repetition of required phrases. The rhythm suffers from these insertions, causing the POV to feel more like a prompt response than a distinct, living perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and controlled, suiting the steampunk aesthetic with phrases like “cables singing” and “hydraulic sigh.” However, the psychic distance wavers when the narrator steps in to diagnose Elara's emotions with precise labels instead of allowing them to exist in the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but overly interpretive, frequently explaining the meaning of symbols to the reader rather than letting them resonate. The heavy use of academic/poetic register ("private taxonomy," "curator of absences") creates a distance that reduces emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, mirroring the protagonist's artistic sensibility without slipping. The focus on vibration and texture maintains a distinct perceptual signature that separates the narrator from a generic observer.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but frequently lapses into "telling" interiority ("diligently curious," "exhausting performance") instead of showing state through action. The tone is somewhat flowery, distancing the reader from the immediacy of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is a consistent high-fantasy register but leans heavily into "purple" abstraction ("sun remained a rumor," "soft hush") that distances the reader. The perspective remains stable, though emotional intimacy is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably elevated for a fable, but it is marred by the mechanical insertion of required phrases. The repetition of specific terms disrupts the rhythmic distinctness of the POV, making the voice feel tethered to a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and atmospheric, fitting the grim fantasy setting. However, the control slips significantly with the repetitive use of specific phrases ("graceless beauty," "offhandedly exact"), which breaks the immersion and highlights the artificiality of the prompt constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, filtering the world effectively through a chemist's lexicon (polymers, surface tension). However, the "symphonically minded" attribute feels slightly forced to bridge the gap to the sister, and the voice occasionally slips into authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality of the tale. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Elara’s perception, filtering the world through her trade (seeing "negative portraits" and "bottled moonlight").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is atmospheric and consistent, suited to the dreamlike quality. However, the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("unspoken dream," "sandpaper") within a short space limits the sense of organic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, maintaining a consistent but detached register that prevents emotional intimacy. It frequently summarizes emotional states ("emotional authenticity," "deepest unspoken fears") instead of inhabiting the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, scientific-poetic register but is severely hampered by the robotic repetition of the phrase "chaotically precise" (four times). This repetition draws attention to the writing as a construct, breaking immersion and creating a "template" feel.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the speculative genre, managing the surreal physics with clarity. It occasionally leans into dense adjectival stacking ("feverish intensity," "serpentine tunnels") that slows the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    The mythic, reverent tone is well-sustained and suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the voice occasionally relies on repeating specific prompt phrases rather than varying the description.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)

    The voice is consistent but marred by clunky, clinical phrasing ("olfactorily sensitive nose," "journalized") that distances the reader. The tone often drifts into expository telling, flattening the emotional resonance of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, successfully maintaining a high-literary tone appropriate for the mythic content.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone of the piece. The shift into the "three overlapping voices" is a nice textural touch that supports the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and slightly elevated tone appropriate for a fable. While occasionally bordering on purple ("questions bright as new copper"), the narrative distance is generally controlled. The style supports the "mythic" quality of the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the subject matter, though it occasionally slips into melodrama ("burning confirmation"). The narrative distance is stable, focusing clearly on Elara's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, maintaining a slightly elevated, fable-like tone appropriate for the genre. However, it relies heavily on external observation and summary ("She was a meek blacksmith") rather than deep immersion in Elara's specific perceptual distinctness. The POV is stable, but the distance keeps the emotional stakes somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suited to the "sensory map maker" concept. However, it frequently leans into purple prose ("murmur of half-remembered dreams") and relies on filter verbs that distance the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the protagonist's worldview ("vocabulary of currents"). However, the relentless poeticism sometimes draws attention to the writing itself rather than the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("accidentally prophetic," "otherworldly routine"), which disrupts immersion. The tone is consistently elevated but relies on overwrought description that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, maintaining a high register that suits the setting. The narrative distance is controlled, though the high polish occasionally creates a slight emotional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the subject matter. However, the narrative distance is quite far, keeping the reader observing the ritual rather than experiencing the urgency. The reliance on high-concept description creates a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on a "telepathic" breach of POV to convey the woman's internal state ("feeling her relief... through his empathic senses"). This undermines the isolation that is central to the premise; knowing her exact emotions removes the interpretative gap that a recluse should face. The tone drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("hollow hush," "desperate hope").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified but maintains a distant, fable-like quality that keeps the reader at arm's length. The elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("erosion of its own soul"). The voice struggles to integrate the prompt phrases naturally, leading to stiff phrasing that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that blends scientific terminology ("photonic resonance," "amplitude") with elegiac lyricism. The tone matches the "archivist" persona perfectly, mediating the tragedy through a lens of professional reverence without becoming detached.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of required phrases ("comforting unease," "false starts," "curiously steadfast") appearing 3–5 times each. This creates a drone-like cadence that disrupts immersion and breaks the "noir" tone the prose otherwise attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, matching the "terrestrially cosmic" tone well. However, the dialogue often drifts into the same high register as the narration ("future would be chrome and silence"), reducing character distinctness. The POV is stable, filtering the world effectively through Elara's sensory-focused lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("bands of auroral sorrow," "mathematical poetry") that creates distance. The high register sometimes clashes with the mechanical actions, making the narration feel performative.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fable-like but maintains a distancing effect that mutes emotional immediacy. The perspective stays with Aurelia, but the tone feels more summary-driven than immersed in the moment-to-moment sensory experience of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. However, the distance prevents deep emotional intimacy, keeping the reader in a position of observing the "wonder" rather than feeling it viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone appropriate for the nostalgic android. However, the voice is occasionally disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which creates a stilted rhythm in places.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," over-explaining connections and emotional states instead of allowing them to emerge from action. The voice leans into elevated, slightly purple diction ("jackhammer symphony," "fragile as moth wings") that feels performed rather than organic to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and appropriate for the "code breaker" concept, maintaining a steady, poetic rhythm. The narrative distance remains stable, though it leans heavily into abstract summary over immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone suited to the genre ("subsonic dirge," "mineral lattice"). However, the reliance on abstract filters like "inexplicable certainty" to drive the plot distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and suitably atmospheric for a high-fantasy vignette. The control of psychic distance is steady, keeping close to the summoner’s perception of the magic. However, the register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("fingers of gray and rose," "taste of winter air") that draws attention to the writing rather than the action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a "mysterious familiarity" throughout. However, the reuse of distinctive phrases like "agreed upon lies" and "patiently nimble" within a short space breaks the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans into purple prose ("captured starlight drowning in slow motion"). The narration maintains a close third-person distance but often summarizes the character's internal state with high-level concepts rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the mythic quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic/lyrical tone ("reed-blown melancholy"), but it is noticeably disrupted by the awkward, verbatim insertion of prompt phrases like "progressive disclosure" which clash with the established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, though it occasionally veers into melodrama ("motivation burned brighter"). The tone supports the Gothic mystery vibe well.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the meditative mood. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She believed," "She saw") and abstract nouns ("cartographies," "audacity") creates a psychic distance that muffles emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on "telling" traits ("sharply observant enough to notice") rather than showing them through unique perception. The repetition of the phrase "sharply observant" three times disrupts the flow and feels like a forced insertion of a required element.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and distinct, blending technical precision ("chronometer," "coordinates") with lyrical abstraction ("dream-geometry," "origami swans") in a way that perfectly suits the visionary protagonist. The distance is well-managed, staying close to Elian's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from awkward prompt insertions ("positively wistful joy") that break the tonal spell. The style occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("salt and ghosts," "floorboards thick with... secrets") which feels slightly cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on "telling" ("Mara knew," "Mara understood," "required something beyond mathematics"), creating distance from the immediate experience. The insertion of prompt-specific phrasing results in clunky constructions ("fleshly ethereal nature of the moment") that disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the genre, though it leans toward "purple" descriptors. The narrative distance is controlled, but the reliance on repetitive phrasing for emphasis detracts from the overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for an investigator, maintaining a close third-person perspective. However, it occasionally slips into abstract labeling ("fortified vulnerability," "controlling influence") to satisfy prompt requirements, which distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by the awkward integration of prompt phrases, causing the register to stumble. The repetition of specific unique phrasings ("aptly deliberate," "vibrant hush") breaks the illusion of a curated voice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical curiosity with the required "irreverent awe." The tone matches the surreal "weird fiction" mode, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature throughout the translation process.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but drifts into expository summary at key moments, distancing the reader from the immediate action. The perspective remains close to Elara but offers little distinct stylistic texture beyond standard sci-fi descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and polished, maintaining a lyrical tone that fits the high-fantasy elements. Narrative distance is controlled, though the tendency toward abstraction ("destiny balanced on a syllable") occasionally distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is consistent, ethereal, and appropriately detached, matching the "half-unmoored" protagonist perfectly. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to her specific, altered perception without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice suffers from jarring register breaks, notably the insertion of academic jargon ("intersubjective") into a lyrical reflection. This shattering of the established tone undermines the character's believability as a sentinel rooted in the terroir.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice sustains a solemn, high-fantasy tone appropriate for the genre, but it is compromised by the robotic insertion of prompt-specific phrasing. These repetitions flatten the narrative distance and disrupt the otherwise consistent stylistic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains an excessive psychic distance, summarizing emotional shifts rather than inhabiting them. This detachment suits the fable tone but prevents the reader from feeling the weight of the collective grief.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, poised tone that suits the scholarly protagonist. However, reliance on filter verbs and internal exposition ("Elara believed," "She understood") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly attuned to the "junkyard prophet" persona. The tone manages to be elevated and mythic without losing the gritty specificity of the setting. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elias’s disintegrating experience.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, managing the shift from technical observation to metaphysical speculation well. The distinct "perceptual signature" of a lens calibrator filters the world effectively, though the repetition of the prompt phrase "sage camera repairer" feels slightly forced within the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is confident and lyrical but leans heavily into "purple" descriptions ("flatlined into silence," "sunlight turned brutal," "psalm to the ordinary"). While consistent, the elevated register sometimes distances the reader from the gritty reality of death, smoothing over the jagged edges of the experience with poetic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. However, the required attribute phrase "quietly deliberate" is inserted somewhat awkwardly in its first appearance, creating a slight grammatical friction that momentarily draws attention to the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, successfully blending clinical detachment with wonder. It slips occasionally into "helpful narrator" mode, over-explaining the symbolic weight of actions immediately after they occur, which distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and suits the subject matter, maintaining a steady, devotional tone. However, the psychic distance sometimes feels too remote, summarizing realization ("Mira understood now") rather than letting the reader experience the epiphany through the sensory details alone.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and meditative, suited to the atmospheric content. However, the repetition of specific prompt phrases (e.g., "honeyed hush" appears three times) creates a mechanical rhythm that occasionally disrupts the natural flow of the character’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyrical tone suitable for the genre. However, the mechanical repetition of specific phrases (likely mandatory elements) occasionally disrupts the narrative distance and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fable-like tone, though it creates a slight distance from the protagonist. The shift to the villagers' perspectives at the end dissolves the POV focus without a strong setup.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and unified, matching the "alchemical" subject matter with an elevated register. The specific lexicon ("halide crystals," "syntax," "mandala") creates a strong textural identity that remains stable throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    The integration of prompt terms is mechanical, particularly the repetitive use of "peripherally" (four times) and "reverse-engineer." The voice struggles to maintain a lyrical tone while accommodating these insertions, leading to awkward phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic distance that suits the "weird fiction" tone, managing the transition between mechanical and magical elements smoothly. The POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perception of the weave.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent poetic register suitable for the subject matter. However, it occasionally slips into "writerly" intrusion, prioritizing metaphor density over character immediacy ("fractured the afternoon into static moments").

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like mode well. The shift in perspective at the end effectively mirrors the protagonist's temporal dislocation, merging form and content.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from significant psychic distancing, relying on filter verbs ("she perceived," "she felt") to summarize emotion. The narrative prioritizes poetic observation over immediate sensory immersion in the physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but suffocated by adjectival density and a reliance on abstract pairings ("petrichor nostalgia"). The narrative distance remains static, observing the character's emotions with a detached, writerly floweryness that dampens immediate engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated but leans into a dense, somewhat artificial register ("chronological certainty," "tactile intuition"). It feels like a "writerly" construct explaining the character's experience rather than a distinct, lived-in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is controlled, maintaining a mythic, fable-like register that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though it occasionally dips into slightly purple description ("finger pointing toward forgotten depths"). The focus remains tight on Elias, maintaining a consistent limited third-person perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is cohesive and elevated, fitting the romantic melancholy of the piece. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory telling to ensure the reader grasps the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a poetic tone but is shattered by the robotic repetition of specific phrases (e.g., "bedraggled prince," "quaking reverie"), which read as forced insertions. This repetition breaks the narrative trance and signals a lack of distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, creating an artificial distance through relentless poeticism ("broken geography," "silver silence"). The stylized register often prioritizes sound over clarity, making the firefighter's gritty reality feel abstract and performative.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated but suffers from a "purple" quality that prioritizes poetic-sounding phrases over clarity and character distinctness. The insertion of prompt phrases like "realistically imaginative precision" disrupts the rhythm and feels mechanically patched in.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and authoritative, fitting the "otherworldly" protagonist. The tone is sustained well, though the high register and relentless poeticism risk becoming monotonous. The perspective remains close to Elara, filtering the world effectively through her sentimentalist lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "workshop poeticism," prioritizing pretty sounds over narrative precision. There is a tendency toward melodrama in the descriptions ("thundering calm," "perfect calm") that draws attention to the author rather than the character. The narrative distance prevents intimacy with Elias’s actual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, somewhat elevated register that mirrors Elias’s precise nature. The POV remains tightly anchored in his perception. There are moments of slight overwriting ("impossible moment of stillness," "prayer answered in brass"), but the tone generally supports the gravity of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice relies on stock epithets ("the blithe cemetery gardener") and physiological clichés ("heart quicken") that distance the reader from genuine interiority. The tone struggles to balance the required "blithe" keyword with the somber context, resulting in an inconsistent mood that feels constructed around the prompt list.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately elevated, fitting the "obsidian order" aesthetic. However, the psychic distance is significant, creating a detached, essayistic tone that prioritizes explaining the philosophy over immersing the reader in the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout. However, the reliance on elevated, poetic phrasing occasionally flattens the emotional distinctness of the character, blending narration and interiority into a single register.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is atmospherically consistent, achieving the intended "somber marvel" tone. However, the robotic repetition of prompt phrases (e.g., "incomplete information," "weaved truth") disrupts the immersive quality of the perspective, making the narrator sound occasionally algorithmic. (Capped by Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and appropriately dense, mirroring Elias’s own intellectual rigor without slipping into dryness. The close third-person POV effectively filters the world through his specific, analytical bias, though the explicit tagging of traits ("rationally rebellious") is occasionally direct.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but tends toward purple prose ("impossible consonance," "frequencies of resentment") that distances the reader. The academic register of "denote" clashes with the lyrical, fable-like tone, creating a jarring stylistic dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice struggles to reconcile the lyrical, mystical tone with the clinical jargon of the prompt elements ("synaptic plasticity," "prefrontal cortex"). The result is a register clash that distances the reader during emotional peaks. The perspective is consistent, but the reliance on labeling traits ("informally wise") weakens the character's distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, but the dialogue creates a "poetry-prose" effect where characters speak in thesis statements rather than natural rhythms. The convergence of Elias's speech with the narrative's thematic goals undermines the realism of the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but relies too heavily on filter verbs ("She had come to understand," "She saw") and explanatory interiority. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("crystallized absence of sound") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately poetic for the subject matter. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining a tight focus on Corvin's perception of the shift from silence to song.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, elevated, and consistent, matching the surreal, mythic quality of the setting. It successfully balances the mathematical concepts with lyrical descriptions of sorrow and time. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elara’s experience.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately atmospheric for the magical realist tone. The prose maintains a distinct texture, though it occasionally leans into ornate description that distances the reader from the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "cultured museum guide" persona, but occasionally veers into overwrought territory ("rosewater dread of beauty succumbing to entropy"). The POV remains stable, filtering the world through Elara's curatorial eye. The dialogue is functional but slightly stilted, serving more as thematic declaration than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is stable, but the voice is compromised by the mechanical insertion of required phrases ("neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration"). These forced repetitions break the narrative spell and make the voice feel artificial at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly gothic tone that suits the subject matter ("wet silk," "phosphorescent mold"). The shift between the narrator's interiority and the advisor's eerie instructions is handled smoothly without breaking the established mood.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.0)
    A distinct, elevated maritime voice is established but significantly marred by the jarring insertion of technical prompt phrases ("fractal generating") that clash with the mythic register. The narrative distance remains stable, but the lexical texture suffers from these forced inclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident and matches the mythic tone of the setting. However, the reliance on abstract assertions during the climax ("fissure of pure geometry," "mechanism behind the world") slightly weakens the perceptual immediacy of the POV, trading sensory grounding for conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from filtering ("she realized," "she understood") that lowers immediacy. The perspective is firmly anchored, but the tone drifts into academic explanation, particularly when summarizing the mayor's motives.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a melancholic, elevated register. However, it occasionally creates distance through over-articulated interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is functional but stiff, marred by the clumsy insertion of required phrases like "tranquilly perceptive awareness." The POV distance keeps the reader emotionally removed, and the "logical" voice often slips into expository telling.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is elevated and lyrical, matching the high-fantasy tone well without slipping. The perspective remains close to Mira, effectively conveying her disorientation and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction. Control of the third-person limited POV is stable, but the filter of the "drone pilot" persona feels thinly applied, appearing mostly in backstory references rather than coloring present-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and melancholic, fitting the noir-adjacent tone of a black market genealogist. However, the tone occasionally dips into purple prose ("sky bruised," "sieved hush") that feels slightly manufactured and self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the mythic, almost fable-like quality of the scene. The distance is well-calibrated, allowing for atmospheric observation while staying anchored in the negotiator's tactical mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is stable and controls the third-person limited perspective well. However, the tendency to explain the protagonist's psychology ("sought to align heart and action") rather than demonstrating it through choice creates a slight didactic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice leans into purple noir tropes (&quot;delicate instruments of death,&quot; &quot;living stone&quot;) without earning the gravity. The tone is consistent but marred by the mechanical repetition of forced phrases, disrupting the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, though it occasionally dips into melodrama. The integration of required phrases like "fortune from cookie" lacks grammatical smoothness (missing an article), which disrupts the otherwise elevated tone. The POV remains stable and focused on Elara's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, matching the cartomancer's precision and the ethereal setting. The narrative distance modulates effectively, moving closer during the visceral memories of birth and pulling back to observe the grandeur of the glade.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The elevated, mythic voice is consistent and well-suited to the solemn content, maintaining a stable POV. However, the narration occasionally over-explains the significance of symbols rather than trusting the reader to interpret the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distanced by filter verbs ("Elias realized," "he understood") and abstract intellectualizing. The elevated tone matches the mythic intent but often sacrifices immediate sensory intimacy for philosophical distance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "conspiracy" tone. However, the narration tends toward purple prose ("bruised purples," "velvet" silence) that occasionally prioritizes aesthetic description over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mythic, slightly distant narrative voice fits the fable-like quality of the tale perfectly, maintaining consistency even as the character transitions from physical existence to metaphysical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the poet protagonist, but lacks dynamic range. The high register creates a distancing effect, filtering even visceral moments through heavy "writerly" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the steampunk-academic genre, though it leans heavily into stylized exposition. Dialogue often sounds like written manifesto rather than natural speech ("I intend to turn questions into destinations").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the focalizer's transient existence. However, the prose occasionally leans into overwrought phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent melancholic and ethereal tone that suits the story's Solarpunk aesthetic. However, the repetition of specific noun phrases flattens the distinctiveness of the POV, making the narration feel slightly algorithmic rather than organically observing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice successfully integrates the "empirically whimsical" prompt into a consistent register, blending clinical observation with mythic reverence. The POV remains stable, filtering the world through Elara's specific professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but monotone, trapped in a "poetic" register that prioritizes sounding literary over narrative immediacy. The forced repetition of the specific phrase "rhythmically placid" (three times) breaks the narrative spell, reading clearly as an external constraint rather than an organic observation by the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is cellist-specific: “the hush of unstruck chords” translates visual decay into auditory potential. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses under lantern alignment, then stretches with sustained vowels during bow draw.

No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught by line three and paid off in the closing verse.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Mara’s acoustical perception; perceptual signature is distinct—"ghosts of frequencies," "iron prisons of memory." Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath, mirroring bow work. No head-hopping or register drift; patterned elision ("the world had swallowed its own tongue") is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person remains tightly anchored to Kael’s reed-sculptor perception: geometries of drowning, sap-sticky fingers, starlight fractured through glass. Syntax elongates for yearning, then snaps short at “the graft take root.” No head-hopping; even the mute girl’s gesture is registered through Kael’s skin. A few lyric abstractions (“pain of years spent alone”) flirt with therapy-speak but are saved by the final concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited sustains consistent perceptual filter—an illustrator who notices iridescence, vellum, skeletal imagery—syntax is rhythmic, painterly, controlled under pressure. Neologisms (“time-fish,” “chronos-moths”) feel native to the world rather than ornament. No dialogue, so no register clash; prose itself performs as voice. One POV certainty overreach: “the universe demanded payment in symmetry” drifts into metaphysical omniscience, not character-bound inference.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—mineral gleam, taxidermist lexicon, geometric longing. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for orchard cathedral, staccato for drop impact. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect clean: “he had mapped the coordinates…” carries his diction.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptions, lexicon (“cataloging erosion”), and wry earnest modulation. Syntax mirrors her exhaustion—long sinuous sentences interrupted by terse observations. No head-hopping; Maren’s interior remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains a lyric, resonant register whose syntax mirrors harmonic cadence: clause-phrasing mimics overtones.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is sharp—“salt wind cut through the open dome,” “vibration she could feel in her teeth”—astronomer’s precision married to sensory openness. Syntax modulates: clipped clauses during discovery, longer rolling cadences when designing alcoves, mirroring her surrender to flow. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she understood”). Dialogue is minimal but natural, indirection carried in gesture and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice sustains cosmic scale without collapsing into purple: controlled hypotaxis, tactile verbs (“calcified,” “clawing”), rhythmic echo of spirals and folds. Lexicon (“escondite,” “topological”) sits inside immortal POV; no filter-verb clutter. Compression (“Space convulsed...like breaking glass”) matches peak beat. No dialogue to test, yet internal idiom remains singular and coherent across pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Maya’s mathematical perceptual signature—numbers, trajectories, equilibrium—without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric, slightly elevated diction stays within an intellectual loner’s lexicon. Perceptual signature—“light that served as an ephemeral compass”—filters astronomy through poetic synesthesia.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s perceptual filter: “felt the thrum,” “her gut read the emotional currents,” syntax flexing under pressure (“rhythm felt frantic, a heartbeat before the scalpel”). No head-hopping; corporate diction (“underutilized verticality”) is explicitly their flyer, not narrator. Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence survives.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV remains tightly anchored to Elena’s perceptual signature—spectrograph readings, glove tactility, hypothermic fog. Syntax compresses under cold stress: “breath fogged… refused to retreat.” No head-hopping; diction stays within her scientific lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—light-eating fork, note of each footfall—creating a rhythmic prose that mimics tuning. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the walking cadence; no filter-verb stack dilutes immediacy. The voice never slips into editorial gloss; even abstract notions like “shared balance” are arrived at through physical vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Elara’s sensory funnel; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath-threat, creating a perceptual signature.

Patterned repetition of “broken precedents” reads intentional, not template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual filters—“pale, sweet fruit that no one harvested” reads as her judgment, not exposition. Rhythmic control mirrors act: long, root-like sentences for excavation, then crisp clause at sundial completion. Filter verbs appear sparingly and only when voice-motivated (“she felt her heart shift”). No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her plausible lexicon. Minor slip: one “architecture of bone and branch” leans toward oratory cadence, trimming 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptual bias: “archaeologist brushing dust” idiom, selective attention to fiber density.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—synesthetic slide from “copper light” to “neural pathways,” the synecdoche of “mouths” for war.

No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts as she leans closer to the cast. Voice sustains lyrical compression without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature filters every phrase through chromatic synesthesia—“taste of silver and rain,” “chromatic joy,” “shouting symphonies of color.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional breath; fog sentences drift, light-paint sentences spark. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free-indirect texture stays tight to Mara’s lexicon; no register drift. Patterned elision (“hours or perhaps mere breaths”) is taught early and paid off at fold-out closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual curve—wind “created not noise but architecture.” Syntax waxes lyrical yet remains under control: long clauses mimic echo decay, then compress at the coin-leaving beat.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers close to Elias, filtering perception through rogue-scholar diction—“casual flair,” “cryptic candor”—without head-hop. Rhythm accelerates in warp paragraph, mirroring chaotic refraction. Dialogue indirection sustains micro-setting stakes; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Elara’s perceptual filter: “ocean dream in currents older than language,” “calcium carbonate of loss.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath-pattern of lullabies; fragments feel like half-sung phrasing rather than error.

Compressed syntax under pressure (“She mustered her composure”) keeps momentum without dropping poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-close psychic distance stable; diction (“surgical precision,” “acoustic shadow”) stays inside Vane’s corporate-poetic lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with clipped clauses during dig, then lengthens into elegiac cadence at exit. No dialogue, so voice carries all pressure.

No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat; prose is character-specific and propulsive under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is controlled lyric with patterned compression: “meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphanies” teach the reader early to accept abstraction paid off in closure. Perceptual signature is calligrapher-precise—Marcus notices angles, ink-dark ribs, notches—then dissolves into grime-blind receptivity, syntax loosening as control erodes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice sustains mythic lyric register without wobble: syntax lengthens and compresses in step with Maya’s awe. Perceptual signature is consistent—rotating horses, narrative threads as spider-silk.

Psychic distance tightens naturally as stakes rise, then widens at closure to frame city-wide dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at Elias’s shoulder, filtering every perception through his somatic vocabulary of cinders, scars, and hollows.

Rhythm escalates from long liquid sentences to the clipped “I give you my silence,” mirroring surrender. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains locked to Valen’s withdrawn sensorium. One register wobble—“shivering bliss cascade”—edges toward purple, but the cadence serves the dissolution beat, keeping 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)

    Third-person limited stays lashed to Elara’s tool-hand perception: gears, limestone breath, mineral drip. Sentence rhythm accelerates across the stepping-stone sequence—short clauses, present participles—mirroring her syncopated heartbeat. No filter-verb clusters; “she retrieved her measurements” is the lone cognitive verb before action replaces abstraction. Voice modulation under stress is precise: the tumble on the third stone compresses diction to “arms wheeling,” then expands again once footing returns.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices heat, mass, and the exact hue of copper glow.

Voice remains distinct under peak stress, achieving charged poise in the final chord.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual quirks—numbers (seventy-three vials), scent cataloging, psychometric synesthesia.

One minor filter-verb cluster (“he saw…he saw…”) but compressed enough to read as stress strobe rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice fuses lyric compression with alchemical precision—“salt-rotted shacks,” “naked architecture of cause and effect”—maintaining perceptual signature under pressure.

Rhythm modulates—long sentences for archival ritual, fragments at ingest (“He closed his eyes… falling upward”)—mirroring metabolic uptake of the city’s dread.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric-accumulative voice taught early (“breath crystallizing in fractal patterns”) and sustained; perceptual signature filters every phrase through chlorophyll-memory bias. No head-hop; entropy-decreasing songs keep lexicon within plausible mythic register.

No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Patterned elision (“borrowed-time existence measured in the gaps between heartbeats”) is taught early and paid off by the dissolving shard. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)

    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s perceptual signature: synesthetic, patient, slightly haunted. Syntax lengthens during contemplation then clips—“She understood now”—to mark beats. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon while reaching for lyric height.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Corvin’s perceptual signature—mineral, tidal, medicinal—governs diction (“calcified fingers,” “saline and regret”) and stays consistent under pressure. Compression like “incisively kind” is taught by repetition and paid off when he cuts dogma without wounding. Syntax lengthens then fractures in sync with the garden’s shift from rigid verticals to spiral doubt. No head-hopping; telepathic static is cleanly bounded to his granite sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, tightening to quasi-second-person in the whispered asides (“Up is down…”) that externalize her internal wobble. Syntax mirrors pendulum rhythm—long climbing sentences, abrupt proof fragments—then fractures in the rupture paragraph. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon until “coefficient of regret,” a momentary academic lift that feels earned by the mathematical turn. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent: she notices texture, temperature, asymmetry, never panoramic vistas.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Maya’s perceptual signature: moonlight is “warm” on eyelids, smog is “desperate breath,” turmeric in milk is the exact saffron quiet. Syntax lengthens and breathes with humidity; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The prose’s rhythmic control—long humid sentences that finally settle into the clipped “She set down the calligrapher’s brush”—mirrors her exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person retains curator’s perceptual signature—opera glass, catalog counts, rosewater scent—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“Through the green filter…”) then compresses under deadline (“She worked through the night”), rhythm matching pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity holds. Occasional elevated diction (“propolis,” “conceptual repricing”) fits educated exile; no register drift in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is sharp, marine, and clock-precise: “neatly inventive precision,” “geological sleep.” Syntax mirrors mechanism—balanced clauses like gear teeth—then fractures into luminous fragmentation at climax. Perceptual signature filters every image through engineer-calibrated attention; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct gothic-lyric texture: “wet silk,” “phosphorescent mold,” “luminance clung” all filter through Mara’s death-tainted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is surveyor-precise (“coordinates, measurements, fissures like broken staves”). Syntax lengthens underwater to mimic viscosity, shortens on shore for chill. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor engine is disciplined. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator lexicon, not Elara’s, but it occurs outside story text; interior voice stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias, with a perceptual signature attuned to textural minutiae (microscopic scoring, phosphorescent glow filtered through cracks).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Elias’s perceptual filter—"sharp eyes," "perpetually surprised expression," retinal overlay—never drifting to omniscience. Syntax lengthens under wonder and compresses under physical strain ("pull hard against centuries of oxidation"). Figurative register remains within his technical lexicon—"carrier signal," "linguistic code"—avoiding purple intrusion. No dialogue, so voice distinction across speakers is N/A; internal voice is singular and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person prose carries a perceptual signature attuned to texture and weight—salt, splinters, gilt—consistent with a genealogist who once traded in paper certainties.

Distinct diction sustains through the final sieved hush.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the negotiator’s perceptual filter—light angles, tide math, brass temperature—without leakage. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures into percussive clauses when shackles drop: “She inserted… each click… synchronized.” No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through weighted diction: “furrowed hush,” “tempered resolve.” The rhythmic final sentence mirrors lunar cadence, teaching the pattern and paying it off.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, consistent and cadence-controlled. Syntax mirrors swell and stroke (“rhythm of his strokes matching the flickering faith”).

Syntax lengthens under luminescent awe—“tendrils of luminescence wrapping her ankles”—then fractures at collapse (“wept”). No head-hopping; diction remains within her tactical lexicon. One clause risks over-precision—“conceptual repricing” feels academic, but it is the lake speaking, not the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric compression stays stable inside Elara’s perceptual filter; cosmic diction never drifts into abstraction but stays moored to tactile sap, pocket paper, heartbeat rhythm; no head-hop or register lapse under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric mode taught early via cathedral/groaning hull metaphor; pattern maintained. Perceptual signature: Elias notices through spiritual-material dichotomy (rust as regret, breath as prayer).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric third-person stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—lightning as “developing photograph,” scars as “topography.” Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under flash, teaching the rhythm early. No head-hop; diction remains within photographer’s lexicon. Voice modulation parallels chemical process without self-conscious poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Detached yet urgent omniscient voice mimics Victorian-scientific prose—“pneumatic precision,” “secret geometry”—matching the clockwork arm and cartographic obsession. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for contemplation, staccato parry lines for combat. No POV slippage; perception stays welded to Aldric’s engineer gaze. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Silas’s sardonic “You still believe…” versus Aldric’s declarative “I intend to turn…”

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “verses on cigarette papers,” “coffee tin clutched against his ribs.” Syntax stretches into cadenced fragments that mirror moonlit stillness without losing clarity.

Distinct航空-engineer-poet diction sustains across 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains precise psychic distance; diction (“spectrographic analyses of nightmare frequencies”) stays inside Elara’s empirical-whims lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—compressed clauses during storm break, longer cadences in pollen drift. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Just misses 9+ due to one slight register hop: “biochemical triggers designed to induce specific neural states” reads like abstract summary amid otherwise embodied prose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited cleaves to Mara’s slow, salt-weathered perception; rhythmic, oceanic syntax mirrors her cadence without monotony. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon (“rhythmically placid intervals,” “cerulean regret”); patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.
