  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: an artist's eye that sees "crystalline geometry," "lacework of ice," "fractal beauty," filtering all observation through form and light. POV distance remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction ("luminous," "maw of blackened brick," "drifting resonance") suits an artist-narrator without register drift. Purposeful compression in the week-long search montage ("One symbol corresponded…Another matched…") accelerates without losing clarity. Minor: "steadily adaptive" and "drifting resonance" phrases feel slightly elevated for peak stress moments, though voice texture holds.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elara; distance modulates purposefully (close during thermal work, brief pull-back for conservatory description). Perceptual signature is distinct: thermal colors, silence as texture, "phantom roar." Diction stays within her contemplative register; elevated phrases ("unshaken marvels," "silent symphony") read voice-motivated rather than imposed. No head-hopping. Brief filter verbs ("her gaze fell," "she believed") are acceptable and infrequent. Rhythm tightens during the projection sequence, then releases at closure. One minor slip: "her every gesture a carefully measured note" borders on tell, but context supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias's weary, undertaker lens filters the opening ("weariness was etched deeper"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("a map made of pressure and longing"). No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the descent), compression is acceptable and the internal texture holds. No dialogue; filter verbs are rare and voice-motivated. One minor slip: "inadvertently stubborn" feels like an externalized label rather than his own idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elara's leadership lens ("She became gently persistent," "stole the air from Elara's lungs"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("dog-eat-dog reality," "rusted gates," "gentle scrape of hoes"). The arbor declaration is quoted directly, allowing Elara's spoken register to differ from narration without head-hopping. Narrative stance modulates appropriately from exhaustion to cautious hope to resolve. Minimal filter-verb use; psychic distance tightens at key beats (bell discovery, arbor declaration).

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with perceptual signature ("a pilgrim of sparks," "the light that lived behind") consistent and character-particular. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Filter verbs ("she saw it") are minimal and do not dull immediacy. Slight elevation at peak beats ("shimmering motes," "tenacious beauty") fits the spiritual-artist lens without register drift. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinct ("sepia tone... already ghosting," "wash of static"). Diction fits the cerebral, obsessive focalizer ("monastic," "texture of time," "chronology"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the climax ("The fragment did not shatter; it simply ceased to be solid") supports urgency without obscuring clarity. Minor density in figurative language ("symphony," "cacophony," "silken threads") stays within voice and does not muddle peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's attention tracks chain vibrations, petal patterns, and gear sounds with professional patience. Diction is controlled and elevated ("cold iron ligament," "staggering grace") in ways that mostly fit the narrative stance. Weakness: some phrases ("chaotic jumble of keys," "beautiful noise of her victory") feel slightly generic under peak pressure, and the final paragraph's cadence risks summarizing rather than dramatizing the emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during forge work, pulling back for context). Perceptual signature is distinct—synesthesia colors every observation—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor ("chaotic lullaby," "sonic signature of a human heart cleaving in two") that reads authorial rather than character-particular under peak stress. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he understood") appear at transitions and fit voice; tense and stance remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV, stable third-limited with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is distinct (honeyed light, "illuminated moments") and vocabulary fits an art-educated thief. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "spectral, watery green glow") that sits just above immediate embodiment but remains within plausible reach for this character. No dialogue to judge. The final paragraph's "quiet custodian of possibilities" is a slight tilt toward authorial phrasing but anchored by the jar's concrete presence. Overall voice is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theatrical narration establishes a distinct perceptual signature and modulates convincingly under pressure (boom → whisper → choked final bow). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The exclamatory performance voice and the terse, frightened monologue at climax show controlled range. Minor register drift: "weighty lightness that promised not to drown her, but to carry her forward" in the final paragraph elevates into summarizing poeticism that slightly undercuts the embodied texture of earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person, and Leo's perceptual signature—fear-driven noticing, stunt-trained adaptiveness—colors the narration: "the cold metal...bit into my palms," "my claustrophobia a hot pulse." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the cipher work. Julian's single line of dialogue is appropriately smooth and pleasant, fitting his actor persona. Minor diction slips occur under peak stress: "burning focus," "violent, powerful certainty" feel slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but the core voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Kaelen's perceptual signature is consistent (watchmaker precision, metaphysical focus, sensory sorting). Diction matches the elevated, contemplative register throughout: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "bruised twilight" create a coherent atmospheric texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. The prose modulates appropriately—measured during preparation, intensifying as the star fades, easing into completion. One minor slip: "the secret of his order" introduces a collective without prior setup, momentarily blurring focalization, but recovers quickly. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong; compression serves the ritual's mounting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Unit 734's mechanical perception: "optical sensors adjusted," "logic processors could not parse," "internal vision." Diction balances technical precision ("high-bandwidth interface," "temporal mechanics," "data port") with emerging interiority ("achingly familiar," "gentle unfurling"). The perceptual signature is robot-specific—powers of two feel significant, error warnings are bypassed calmly, the world is parsed as data streams. Distance modulates purposefully: clinical during routine sweeping, tighter during the interface attempt. Minor slip: "achingly familiar" in paragraph three briefly exceeds what a machine consciousness would articulate before the breakthrough, though it can be read as narratorial coloring of Unit 734's growing pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is controlled and diction matches a reflective, educated register. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("the city exhaled after a downpour," "the only currency between him and Elias was the dense, ringing silence"), though under peak pressure the register remains elevated rather than compressing to urgency. "Crystal whispering" recurs with purpose but borders on ornamental at first mention.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature tied to Elias's craft knowledge (wisteria, hedgerows, fermented poultice). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though phrases like "landscape of blooming, withering grace" in the final paragraph risk elevated register at a quiet closure beat. Dialogue is minimal and functional (the manager's dismissal). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during marble ritual, wider during the butterfly arrival to capture collective awe. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference). The retrospective fungal-rot passage anchors in present memory and tilts present stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct ("obliging," "mechanically warm," "icy warmth"). Aris's dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven, though brief. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at the lever pull and the hologram shift. Minor register drift appears in "co-existing moments rather than a single, forward-marching line" and "inextricable" phrasing, which edges toward exposition, but the perceptual signature (mechanic's hands, tool awareness) holds throughout. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is musician-specific ("skeletal ribs," "unstruck chords," melodic language). Diction is controlled and purposeful, modulating appropriately under pressure. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated/literary phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound ("wraiths," "velvet darkness it had earned"). Free indirect style is generally clean, though "The ghost was at peace, and Elias, at last, had his song" reads slightly expository for the closing beat. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Elara's "wide, soft net" filters everything through meteorological precision and peripheral awareness. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction matches her interior lexicon (oracle/parsed/data set) without register clash. Minor deduction: "fault-tolerant oracle" and "waveform" risk academic drift, though they're voice-motivated enough to remain legible. Free indirect style is clean; the final sigh and placement beat carry subtext without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable first-person with strong perceptual signature: "devouring dark," "porous and strange," "sleeping iron beasts." Distance modulates purposefully—close during confession and valve scene, slightly pulled back during radio exposition. The protagonist's diction ("religiously skeptical," "bizarre interpretive lens") fits an educated, introspective voice under stress. No head-hopping. Minor slip: some filter verbs ("I heard it," "I thought of") could be tighter, but they don't dull immediacy at closure. The psychic's "soothing baritone" and the woman's "tinny and frantic" voice provide auditory texture without dialogue, maintaining voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with close psychic distance. Voice is distinct and lyric: "dust of ages was the only air fit to breathe," "liquid starlight," "witness to the river, a constant, unchanging change." Diction remains within the keeper's elevated, archaic register throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory details filtered through centuries of solitude. Filter verbs ("I had started to grip," "I was not the keeper") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence length modulating to match emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with access to his interiority and filtered perception of Lena. Voice carries a calm, therapeutic register consistent with his character. Two issues lower the score: (1) diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo abstraction ("beneath the hush of dreaming roots," "ordinary magic") that feels authorial rather than Elias's specific mental idiom, and (2) dialogue is minimal but functional—his lines advance the ritual without subtext or resistance. Psychic distance control is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled. Kaelen's perceptual signature—"feel the ghost of the ink, the pressure of the pen"—is distinct and consistent. Diction is elevated but suits the "odd historian" voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the diary reading, pulling back for the final reflection). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with psychic distance controlled throughout. Narrative diction ("cryptic fortune cookie writer," "conspiracy of goodwill," "symphony he had been composing for years") is elevated and metaphor-dense, reading as authorial rather than Elias's urgent interiority. Perceptual signature is clear (lighthouse perch, binoculars, typewriter clicks), and the final beats modulate effectively. No dialogue appears. The prose voice is distinct but occasionally drifts into literary self-awareness ("the familiar enigma of his life felt particularly sharp") that undercuts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited focalization through Alistair is stable and apt, with perceptual signature evident in his attention to "careful pauses between heartbeats" and "muffled clarity." Diction remains controlled—"rhetorical devices," "chiasmus," "axiom"—fitting a philosophical exorcist without jarring. The entity's voice ("dry rustle," "dead weight") contrasts with Alistair's measured tone and Elara's hoarse whisper at the end. Minor: "the patient, searching pressure of his method, probing the entity through rhetorical devices" edges toward exposition, though it stays anchored in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent and texturally distinct: "chronologically homesick, longing not for a place but for a when" and "upturned hush, a pre-dawn stillness that felt like a held breath" show purposeful diction and rhythm. Focalization remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Under peak stress ("The pressure in the air vanished"), the prose compresses appropriately. One slip: "reverse-engineering a soul to find its source code" mixes metaphors (soul/code) and the register drifts slightly elevated at moments of mystical claim, though it remains within Kaelen's intellectual idiom. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Kael throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: the viaduct's light, the tablet's runes, the fractured echoes filter through his awareness. Diction is generally controlled, though "darkening brightness" and "periodically eternal" edge toward philosophical abstraction that strains the focalizer's idiom under crisis. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening in the final acceptance beat. One small slip: "his unnatural buoyancy was gone" tells the reader what Kael would feel rather than showing the bodily jolt of sudden weight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara's deafness: "audibly muted," "the world through the soles of her worn leather boots," "a physical presence, a tremor in the bones." Diction is purposeful and elevated but consistent. Minor register drift at "meticulously crafted ghost" and "aching, beautiful space between them" where the narrator's vocabulary exceeds Elara's embodied experience in the moment without clear purposeful distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature is meteorological ("decay," "pressure system," "predictive curve"). Distance modulates purposefully: cool observation in paragraph one, tighter interiority when he feels "chilling clarity." Diction remains character-specific ("barometric pressures," "ventilation shafts," "anemometer") without register drift. Sentence rhythm accelerates as pressure builds: the final paragraph's short declaratives ("He would need...") propel the closure. No dialogue to judge. One slip: "credibly curious nature" reads slightly essayistic rather than enacted, though it precedes rather than replaces the dramatized approach to the bird.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "a student of cosmic choreography," "the cruel fulcrum." POV remains stable in close third; psychic distance is appropriate. Dialogue with the being is spare and purposeful, carrying philosophical subtext. Under peak pressure (the choice moment), diction elevates slightly ("spooling out," "subtle, rising tide") but remains within poetic register. The perceptual signature—pattern-seeking, metaphor-driven—is consistent, though some lines ("an answer that was also a question") approach abstraction without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "groan of settling silt," "whisper of her own blood," "horsehair tasting the saline air." Distance remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent—elevated but organic to a world of "mendicant's bowl" and "phantom warmth." The narrative modulates appropriately under pressure: longer, contemplative syntax early ("a reminder that even in a drowned world, there was something to receive") compressing to immediate perception during the music sequence ("She felt it more clearly").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Diction is controlled and distinctive: "the world's unseen skin," "cold, dense stone," "the quiet house of his mind." The perceptual signature is consistent—sensory detail filtered through a craftsman's precise attention. Under peak stress (the transfer), the prose maintains its texture without collapsing into generic intensity. No dialogue, so voice is carried entirely through narration; it holds a singular, slightly elevated register appropriate to Kael's profession and temperament. Minor: "affectionate detachment" in the final beat leans slightly tell-y, though it echoes the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias with controlled psychic distance. His diction ("tallied tonnage and tariffs," "shrewd composure") is character-specific and maintains register under pressure. Alina's dialogue ("Wasn't the third movement magnificent tonight?") carries natural subtext. Minor slip: "cautious exuberance humming just beneath the surface" is a filter-heavy construction that dulls immediacy, and "sea mist" in "her voice soft as sea mist" feels decorative rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Kaelen's artisan lens ("secrets of forgotten places," "damp hollows"). Lyra's brief dialogue-free interaction (gesture, smile, polishing cloth) maintains distance without head-hopping. Diction stays character-particular ("luminescent ache," "feverish clarity," "practical prayer"), though "boldly sympathetic" in paragraph two tilts toward prompt-label rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance is controlled; the final paragraph's shift into present-continuous ("looks from...feels") modulates appropriately for closure without breaking the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV held cleanly throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevates appropriately ("metronomic rhythm," "dissonant energy," "temporal lattice") without breaking Elias's illustrator lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: he observes patterns, sketches mentally, and decodes visual/sonic cues. The narration includes one filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("adjusted," "poised," "rested") but remains voice-motivated and does not flatten immediacy. No dialogue; all pressure flows through observation and action. Psychic distance is stable; the final reflection ("He had learned...") fits the illustrator's habit of documenting but edges toward summary rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elian's perceptual signature: "His magic was a gently inventive thing, less about commanding elements and more about persuading them." Diction remains consistent and character-specific (geometric grief, "living theorem of light and shadow"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("believed," "sought") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the channeling beat. Minor slip: "breathtakingly complex structure" in the visualization paragraph edges toward elevated register but stays within the narrator's established idiom of precision and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is distinct (he "feels" information echoes, navigates by "innate knowledge"). Prose modulates effectively from methodical opening to charged discovery to quiet satisfaction. Diction ("liminal," "archaeology," "phantom hand") fits his contemplative interiority. No dialogue present to test, and no head-hopping. Slight filter-verb density in peak beats ("he felt the ghost," "he saw her eyes widen") dulls immediacy but does not obscure; elision (skipping Elias's full retrieval process) is purposeful and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's professional-naturalist perspective. Diction remains character-particular: "circuitously sincere," "datapoint, he told himself," "questing for something new to grasp." The dialogue to lavender ("You see, some things resist being put back exactly as they were") carries subtext and reflects his indirect processing. Free indirect style is clean. One minor wobble: "It was the vine's behavior, not his own stubborn effort, that held the answer" slightly elevates register at a peak beat, though it remains within Elias's educated idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "haggard awe," "rickety," "wryly earnest"—diction aligns with a weary, self-aware artist. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext (the woman's flat "I don't have much" versus Elias's deflection). Minor filter-verb stack in the opening ("trying to," "trying to capture") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the exchange beat. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in Lyra's close third with consistent perceptual bias (scrying, musical sensitivity). Diction is controlled and apt ("discordant note," "fearful jailer"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Kael's lines pursue his goal without over-explanation. Some filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but are voice-motivated. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("profound mystery that wasn't menacing, but illuminating") that edges toward meta-commentary. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the shadow-merge climax. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV throughout with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Kaelen reads "patterns of barnacles" and "water-worn shoes" as archival data. Narrative diction matches his profession ("liminal space," "compile fragments into meaning") without becoming pompous. The woman's dialogue carries distinct voice ("north-gate horn") and subtext (the unfinished trumpet sequence). Minor slip: "ocean-spray archivist" in the opening reads slightly label-forward, though the specificity earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is strong (analytical/artistic mind sees "deliberate language" in cracks, "silent, stony dialect"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("the hour that divides bad habits and new starts," "a cathedral of space and revelation"). Brief register drift in peak beats: "the core concept of his life's work" and "the dare had not been a challenge to find a location" read slightly expository, but the voice remains coherent through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance throughout; Elias's perceptual signature (preferring "bedrock facts," cataloging ghosts) remains consistent and modulates appropriately under storm pressure. Diction stays character-appropriate—"skeletal remains," "salt-laced wind," "courageously kind hands"—with rhythmic control that tightens during the transcription beat. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The phrase "courageously kind" is slightly elevated but reads as narrator coloring rather than POV leak, and the rest of the voice holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and cosmic in scale, fitting the immortal protagonist's perspective. However, register occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("the overture to his masterpiece," "a quiet unraveling of physical law") that feels more essayistic than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (dimensional awareness, eons of memory) but could be more idiosyncratic. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises, tightening toward the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "deathly vitality," "porcelain stillness," "fever dream" logic fit Elara's mortician lens and calibrated interiority. Diction remains character-specific under pressure ("predatory stillness," "bizarre parody"). Dialogue is minimal and functional ("It is time"). One slip: "liquefies rigid thinking" in paragraph four momentarily exits her concrete professional register into meta-awareness; the phrase reads more like prompt vocabulary than earned insight. Otherwise, psychic distance and focalization are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent ("Her world had shrunk," "Her entire being was focused"). Diction stays within Elara's studious register ("cartographer," "carrier wave," "nascent sunlight") without slipping into corporate idiom. The rhythm modulates purposefully: long, patient sentences in the ritual description compress to short beats at the climax ("This was the moment"). Free indirect style is clean throughout. No dialogue to evaluate. Peak-stress compression when her pencil flies maintains voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: acoustic filtering, synesthetic color assignments, and a preference for tactile metaphors ("grain of a past," "gauze of fresh grief"). Distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("caesura," "phantom history," "the event"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: reflective at opening, immersive during the layering beat, then withdrawn at closure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applied. The piece uses free indirect thought cleanly ("Was it mine? A mistake?"). One minor slip: "the woman's sorrow, the man's wonder" lists emotions without embodying them in that sentence, though prior beats dramatize both. The perceptual specificity and rhythmic control under pressure meet the 9+ quick test, but that single list and the reliance on color labels cap the score at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and stable: "grand tomb for forgotten questions," "quiet theater where he reimagines," "gloomy cheerfulness." POV modesty holds—Elias infers, doesn't claim omniscience. Psychic distance tightens at closure ("his heart hammered," "trembling arm") without head-hopping. Diction remains character-particular: myth-buster turned restorer, scientifically precise yet open to the ineffable. Rhythm modulates: long, contemplative sentences in setup compress to shorter, pressured beats during the experiment, then expand again at the reflective close. No dialogue present; not required.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with controlled psychic distance and a distinct narrative texture ("anarchic soul," "torment of a dual allegiance"). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Kael's pitch to Zola is goal-driven and carries subtext ("They see us as chaos...a structure they can't see"). Perceptual signature reflects Kael's orderly mind (charting paths, intuitive mapping). Register occasionally drifts slightly elevated ("phantasmagoric beasts," "sanitize their home into oblivion") but remains within an educated focalizer's lexicon. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen's technical attention ("thermal seals," "phosphorus-binding proteins") and reverent tone remain consistent. Diction matches his role (inspector, inheritor of nightwatch tradition) and the psychic distance narrows appropriately during the bloom. One minor slip: "a profound, dawnlit melancholy washed over him" edges toward summary-tell in a peak beat, but the surrounding embodied detail (camera shutter as "soft, reverent *thump-clack*") recovers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: tactile focus, vibrational language, no visual dependency. Distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches what Elara can know through touch and sound. Diction is elevated but consistent: "magnetic calm," "molecular level," "harmonious pulse." The single line of dialogue from the harbormaster is functional and brief. Under peak stress (final repair), prose remains controlled without compression artifacts. Elara's way of noticing—through vibration and tactile memory—is character-specific and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with strong perceptual signature: Elias notices through his cartographic lens ("corroded," "drift," "static places"). Diction remains consistent—professional but not clinical. The single line of dialogue ("Glad one of us enjoys the weather") carries his dry wit and isolation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the frost-map sequence. Minor issue: "worrying tranquility" as a descriptor feels slightly authorial rather than character-filtered, though it doesn't break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("infinitely patient," "profound hum," "sculptor of echoes") that reads as omniscient narrator rather than Elias's direct perception. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic—he listens, observes, walks—without idiosyncratic bias or voice-driven compression under pressure. The prose carries a distinct textural choice (formal, incantatory) that remains legible, but the distance never modulates with emotional intensity, leaving the voice controlled yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent distance; perceptual signature (scientific terms like "capture matrix," "resonant frequencies") anchors voice. Diction control is strong under pressure, and the compression ("a wisp of silent light") fits the register. Minor deduction: no dialogue to test distinction, and some phrases ("maelstrom of sensation," "hurricane inside me") lean generic at peak stress rather than character-particular. The elision of submersible mechanics is purposeful and serves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is consistent, textured, and controlled: "a rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea to the gray sky," "copperlight repose," "shadows held their breath." POV remains single and stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during discovery, slightly elevated at the framing reflection). One slip: "motivated to thread this labyrinth with your own story" shifts to second person ("your") mid-sentence, breaking focalization. Diction matches the literary-reflective register throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is distinct (emphasis on silence, texture, historical weight).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, with interiority anchored in concrete cues (touching the bead, seeing the hem, feeling the chime in his bones). Perceptual signature is present: Elian notices alchemical plants by name, registers the ghost bride's influence on growth and toxicity, and filters the finale through his recovered memory. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "mournful elation," "spectral executor") that feels slightly imposed rather than organically Elian's lexicon under pressure. Purposeful compression in the memory sequences ("a vow whispered under a different sky") is legible and serves the accumulative design. The prose modulates well between the long quiet winter and the crescendo moment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and poetic ("orchid solace," "bone-white memories") but reads as narratorial voice rather than Kaelen's direct interiority, creating slight register distance. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-particular—some phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic spirit," "quiet, fervent prayer") trends toward external characterization. Purposeful compression in the storm sequence supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (warm curiosity, filtering decay through faith-restoration lens). Diction remains controlled and within Elara's plausible register. The prose modulates purposefully from meditative walks to the sharp understanding at discovery. Minor slip: "a profound hollowness where her faith in their stories should have been" and "cautious enchantment" edge toward diagnostic vocabulary, though they stay character-bound. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present: Kaelen notices "the holographic ghosts of yesterday's high scores," "the rough concrete a stark contrast to the sterile perfection." Diction remains controlled and purposeful, though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("monoliths of silent gold," "pathway for someone he'd never met"). No dialogue to test voice distinction. Focalization is clean with no head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focused on Elara's perceptions throughout. The prose carries a distinct texture—"spidery fingers," "ghost-stitch," "freighted with what she knew"—that reflects her embroiderer's lens. Diction is elevated but consistent with an educated, reflective narrator; no unmotivated register shifts. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests are waived. The narration maintains appropriate psychic distance and filters all observations through Elara's priorities (stitchwork metaphors, intuitive leaps). One minor slip: "the General's ambition, the new guards' loyalty" edges toward narrative omniscience rather than strict inference, though it reads as Elara's deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with brief access to Kael's reaction. Voice is distinct: "stones rubbing together underwater," "temporal stillness heavy with the ghosts of words." Psychic distance shifts intentionally when Kael's vision is rendered ("seeing her face, hearing the unspoken promise"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Register occasionally elevates beyond the scene's visceral need: "surplus of fear," "luminous truth" read slightly polished for peak-stress moments, though not fatally so.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decryption, zooms slightly out for the General's entrance). Perceptual signature is strong: translator's instinct to "unknot meaning," bias toward bridging. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Anja's syrupy speech and the General's clipped tone distinguish voices. Minor: "lotus-hearted ache" is a slight register lift but remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; filter verbs appear but fit the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—artist's eye filters moss, espaliers, color bleeding—and diction remains apt ("vaporous world," "spectral fruit," "phantom limb"). The daydream frame is taught in the opening line and maintained without confusion. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the painting beats: "Frustration pricked at him" is embodied, not diagnosed. Minor: some phrases ("soft-edged logic of his own mind," "ephemeral archives") edge toward elevated register, but they remain voice-motivated and legible under the lyric mode the piece teaches.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature—methodical cataloging ("cataloged the changes, noting the shift in harmony"), playful experimentation—remains consistent under pressure. Free indirect style is clean ("Panic was an option, but not a useful one"). Diction stays apt for a restorer-artisan without register drift. The apprentice's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor deduction for "the smile of a man who had traded a single world for multitudes," which edges toward narrator commentary rather than strictly focalized perception, though the line remains within plausible reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; distance tightens effectively at peak moments ("eyes alight with feverish intensity"). Dialogue carries subtext ("Even the brightest faces eventually turn from the sun") and pursues goals. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("machinations of a thousand tiny messengers," "candidly cryptic art") that clashes with the urgency of the scene. Aris's interiority is narrated with unearned certainty: "her thoughts a frantic, expensive buzz he could almost feel" reads as emotional ventriloquism rather than Kaelen's inference.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric register that matches Elara's poetic nature: "nacreous walls," "calcium cathedral," "phantom limb of the soul." Psychic distance is consistent, and perceptual signature is distinct—everything filtered through metaphor and craft vocabulary (photosynthesize, ensconce, crystallized despair). The prose modulates subtly under pressure: the tone softens at the armistice moment, and sentence rhythm loosens slightly when peace arrives. No dialogue; no head-hopping. The diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("intricate beauty sorrow creates"), but it reads voice-motivated rather than register-break, and the final image ("serene, unending creation") holds the established voice without explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance and perceptual filter are consistent. The prose carries distinct texture—"captive light of forgotten dawns," "petrified air," "lungs of a thousand ghosts"—though several high-register metaphors cluster in peak beats without full voice-motivation (does a solitary caretaker think in such densely poetic terms under pressure?). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("alchemy of sound and sorrow," "profound silence") that risks distancing the reader from Elian's immediate experience. No dialogue present to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in Kaelen's close third throughout with strong perceptual signature: scholarly precision, magical mechanics filtered through his expertise, emotional stakes tied to past failure. Diction stays consistent ("cathedral-quiet," "symphonies of truth," "cascading chain of commitment") with purposeful elevated register matching his academic milieu. The shift to Elara's interiority in the final paragraph is clean and motivated—her witness completes the arc without head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates well from tight interiority during inscription to slight pull-back for her entrance. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV with stable third-person limited focalization and a distinct perceptual signature (machinist's lens: "pressure and release," "groans of stressed metal"). Vocabulary ("thermal expansion," "surveyor's chain," "azurite") fits the character's expertise. Psychic distance is consistent, though some interiority leans explanatory ("a puzzle left for a mind that understood puzzles"). Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("his resolve dappled with the creeping dawn light") that feels more authorial than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; distance modulates purposefully (close in ritual, wider in reflection). Perceptual signature is character-specific: "dust-stars," "a bloom too fragile," "words tasting like ash." Dialogue is minimal but natural. Anna's brief lines carry subtext. Free indirect style is clean. The fabricated-histories device is voice-consistent and advances interiority. Minor: "her smile the first ray of sun after the storm" is a stock image that momentarily flattens the otherwise distinct texture at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single tight POV; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: Elian notices grain, light patterns, and weather code—his father's and grandfather's tools shape how he sees. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("featherly determined," "fractured hush," "spacial sheer" from the logbook register). Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decoding, slightly distant in the silver void's calm). Minor: "sinking into still water" is a touch generic for the threshold-crossing sensation; one more concrete sensory detail there would sharpen the perceptual signature at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelen; no head-hopping despite access to Elara's reflection in the dome. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees systems as living (city "breathes slowly," energy as circulatory). Some elevated diction ("palpable force field," "shadowseam wonder") reads slightly ornamental but doesn't break voice. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and distinct (Elara's curtness vs. Kaelen's calm). The phrase "his approach was softly ingenious" intrudes as author assessment rather than dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Kael's perceptual signature (professional, methodical, emotionally buoyant) stays consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "Such a shame to be so incomplete," "cheerful gloom," the three-note hum. The narrative confidently withholds the traveler's true fate until Kael discovers it, maintaining focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the climax (geode "flared," emotional echo "roared") to match intensification. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("wondered aloud," "murmured") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds stable; POV modesty is consistent (Kael's certainty about mechanics is earned by his prior charting). Perceptual signature is analytical and poetic ("loom, weaving threads of probability"). Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "orchestrated serendipity" and "calculated wilderness" edge toward authorial summary. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent. The couple's interior wonder is observed, not accessed, maintaining clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, third-limited, with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices gaps, pauses, absences. Diction is elevated and consistent ("obsidian grace," "opalescent light"), fitting a dancer-mystic focalizer. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the anchoring beat ("sudden, immense weightlessness that was also a profound weight") is legible and voice-motivated. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear but do not dull immediacy. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the dance and slowing at the anchoring moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; Silas's perceptual signature (glazier's lens, light-bending metaphors) is distinct and consistent. Diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "fundamental grammar of the world") elevates appropriately for a reflective craftsman. However, "a reflective man by trade and by nature" and the phrase "reads between the lines" edge toward meta-commentary. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the pond and final image, maintaining voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias. Perceptual signature is consistent: firefighter attention to heat, structural integrity, "smoldering log." Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—"Your wife?" and "That box...was it in a fire?" advance plot economically. "It was the fire" is a strong voice beat. Some phrases trend elevated ("tributary carved by a flashover," "brutal bargains they would win") but remain within firefighter-instructor register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider framing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable, third-limited to Elara, with a controlled perceptual signature that notices technical detail (needle tremor, recursive spirals) and interdimensional phenomena. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ethereal concepts," "quantum nudges," "staggeringly complex") but occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("repeatable, elegant proof") that feels slightly above embodied interiority. Psychic distance is maintained, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose reflects her analytical stance, though the voice could carry more idiosyncrasy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's perceptual signature is consistently filtered through her professional lens: "sigh of settling dust from the ghost of a footstep," "walls hummed with...anxiety." Diction remains stable and voice-particular ("corridor echo cartographer," "legacy's burden"). Distance is controlled throughout; no head-hopping. Minor slip: the scientist's diary voice ("the floods are my children") is vivid but borders on over-articulated poetic register for a person mid-breakdown, though it remains within plausible bounds for a precise, scientific mind under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, elevated register that fits the mirage painter's perceptual signature: "the perfect convergence of water, stone, and fading light," "liquid rainbows," "borrowed heartbeat." Distance is controlled; narration stays within what he can perceive and intuit. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. The syntax modulates well (longer descriptive flows during setup, tighter beats during the ritual, brief declarative closure). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The piece sustains a distinct perceptual stance—art-making as quiet communion—without artifice or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization through Elias is stable and controlled; no head-hopping into the generals' interiorities beyond what Elias observes. The diction is elevated but consistent with Elias as a diplomat-negotiator ("operatively gentle," "midsummer air thick with the scent of night-blooming jasmine and decay"). Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("Sign this with ink…"). However, some phrases drift toward register inflation during peak beats: "the hard lines of his face seemed to soften, to crumble like the terrace around them" reads slightly over-written for the moment's urgency. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices skepticism and exhaustion, filters setting through ritual significance) and psychic distance modulates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elias's precise, guilt-charged perception: "the calligraphy of cracks," "twilight sky, speckled with...frozen embers," "layers of ruthless pragmatism." Diction stays elevated but character-specific, matching a technocrat haunted by memory. Syntax tightens under pressure ("For a moment, he held the last of a species against the sterile silence") and the final paragraph modulates to quieter cadence without losing voice. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with Elara's poetic discipline—diction like "spectral residue," "psychic weight," and "untangling threads" reads character-appropriate for a courtesan who trades in invisible currencies. Perceptual signature is selective: she notices "vibrations," "echoes," and "threads" rather than physical detail, filtering the world through her mystical work. Minor strain: phrases like "alarming serenity" and "bodily poetic" occasionally feel externally imposed rather than internally experienced, and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("not a revolution of swords, but of whispers") slightly breaks the intimate focalization established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct: "calligrapher's precision," "perfectly rendered ideogram," diction matching Kaelen's urbane artistic sensibility. Elara's shouted dialogue contrasts effectively with Kaelen's interior restraint. The phrase "detonated in the minds of his audience" and "vivisectionist of the soul" occasionally drift toward slightly elevated metaphorical register, but remain voice-plausible for an artist reflecting on craft. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately from heated argument memory to serene decision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Elias's scholarly yet tactile sensibility ("esoteric realist," "quiet cadence"). Diction is elevated but consistent: "blushing stillness," "filigree of dust and light," "prayer tied with the quiet reverence of a scholar." Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in his attention to materials and method. Slight register drift into poetic abstraction ("the memory of the earth itself") risks decorative feel but remains voice-coherent. No dialogue; narrative voice modulates gently with the monarchs' arrival and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elian's artisan perspective: "technically gentle," "reverent purpose," "surgeon's precision born from the memory of clumsy, grieving hands." Diction is elevated but consistent; perceptual signature is craft-focused (threads as notes, holes as absence). One slip: "his action was complete; his task now was to illuminate" reads slightly authorial/expository rather than Elian's own idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable; Kael's perceptual signature—past and future crisp, present smeared—is distinct and controls what he notices. The prose texture modulates well from detached observation to embodied sensation at the end ("grit of the concrete dust," "cold and real"). One minor slip: "His hands, which he could only perceive through the memory of their shape and the premonition of their movement" reads slightly over-explained. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "hypnotic frugality," "empirically ironic," sensory filtering through an astronomer's lens. Diction is elevated but coherent ("clawed at the violet sky," "gossamer structure"). Minor slips: "a tomb awaiting a new corpse" and "the universe breathing in" edge toward generic literary metaphor rather than Kavi's particular idiom. No dialogue present; psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to interior devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited from Elara's POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("scarred architecture," "resonant frequency"), fitting the abstract cosmic frame. However, perceptual signature is generic high-register narration rather than character-particular; Elara's way of noticing does not reveal contradictory impulses or personal bias. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The phrase "reappears when needed" borders on meta-commentary and distances the reader from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-POV narration maintains psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara's craft (silver, glass, silica, heat). Diction remains controlled and purposeful; elevated register ("liminal," "filigree," "sympathetic") fits the lyric mode without clashing with her artisan identity. The prose modulates naturally from workshop anchor to ritual intensity. Filter verbs ("believed," "felt") appear sparingly and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Rhythmic control tightens during the breathing sequence and relaxes in the final paragraph, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; Elian's perceptual signature (quartz-eye showing stress fractures, sensory focus on stone and blossom) is consistent and character-specific. Diction modulates with emotional intensity: "physical blow, knocking the air from his chest" at the ribbon discovery. Lyra's remembered dialogue carries distinct voice and generational contrast. Minor slips: "a wave of accidental wisdom washed over him" and "It was a beautiful scar, a fusion of old and new" drift into slightly elevated summary register that doesn't quite match the grounded tactile voice elsewhere. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with Kaelen's perceptual signature evident in his focus on temporal paradoxes and the orchard's beauty. Diction matches his role and state: "achingly empty," "frantic, beautiful chaos," "polishing it to a gleam." The voice modulates effectively from overwhelmed ("perpetually bewildered") to focused inquiry to final resolve. One minor slip: "a night-fused flower" and "un-memory" feel slightly elevated beyond the established register, though they remain legible. No dialogue present; interior texture is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Elara perceives the Scriptorium as "living composition," "unheard symphony," "negative space" detective work. Diction is elevated and consistent ("temporal paradoxes," "floral cryptology," "seamless, living rock"). The Curators' dialogue moment ("Your purpose...") advances the argument but reads slightly expository. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during research, slightly pulled back for the Curators' acceptance). Minor register drift: "renegotiate her terms" and "equation of risk" edge toward corporate diction in a fantasy frame, though not severely.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, poetic, and metaphorically dense ("fog tasted of salt and rust," "memories like watercolor paintings left in the rain"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The diction is elevated and character-specific, matching Elara's introspective, mythic framing of her condition. One deduction: under peak stress (the womb memory), the prose maintains its lyrical register without compression or degradation, which slightly flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed") appear frequently but are voice-consistent. Dialogue is absent, appropriately so for this solitary pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's professional perspective. Diction is controlled and distinct: "warmly methodical curiosity," "temporal anomaly ticking away," "meticulous act of translation." Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices archival details, cross-references patterns, handles objects with "practiced grace." No dialogue appears; the narrative voice modulates appropriately from measured calm to heightened precision during the weaving. Psychic distance remains steady; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent (Kaelen notices sonic and structural detail befitting a mapkeeper). Diction remains character-apt—"bloom of hush," "cartography of silence"—and the prose modulates with pressure, tightening during the ritual. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "a symphony of nullity" and "fortress of will" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, though they remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the narrative certainty matches Kaelen's expertise and current knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, with vocabulary and perceptual signature fitting a solitary scholar-custodian. Diction like "retrocognitively blessed" and "star-lanes" feels authentic to the speculative setting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the vision sequences, pulling back slightly for the assembly. Free indirect style is clean ("It couldn't be random. It was a map"). A few moments edge toward slight overwriting—"the object of his obsession resting on a velvet cloth" carries a touch of melodrama—but voice remains coherent under pressure and the prose texture stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: he perceives through archival metaphors ("sculpt identity," "temporal echoes," "resonant parchments") and experiences time as "preemptively nostalgic." Diction remains elevated but consistent ("stormlit," "spiderwebbed," "ozone-rich"), matching an archivist's lexicon. Psychic distance is controlled, tightening during the frantic measurement sequence. Purposeful compression ("They had stood on this very precipice") conveys the memory flood efficiently. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance. Kael's perceptual signature is fireworks-specific: he chants chemical formulas and color names, uses "ambient awareness," filters through professional habit. Voice remains consistent under pressure—ritual language intensifies rather than dissolving. Diction fits his artisan lens: "purposeful and functional beauty," "cascading bloom of sparks." The shift from chemicals to colors mid-search feels voice-motivated. One small register slip: "playing a serious game with the ghosts of this place" leans slightly elevated for crisis thought, but the phrase ties to the "serious playfulness" tone so reads purposeful rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in Elara's contemplative naturalist voice with consistent perceptual signature: "warmly observant," filtering pain through scientific analogy. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"miniature, violent ballets of tidal pools," "sightless burrowing." Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close observation and wider reflection. Minor slip: Kael's single line of dialogue feels slightly elevated ("Then it is decided") without clear character voice, though it's brief enough not to disrupt coherence. No head-hopping; filter verbs fit the meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices silences by flavor and texture, architecture by breath. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("His father's method...had given him a phobia") to immersive sensory present ("Mist coiled around his ankles"). Free indirect style is clean throughout. Minor texture issue: "a green and living tendril unfurling in the barren soil of his fear" edges toward elevated metaphor at a peak beat, though it remains within the lyric register established earlier. No head-hopping; focalization stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; distance is controlled and voice carries a calm, meditative register—"fluidly logical instrument," "vaulting hush." Dialogue is spare and purposeful: the woman's confession and Elian's instructions advance the teaching arc. Perceptual signature is selective and profession-tuned: he notices "the sound of light striking the prism edges" and "the ghost of the train." Brief filter-verb stacks ("He was teaching," "He saw the tension") slightly dull immediacy in high-instructional beats. Diction remains consistent; no head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Distance control is consistent, though the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("a breath away," "the morning light") that feels slightly generic rather than Elara-particular. Perceptual signature is present (sonic architecture recall, data-codex knowledge) but could be sharper under stress. The narrative certainty matches what Elara can know. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance remains mid-range throughout; compression under peak pressure (final insertion) is minimal, and the syntax does not modulate strongly with urgency. Free indirect style is clean where used.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with clean section-break switches between Elara and Liam; no head-hopping. Each segment's focalization is distinct: Elara's ritual precision versus Liam's suffocating passivity. Diction remains elevated and lyric ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper") but stays character-consistent and voice-motivated. The narration's perceptual signature—ash, starlight, phantom chill—is selective and purposeful. Minor: some filter verbs ("felt the echo," "felt the faintest vibration") slightly dull immediacy in the climax beats, and "tender shadow keeper" late-labels a role without earlier behavioral grounding in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara filters the Promise's temptations through the OmniVex memory ("the same hollow authority," "siren call"), and her interior voice balances technical grounding (data-slate, temporal anchors) with lived metaphor (conceptual bomb, crushing weight). The glitchy messages' fractured typography is a purposeful diction choice that teaches its own pattern. Free indirect style is clean, though "virtuously mischievous" edges toward descriptor convenience rather than fully dramatized texture; the phrase appears once without behavioral echo in the volunteer moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elara's perceptions with controlled psychic distance. Diction is elevated and literary ("eloquently silent," "flotsam of history") and remains consistent, though occasionally it drifts toward writerly ornamentation ("a weighty question in the still air") that feels more authorial than character-particular. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. The prose modulates well under pressure (short clauses during the hum's crescendo). One slip: the voice reads more as a crafted narrator observing Elara than as Elara's own perceptual idiom, reducing the sense of distinct interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelen with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear: he notices equations in light and sap, feels the glass panes' panic through his spine, and whispers allegiance rather than shouting oaths. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mystical-custodian voice. The single line of dialogue ("For the chance of what might be") fits voice and moment. Under peak stress (the storm crescendo), syntax compresses appropriately ("Now.") without breaking internal texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable and controlled; perceptual signature is consistently archivist-particular (dust patterns, paper resistance, raking light, acid-free protocols). Diction stays within Elara's lexicon (professional precision layered with grief metaphors) and modulates appropriately under discovery's pressure. Rhythm tightens at the unfurling beat ("The paper crackled in protest") and breathes at the ceremonial ending. Minor slip: "tactfully hopeful" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward therapeutic self-awareness, though it remains embodied in her actions with the sleeve and card.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and psychic distance controlled; narration remains Elara-bound with no head-hopping. Diction matches her interior (archivist's precision: "permacrete," "defunct," "node," "auric lagoon"). Perceptual signature is clear: she notices puddles, reflections, old graffiti, the scent shifts. Voice modulates with pressure: clipped syntax during the walk, slower rhythm in the lagoon. Filter verbs ("felt," "ignored") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: "It was not a map of streets, but of light" and a few passive constructions ("was underestimated," "was her only remaining weapon") slightly reduce propulsion in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; narrative distance matches Elias's ritual focus. Diction ("vested hush," "parasitic melody," "playing through negative space") is purposeful and voice-consistent, though occasionally elevated ("profound sense," "quietly vivid") in a way that edges toward lyric register without breaking clarity. Perceptual signature is selective—sound, light, and mist dominate—anchored in his saxophonist's ear. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance holds steady; the final paragraph's "eerie nostalgia" recurrence reinforces the established voice rather than drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature ("mossy delight in the precision," "breath caught in his throat") is consistent and voice-particular. Diction remains elevated but coherent: "confluence of ashen veins," "trembling precision," "profound and mossy delight." No head-hopping. The rhythmic control supports the meditative tone, though some phrasing risks purple register ("brittle as spun sugar," "impossible small moonstone cabochon dust speck"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reverent observation to intimate trembling at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "the quiet tick of broken things," cogs in loam, etchings skewed by degrees. Distance is stable third-limited; diction ("a logic that felt more like magnetism," "collapsing cathedral of glass") stays within elevated but character-appropriate register. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong ("he held his breath, nudging the rose"). No head-hopping. POV modesty holds; no withheld facts for artificial suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with Kael's perceptual signature consistent (alchemical vocabulary, professional focus on balance and transmutation). Diction stays within his lexicon—"esoteric alchemical axioms," "immutable laws," "reagents"—without register drift. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: syntactic compression during the ritual ("Sweat and tears mingled") contrasts with more elaborate reflection in calmer moments. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable, and Silas's perceptual signature (spiritual midwife, filtering through the tooth, calm against torment) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: his two questions pursue the goal of redirecting the spirit's focus. The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("luminous ache," "spectral confession") that fits the otherworldly premise. One rhythmic tic: several sentences open with "The [noun]" in the final third ("The spirit," "The single clear note," "The spectral harp"), creating brief template cadence that does not obscure but slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct and purposeful: proprioceptive precision ("micro-gram accuracy"), sensory sharpness, and memory-by-trauma-response. Diction remains within the focalizer's enhanced but grounded register; elevated phrases like "ultraviolet penance" and "mathematics of mercy" read as integrated conceptual anchors rather than external ornament. No head-hopping or filter clutter. Compression at peak moments ("not a fragment but the whole, terrible truth") supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters the market through professional expertise ("between-worlds translator," "essence") and personal history (grandfather, lighthouse). Diction is purposeful and controlled, with occasional elevated register ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant") that fits the character's contemplative stance. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor penalty: at peak pressure, the prose maintains uniform texture ("silent, wrenching pull, not of thread but of reality itself") rather than compressing under stress, and some phrasings ("brushed past my ear") lean stock. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Leo notices dust patterns, spectral residue, wiring diagrams, lift mechanisms—the world filtered through his dual expertise. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "liminal spaces," "phantom smell," "smudges of spiritual residue," "the drip of water somewhere deep." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the ghost encounter. The vocabulary (horologist, mainspring barrel, hoist cables) fits Leo's technical background. No head-hopping; the ghost's history arrives via vision-jolt, maintaining POV boundary. Rhythm varies with pressure: longer sentences during setup, shorter during the climb and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited focused on the Operator; psychic distance is controlled and diction remains elevated and consistent. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is thin—precision and economy are told ("movements were as precise and economical") but not shown through syntax or selective attention. The elevated register ("rustling awakenings," "fractal growth of the ice crystals," "implosion of meaning") is uniform across emotional peaks and valleys, flattening rhythmic variation. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice feels less like the Operator's particular consciousness and more like an external docent narrating the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "burnished sorrow," "caesura in a line of forgotten verse," "the past grew loud." Perceptual signature is consistent—Kaelen filters everything through his poetic/revolutionary lens. One minor slip: "his breath fogging the air" reads slightly generic for the heightened register established elsewhere, and "frozen light" in the shard description borders on stock metaphor. No dialogue on the page; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (short beats during the storm, longer reflection after). Reaches high band but a few decorative phrases ("museum of a world," "chorus of ghosts") lean toward stock lyricism without fresh turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric register ("covenant of rust," "tinkersong wonder") that suits the fabulist tone. Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "slick and corroded like old metal" and "pervasive lie" lean toward abstraction. The rust-voice's dialogue ("You are too small...") feels thesis-adjacent rather than naturalistic, yet it serves the conceptual stakes. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices gears, screws, light quality), and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax. No head-hopping. Minor register drift when the narration explains theme ("the ultimate falsehood") rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices by scent first, filters the cave through her collector's lens, and her interiority stays grounded in her eccentric method. The prose has texture ("petrichor," "geologic hinge," "captured aurora") and rhythm modulates cleanly from catalog precision to wonder. No dialogue. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "a profession of her own design" and "the method she rarely used, a psychometry reading" carry slight expository stiffness in the opening third; under pressure the voice tightens and the effect is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a sculptural attention to texture: "gnarled burl of cypress," "velvet-lined box." Psychic distance modulates appropriately from observation to crisis compression. Minor register slip: "timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity with simplicity," and "turbine-hum reverie" feel elevated beyond the moment's urgency, particularly in the opening where they read as thematic placeholders rather than Elara's lived idiom. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent focalization through Elara's artist's perception. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"amber pavilion," "bruised sky," "umbral tenderness"—that suits the quest-narrative tone. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "understood") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. No dialogue present to evaluate. One pressure point: the elevated diction ("liminal state," "choreography of light and shadow") occasionally drifts from visceral immediacy during discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable; Kaelen's perceptual signature—"the detritus of the shore," "heat-haze and memory-scuff"—is consistent and voice-specific. The narrative stance modulates effectively between the sterile zeppelin and the searing lagoon. Free indirect style is clean; diction ("reverie," "benediction," "parley") fits an archivist's lexicon under stress. One minor register note: "the burn of the reverie threatening to overwhelm him" leans slightly tell-heavy where embodied sensation could sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with controlled psychic proximity; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and alchemical ("volatile and intimate of alchemical laboratories," "crucible of his own mind") without unmotivated register shifts. Perceptual signature is strong: Kaelen notices sensory fragments (scorched sugar, rough net texture) and frames them through his craft. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—shorter syntax at the moment of first light ("A single paper lantern... flickered"), longer reflective sentences during setup—and the narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows. Filter verbs appear ("He could stare," "he could almost perceive") but are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy given the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV throughout; psychic distance is stable and close. Elian's perceptual signature (the scribe's focus on emotional tides, the memory as "mental frequency") is specific and consistent. Diction remains controlled: "velvet disquiet," "desiccated leaves," "cloying and funereal" all fit the scholarly yet sensory register. The dead-tongue dialect is motivated by his specialized vocation. Minor slip: "accidental prophecy born from the stylus's path" edges toward meta-commentary, but the phrase stays within Elian's interpretive frame. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly held to Elara's perception throughout. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the metaphysical inheritance premise, though register remains somewhat uniform under pressure—syntax does not degrade or compress during the peak gathering beat. Perceptual signature is consistent (memory as scent, light as laughter, feeling as touch) and voice-motivated. Minor deduction: "furiously tranquil" as simultaneous contradiction is declared rather than enacted in sentence rhythm or micro-choices; the prose maintains steady lyricism without the syntactic fracture or embodied contradiction that would ground the paradox on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent and textured ("credibly curious," "his conviction had grown from a seed of doubt"). Diction matches Elian's technical background and contemplative stance. The countdown sequence modulates psychic distance purposefully, tightening from reflection to immediate action. Minor issue: the phrase "threw the main breaker, a heavy, satisfying switch" slightly over-explains in a peak moment where gesture alone would carry the weight, and "supercharged clouds" reads as register drift into generic sci-fi phrasing rather than Elian's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature evident in phrases like "drifts of ancient starlight" and "moss on forgotten stone"—sensory details filtered through a custodian's spatial and temporal awareness. Psychic distance tightens during the empathic beat: "He felt the violent, frictional heat" compresses syntax and shifts to present-tense immediacy. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("primal elegance," "incandescent scream"), though "a deeply personal secret" edges toward exposition. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer contemplative sentences yield to short declaratives at closure ("He was still a janitor").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: "tranquilly perceptive study," "contextual clues," "reverence that felt like trespass" mark Elias's observational lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the box-opening, slightly wider at the ghost-dissolution. Voice texture is distinctive: "curdled into perpetual shock," "mute eloquence," "shimmering air" create a lyric cadence without obscuring clarity. Minor weaknesses: "It was a cornerstone of their tangled covenant" and "He believed that keeping them contained…" edge toward expository summary in the middle third, slightly dulling immediacy. Filter verbs ("he saw her change") are sparse and voice-motivated. Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon; no register drift. The final paragraph's rhythm supports closure without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and poetic, with controlled metaphoric density ("metallic wound spilling its secrets," "great, silent ocean of the present"). POV remains stable in third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Kael's tactile and visual focus on fragments and light). The garage sale descriptions demonstrate voice range and subtext. Register stays consistent except for one slip: "the sensation flooded Kael, not a sight or a sound, but a feeling—the 'texture' he had so longed to understand" uses distancing meta-commentary that slightly flattens the climax. Dialogue is absent; no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "volumes of story held in shell and stone," "burnished hush," "crisp edge." Psychic distance is stable third-limited, with Kaelen's perceptual signature (warmly attentive, fragment-seeking) governing selection. The prose modulates appropriately from quiet observation to the sharper note of the child's cry. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("melancholic sigh," "afternoon pivoting"), and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("Another dawn, woven from the dusk of a small grief, was complete") tilts toward summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's caretaker expertise ("calloused finger," "unhurried precision of a man who had tied a thousand grafts"). Diction is controlled and consistent: "brazen calm," "geological heartbeat," "viridian light." No dialogue; all interiority is concrete. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the closure beat ("he could feel it—a slow, geological heartbeat"). Minor register drift: "transforming the orchard into a single, symbiotic organism" reads slightly elevated for the embodied voice established earlier, though it remains within plausible lexicon for a botanically trained caretaker. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Aris's lens; perceptual signature is consistent (academic framing, resistance to poetics, embodied skepticism). Diction remains character-specific: "luminous skeptic," "psychogeographic resonance," "low-grade adrenaline of arrival" all fit his register. Under peak pressure in the tower, the prose compresses slightly ("understood then, with a clarity that felt both intensely logical and deeply intuitive") but the narrator's texture holds. The fly amber receives recurring focalized attention without filter clutter. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows appropriately at the realization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through the coachman's purposeful attention. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices fissures, soil texture, seed properties—what matters for his work. Diction is elevated but consistent ("chemiluminescent," "tabernacle," "submerged concord") and voice-motivated for a solitary ritualist. The birds' language is rendered as translated interiority ("The salt is too deep here"), clean free indirect. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during seed-planting, wider during birds' chorus. No head-hopping. Compression under pressure (final paragraph) maintains voice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent and distinct, balancing poetic compression ("wild hush," "tinted revelations") with concrete action. POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; Barrow's perceptions are inferred through behavior, not head-hopped. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decoding, wider during travel). Some elevated diction ("cascade of scratchy static," "soured in her throat") fits the lyric register and does not break character lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV distance is stable, with controlled free indirect style anchored to Elara's perception. Diction is purposeful ("star-dusted swirl," "syrupy waves") and reflects her temporal awareness. The vision sequence relies on summary claims ("She saw her great-grandfather...She saw the shutdown...") rather than dramatized perception, creating a tell-heavy passage at the climax. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress, but the final stance shift lacks rhythmic modulation—declarative certainty replaces earlier uncertainty without linguistic texture reflecting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Kael's perceptions and priorities. Diction is elevated but consistent ("viridian," "Crysolith," "petrified bone") and voice-motivated for a fantasy register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the climb and swap, pulling back slightly for thematic resonance at the end. Minor register tension: "sliver of impossible time that was twisting the celestial clock" is more concept-label than embodied perception. No dialogue present; voice remains singular and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara with clean focalization: "Elara felt the lie not in the words, but in the flicker"; perceptual signature filters setting through her historian's attention to "small gestures." Voice carries distinct diction ("nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence") that modulates under pressure without register drift. The Regent's single line of dialogue feels formal-declarative, appropriate to role. One brief moment—"She was benevolently ruthless"—reads more like authorial summary than Elara's perception, slightly loosening distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature—she notices "mercury" fractures, phantom scents, and the mountain as breathing entity. Distance modulates purposefully: close during stone contact ("her hand trembled"), pulled back during the conceptual turn ("she understood now"). Diction remains character-bound (vellum, cartography, petrified wood) with one brief elevated phrase ("harrowing trick") that fits the seer archetype. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control tightens during the feather-trace beat, then opens for the rooting imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Elias; perceptual signature (chess metaphors, slender fingers on labyrinth, prideful self-diagnosis) is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within an educated, reflective register appropriate to an exiled tutor. Minor deduction: phrases like "fierce repose he had cultivated" and "suffocating guilt" edge toward slightly elevated literary diction in a couple of beats, though they remain legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Diction is elevated and lyric—"forged hush," "marrow-paths," "refract"—which suits the conceptual stakes but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("that prison of endless echoes became her instrument"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Kael's rasped warning and Elara's counter establish stakes. Perceptual signature is present in her framing of sound as rebellion, though the prose sometimes prioritizes poetic texture over embodied immediacy under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent alchemical-lyric register. Perceptual signature is distinct: technical focus on "quicksilver-infused binder," "cartography of ruin," mixed with sensory anchors. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the heart crater, tightening from procedural to raw. Minor diction wobble: "dire enchantment of last chances" in paragraph one reads slightly elevated against Elara's self-deprecating voice ("spilled her tinctures"), though it recovers quickly and the closing lyricism feels earned by the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters the world through Elias's painter's sensibility ("grey moods of the sea," "colors he had mixed so carefully"). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful compression ("a man holding a memory so close it walled him off"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices light, color, and spatial composition. Minor register drift into elevated writerly diction ("intimately aloof," "cathedral of stone and light," "a study in being") reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure, preventing entry into the 8.5+ band. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with clean distance control. Perceptual signature is strong ("He believed in smaller things," focus on scent and memory). The captain's dialogue feels natural and advances plot, with distinct idiom. Minor issues: "a sound of profound relief" tells rather than shows, and "a screaming tenderness" mixes registers slightly (the phrase works thematically but feels author-voiced rather than character-filtered). No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature is strong: "obsidian sky," "skeleton of forgotten ambition," starlight feeling "solid." The midnight voice's rasping poetry ("Serpent's tooth," "frequency of solace") carries distinct register and advances plot. Filter verbs ("he thought," "he felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. Minor deduction: "It was a map he knew intimately" and "That energy, like his own strange sight" tell rather than show, and the phrase "maddeningly precise" asserts tone without dramatizing it. Under peak stress (placing the censer foot), diction compresses appropriately ("unnerving finality," "palpable warmth").

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close; perceptual signature is character-specific (truffle forager's eye for "symbiotic relationship," "powdered silicates," "non-conductive mineral"). Diction stays within Elias's rational, precise register even under pressure ("psycho-sympathetic resonance," "focal point," "occlude"). The dialogue exchange with the neighbor is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext: her question probes vulnerability; his answer withholds with purpose. Minor slip: "a bastion against the chaos" and "a place of precarious beauty" occasionally drift toward elevated summary rather than felt perception, slightly loosening immediacy in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; Silas's perceptual signature (light-keeper's observation, gaps as information) is distinct and consistent. Diction matches his thirty-year solitude: "borrowed memories," "a man made of absences," "a small, lonely monument." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during flower-contact, wider during exposition of the stranger's life. Minor slip: "He understood the eccentricity others saw in him" momentarily adopts external perspective without clear dramatization of that external view. Narrative stance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable and clean throughout. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elias notices mossy stones, pencil smudges, faint shimmer—details filtered through his antique-dealer lens and empirical nature. Diction fits the character (graphite, topographical, silicon matrix) without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during interiority, pulling back slightly for the doorway vision. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is controlled ("It was a ridiculous method, one his late wife...had scribbled"). Prose rhythm reflects his patient, methodical state, tightening slightly as the creek clock ticks. Minor slip: "the weight of his promise feeling heavier" uses a filter verb that slightly dulls immediacy in a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited with controlled psychic distance; Elara's perceptual signature—silk as shroud, grit as antidote to polish—is character-specific. The two dialogue lines ("We leave at dusk," "We are going down") carry subtext and closure weight. Diction remains within her register; the elevated phrasing ("lacy menace," "visceral filigree") reads voice-motivated. Minor: Kael's single whispered line lacks distinct idiom, though brevity mitigates.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's alchemist lens filters everything through equations and forms. Psychic distance control is clean in single POV. Dialogue naturalness holds ("It's empty," "Wait"). Minor register drift: "directed spontaneity" and "palette of resolve" feel slightly elevated for peak emotional beats, as does "unbearable weight of his imminent absence" when simpler diction might sharpen. Kael's voice is brief but distinct in quietness.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator notices knots in wood as "staring, judgmental eye[s]," filters memory through the lens of chronological confusion, and frames flight as "willed." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the jealousy spiral and expanding during the aerial view. Diction stays within a literary, introspective register consistent with a chronicler; phrases like "feral nostalgia" and "phantom ache of a future headstone" are voice-motivated. Minor slip: "obscene" (describing hope) and "artistry" feel slightly elevated compared to the earthier "scraped his knee" and "town sidewalk," but the effect is contained and does not fragment the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elara's perceptual signature: she reads "emotional terrain from the posture of a shoulder or the tremor in a voice." Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Voice modulates purposefully from the opening's meditative rhythm to the compressed, whispered reading ("There is tension here") to the final breath. Psychic distance tightens during the screw reading, then pulls back for the reflective closure. The old man's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I need you to humanize this for me"). Minor voice drift: "explosive first cry that recalibrated the universe" edges toward elevated diction not fully anchored in Elara's lexicon, though it's brief and doesn't disrupt the overall texture.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds consistently; psychic distance tightens under pressure (breath burning, focus fracturing). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "saturated hush," "latticework of old pains and future fears," "meticulously trimmed tip." The prose modulates from scholarly ("framework of logic and symbol") to intimate whisper ("Hesitation," "Pride") without head-hopping. Minor register drift: "saturated hush of the sky" and "profound stillness" occasionally elevate beyond immediate crisis perception. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is specific to a rune scholar under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; distance contracts during the sensory storm ("he felt everything… drowning in the connection"). Vex's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("gravel wrapped in silk," metaphoric precision) versus Julian's whispered interiority. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw nothing") are voice-motivated during the paranormal beat. Minor slip: "compositions, a library of his sister Elara's soul" reads slightly elevated for Julian's distressed state, though the phrase fits the gothic register overall.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is consistent: elevated, philosophical diction suits the archivist narrator. However, the register leans abstract even in high-pressure beats ("plenum of resolution," "placid machinery of its conclusion") without grounding in embodied perception. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is somewhat generic—no character-specific quirks of noticing—and the vocabulary stays in a narrow academic band throughout. Free indirect style is clean but lacks modulation under emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close; Elias's perceptual signature is consistent (engineer's precision, philosophical bent, sensory attunement to pressure and sound). Diction is elevated but fits the voice: "dissonance snagged," "awesome power," "freighted with memory." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the counting ritual, tightening at the discovery. Minor texture note: a few phrases ("cathedral of brass," "wild thing") approach stock metaphor but are recuperated by the glacial-specificity payoff. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; narrative distance is controlled and Aris's perceptual signature (probability lexicon, analytical framing) is present. Diction is mostly apt, though phrases like "stultifying certainty of zero" and "raw, untethered beauty" drift slightly elevated for peak emotional beats. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during cipher work, slightly pulled back during the traversal montage). One friction: the final paragraph's syntax ("It was a perfect, lucid contradiction") uses "It was" constructions that dull immediacy when tighter image-driven prose would sharpen voice control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV held cleanly; no head-hopping. The prose has a distinct, cool texture ("cultivated estrangement," "semantic engineer," "delicate architecture") that matches Silas's detachment. Dialogue is sparse but naturalistic ("I think I have the wrong number" / "All numbers connect here, eventually"). Psychic distance is stable. One minor tic: "his tone as flat and functional as the concrete walls" leans slightly into over-articulation, but does not break voice. Perceptual signature is consistent—Silas notices pattern and mechanism, not warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("gentle archaeology of the mundane," "bruised evening"), though some phrases verge on purple ("chemical covenant," "regenerated covenant of love") without quite crossing into opacity. The brief dialogue between Elara and Tomas is purposeful and advances plot, though "his voice thick with emotion" leans toward tell. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices tarnish, paper scent, and chemical reactions—but does not degrade noticeably under the climactic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filters all description through Silas's perspective (moon rock as "lump of the loneliest place," station as monument to apathy). Voice has distinct texture: wry tone ("The Grand Central Malaise," "What's the opposite of a quarantine?"), controlled vocabulary, rhythm that modulates from reflective in early beats to engaged at closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; Silas's final line ("Heard a rumor...") pursues connection without revealing his role. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices hope and hesitation in faces, reads the crowd's potential. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Kaelen's tactile and auditory perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: "skin of his fingertips tingling," "cool whisper against the forest's oppressive hum," and "filtering the overwhelming noise with a lifetime of practice" reflect his blind, sound-sensitive worldview. Diction stays consistent and lyric without register drift ("ghost of a sound," "dialects of dampness and decay"). The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, compressing at the climax ("There. A vibration, thinner than spider silk") and expanding at closure to deliver resonance. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Kaelen's perceptual signature filters setting through professional and emotional bias ("a celestial signal interpreter, a title both grand and modest"). Diction stays consistent—technical precision ("waveform," "byte," "temporal crease") blends with metaphor ("thresh," "chaff and grain") rooted in his agrarian guilt. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during frantic editing, widening slightly at acceptance. Minor: "confidently uncertain" as posture label in paragraph two slightly abstracts rather than fully embodying the contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and close to Elian's perceptual signature: he notices "corroded pylons," "waterlogged bench," "rippling sheet of silver"—details filtered through an artist's eye. Diction is elevated and lyric ("silken thread," "spectral symphony") but consistent throughout, voice-motivated. Lyra's whispers are clearly marked as memory, not head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close during the final gesture ("His hands flew, a desperate, beautiful ballet"). No dialogue appears. The prose texture is distinct and controlled, avoiding filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-limited POV is stable and filtered through Kaelen's analytical-intuitive lens ("his mind...saw what others would miss"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular, though occasional elevated registers ("a necropolis of forgotten knowledge," "a marriage of the analytically intuitive") edge past street-level idiom for a man five years off-grid. No dialogue appears; interiority carries the scene. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the lens-alignment beat, pulling back slightly for the final resolve paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elara's sensory and emotional texture. Perceptual signature is selective: she filters the lab through loss and dream-making. Diction elevates purposefully ("auric lagoon," "metallic flora") without breaking the narrator's lexical plausibility. Brief compression during peak drumming ("soul learning to fly") is voice-motivated. One slip: "a living ghost in a white room, a guinea pig for their experimental cure" in paragraph two reads as external meta-commentary rather than Elara's embodied thought, introducing a tonal seam.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Silas's professional sensibility (identifying walks "the way a sommelier identifies vintages"). Psychic distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches what he can know. Kaelen's dialogue carries distinct arrogance and defeat; Silas's sparse speech reflects his ethos. However, some diction verges on elevated ("testament to quiet competence") in a way that slightly exceeds the focalizer's working register under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Kaelen's perceptions; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and lyric ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "a firefly sighing its last") but remains consistent and legible, fitting a guardian's patient, ritualized stance. No head-hopping. The prose rhythms modulate with pressure: longer, layered sentences during the weaving; shorter, precise beats when the spark is aimed. Perceptual signature is clear—Kaelen notices craft details (shutter slats, angled beam) and emotional resonance (mute despair, cold ache) in ways specific to their role.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. The prose has a deliberate, elevated register—"cobalt library," "amplified quiet," "magnetic grotto"—that fits the speculative-literary tone and Elias's chess-coach interiority. Psychic distance is controlled; his attribute (hearing unspoken words) governs access. Diction occasionally drifts toward the abstract ("unnerving lightness of prophecy," "burgeoning curiosity") but remains within a plausible narrative stance for this POV. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though some constructions ("a low hum of anxiety," "forests of second thoughts") feel slightly writerly rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV holds steady on Kaelen with no head-hopping; Elara's interiority is accessed only through the scrimshaw's effect and visible behavior. Diction is elevated and controlled ("fluid economy of motion," "sublittoral fringe"), fitting the lyric-mythic register. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is Kaelen's: ocean-gray eyes, restless water-gazing. Minor: "soul-shaking thrum" and "primeval blossoms" edge toward purple without full embodiment in Kaelen's prior lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited with tight focalization through Elias; perceptual signature is character-specific (turbines as heartbeat, dust motes as audience). The theatrical narration is distinct from the silent whittling, and the final line's flat delivery ("The songbird has found its silent grove") shifts tone to mark closure. No dialogue, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from performed grandiosity to stripped sincerity. Minor: "worthy of the coming ritual" and "sacred sachet" edge toward self-conscious diction, but the effect is voice-motivated and legible as Elias's deliberate performance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with Kael's aesthetic sensibility shaping every perception ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," "geological time and starlight"). Diction remains elevated and character-specific without unmotivated register shifts, and the prose reflects his trained attention to beauty and structure. The free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully as Kael moves from observer to participant. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, though some phrasing ("letting the lantern-moth hush of the atrium settle over him") leans slightly ornamental without loss of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV through Elian is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: his colorblind vision, focus on "textures and tones," and pattern-reading. Distance modulates appropriately—closer during his cunning insight, wider when surveying the courtyard. Vex's brief dialogue ("It's impossible") and Lyra's weak "Mother?" feel natural. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("profound and unadorned beauty," "certainty that settled deep in his bones") that slightly exceeds Elian's established idiom under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elian's perspective controlled throughout. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("reverence usually reserved for tombs," "silent canyons of archived data") that fits the quasi-mystical premise. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("deep need to discover the texture of connection") without grounding in Elian's specific lexicon. The phrase "powerfully gentle strength" is told rather than enacted until the apparatus work. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elias with clean distance control. Voice carries a distinct lyric register: "withering to bloom," "curtains of intention," "fire in his forge." Perceptual signature is consistent—grief-smithing metaphor, jeweler's precision in description. The woman's single line of dialogue ("My brother...He loved the stars") feels natural and advances understanding. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he watched") are frequent but voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Diction remains elevated but character-appropriate for a craftsman in a timeless sanctuary. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Elara is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close when filtering the cards' "elegant, severe lines" and her father's worn tape, pulling back slightly for Julian's arrival. Narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge; her theories are presented as belief, not fact. Diction is elevated but consistent with an intellectual observer: "cartomancy," "reverse engineering," "amplified by new channels." Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—Julian's "I just needed to understand" and Elara's "Belief isn't a single event" both pursue goals (his: comprehension; hers: teaching) without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices "onyx-ink designs," "bruised twilight," "anatomy of his own ruin laid bare"—a mind that sees systems and patterns. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "a profound weight settled in the room" tells rather than shows the shift, but the surrounding interiority recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (scholar's analytical gaze layered with wonder). Diction is elevated and matches the archival setting, though some phrases veer toward stock fantasy register ("profound silence," "tomb of wonders"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") cluster in the sensory-flood paragraph but serve the accumulative design. No head-hopping. The prose maintains distinct texture through the ritual's mounting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Kael; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature is consistent: "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" filters detail through archival and emotional lenses. Diction is elevated and purposeful, though phrases like "abiding sorrow" and "luminous regret" approach abstraction. The whispered dialogue ("It's alright, Elara. I'm not letting you fall.") is brief, goal-driven, and voice-consistent. Free indirect style is clean. The narrative voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity (the urgency of "devouring the rest of her" versus the quiet of the final paragraph). Minor penalty for slightly abstract register in peak moments that edges toward committee voice rather than Kael's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays clean, diction is controlled ("coiled," "shimmering stillness," "quietly vivid"), and perceptual signature is consistent—wildlife handler's focus on scale, color, body language. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on the fitting, wider on the final reflection). No head-hopping. One minor slip: "the very source of his skill and his purpose" leans slightly expository but remains anchored in the on-page action. Rhythm varies under pressure (short sentences during the fitting, longer during reflection).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elias's perceptual signature intact: he feels scars as "returning geography," senses ivy's "green pulse," and uses a divination method particular to his obsession. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tunneling, wider at ritual setup). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("meteor hush," "psychic soil and rock," "archivist"). No head-hopping. The ivy's memory bleeds at the edge of his concentration without violating focalization—it's his accidental telepathy, not omniscience. Minor density: some phrases trend slightly elevated ("codified," "psychic soil") but remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elara's perceptual signature: "fractured time," "frequency of absence," "phantom elbows." Diction is elevated and controlled, matching the lyric-accumulative mode. Free indirect style is clean during Arthur's embedded vision. Some filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear under stress but remain voice-motivated. Occasional reach toward poetic register—"silence was a specific frequency of absence," "hushed thunder promising revelation or collapse"—borders on overwriting but stays coherent. No head-hopping, tense is stable, and the prose texture reflects Elara's contemplative stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully from the opening's expository setup to close focus during the tracing ritual and epiphany. Voice is distinct and lyric—"sky bled green and violet," "soul-scribe," "shadowed rapture"—with elevated diction ("plainsong," "incandescent arc," "ancestral echo") that matches the cosmic subject and Elara's reflective isolation. Perceptual signature is consistent: she hears unspoken words as "static," perceives meteors as "pure, clean thought," and filters the world through her psychic burden. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the meteor moment. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") are voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy. Minor: "attribute of the soul" and "affliction" in the opening lean slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV distance is stable, psychic reach controlled ("Kaelen's awareness spread thin" cued by the conduit method). Diction is voice-particular: "ghost of history," "fractured lullaby," "perilously, wonderfully" all cohere in a lyric-technical register. Purposeful compression in "occasionally everywhere" is taught through repeated embodiment and paid off at closure. No dialogue to judge. Minor tic: "the method was elegant in its complexity" tells rather than trusts the wave-function weaving to show elegance, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, literary, and carries a distinct perceptual signature: the philosopher's attention to acoustics, pattern, and logic. Diction remains elevated but controlled, avoiding unmotivated register shifts. The POV is stable third-limited with clear psychic distance. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward expository interiority—"He wanted to unravel the connection," "he thought, was the nexus"—that tells the reader the protagonist's goals rather than letting choice and perception imply them. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the climactic passage ("The noise of the world faded away...") summarizes the revelation rather than dramatizing perception under pressure. No dialogue appears; the story is a solo interior journey, appropriately sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is concrete: "purple ink bleeding," "firefly light," "sea-worn stones." Narrative certainty matches what Elara can know; the guides' inner states remain opaque. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("The path is open now" implies inevitability without exposition). Diction ("gloaming," "promontory," "jasmine") fits the lyric register without slipping into purple excess. One small tension: "had the feeling of an appointment kept" slightly tells rather than shows, but the effect is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and aptly close; perceptual signature is distinct (singer's ear for "muffled percussion," professional bellhop's "seraphically mundane" movements). Diction is controlled and character-particular without register drift. The narrative withholds nothing Elias knows; the backstory anchor (Agnus Dei collapse) is cued by the stair-stain and primes the present choice. No dialogue appears on the page; the piece uses silence and gesture as primary modes. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the bolt-placement beat, and prose rhythm reflects Elias's state: deliberate, penitential cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance consistent throughout. Diction is elevated but coherent: "regally unpretentious," "phantom river," "un-creator." Perceptual signature reflects Kael's professional focus (annotations, symbols, light). However, register occasionally drifts into expository summary ("His war was not one of armies but of whispers") and the narration withholds the pellet's existence until retrieval despite Kael knowing his plan. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully but leans ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited POV remains stable; Aris's perceptual signature filters setting through scientific observation and grief ("skeletal monument," "desolate boneyard"). Diction stays consistent—technical yet elegiac, no head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the tapping sequence and discovery beat. Purposeful compression in the weeks-long monitoring loop conveys accumulation without dragging. Minor slip: "A detail he had overlooked for years swam into focus" leans slightly expository when showing the spiral would suffice, but voice recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited focused through Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices scorch marks as "dark sun-rays," feels stone as "frozen lightning," and frames the uprising in acoustic metaphors. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout: "graveyard of the Uprising," "thunderous serenity," "constellation of ghosts." The prose modulates with pressure—short, focused syntax during the hum sequence. Psychic distance shifts intentionally from external observation to embodied sensation as she kneels and begins the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout; Elara's perceptual signature—plant communion rendered as "silent green-and-red consciousness," "pure sensation"—is distinct and purposeful. Diction is elevated but consistent ("coiling around her weathered hands like ghosts of the old world," "nascent destiny held in stasis"), with no unmotivated register shifts. The final paragraph drifts toward summary-voice ("she had planted a seed that would grow in the cracks") rather than maintaining sensory immediacy, and some filter verbs ("felt a silent hum," "seemed to pulse") dull close-focus moments, but voice coheres under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and controlled; diction reflects Anya's professional and traumatic filters ("somatic markers," "geology, not technology"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices growth patterns, soil, resin. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during panic, pulling back slightly at the end. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("She could not look") are voice-motivated and serve the panic sequence. The compression "It meant nothing. It meant everything" is purposeful and earns its contradiction through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and distinct perceptual signature—an artist's eye that sees "constellation of disconnected features" and transforms box splinters into islands. Purposeful compression in the work sequence ("hours…metronome…fragments became islands") fits the Accumulative design. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mocking familiarity," "luminescent ache") that slightly exceeds a man in crisis, but the texture remains consistent and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and maintained: elevated diction consistent with Kael's role as tracker of impossible things ("viscous midnight," "fractal lattices," "quantum thread"). POV distance is stable third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature reflects his professional lens (reading "impossible geometry," tracker's mind trained to see paths). Purposeful compression in the final beat ("He was elsewhere…between") serves the mystery without obscuring the transition. No dialogue present; all pressure conveyed through narration and embodied action. The phrase "consciously wild" is used twice in different contexts without becoming a tic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable throughout with consistent third-limited distance. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("data-fane," "cryo-pumps," "automaton's purpose") that fits a scholarly archivist's perception. Elara's perceptual signature—noticing "frost-rimmed data-vaults," "ghost in the machine"—is selective and coherent. However, phrases like "bravely conflicted" and "schism running through the core" tilt toward abstract psychology rather than voice-specific idiom. The narrative occasionally tells what has been shown ("Her motivation was not destruction..."), slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature filters all detail through her gift and values (roots' "tremor of anxiety," plants' "whisper of thirst"). Diction remains consistent: elevated but character-apt ("senselessly perceptive," "profound negation"). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, textured sentences in the opening calm, shorter syntax at the knife moment ("The desert outside was vast and hungry"), then a controlled exhale in the sheathing beat. One minor slip: "engraved quiet" appears twice in similar phrasing without reprise charge.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is distinct—sound structures are "felt" as emotional textures, and Kaelen's calm functions as tactical insulation. The diction ("somnambulist's waltz," "deluge of abandonment") is elevated and consistent, though occasionally it drifts into generic poetic register ("his soul alight") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the climax when Kaelen "ceased to be a man," though the shift lacks embodied stakes. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The narrative certainty remains appropriate to Kaelen's knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in third-limited, with Celeste's perceptual signature (the flinch at rain, April on a calendar, "solemn playfulness") establishing voice. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, each line pursuing persuasion or revelation. However, the journalist Davies is a flat receiver with no distinct idiom—his stammered responses could belong to anyone. The prose modulates effectively from solemn reflection to tactical argument, but at peak pressure the diction elevates ("neat, damning story," "cascade of failures") rather than compressing into Celeste's lived urgency. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    The POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; perceptual signature is consistent (stars as pathways, circuits as star-charts). Diction stays within his idiom: "whisper against skin," "sonic ghosts," "tether this echo." The firmware's translated text (*Cold. Scared. Where is Papa?*) introduces a second voice that functions as Lyra's ghost rather than breaking focalization. Brief elevated phrasing ("profound quiet that follows a cataclysm," "sonic ghosts") fits the lyric register but nudges toward the ornate in a few beats without crossing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: she reads body language like text ("the slump of a shoulder like a paragraph of loss") and filters the grotto through her artist's sensibility. Diction remains stable in third-person limited with purposeful elevated register ("axioms dissolved," "entropic quiet") that fits a poetic consciousness. However, phrases like "the unlearning, a slow societal fever dream" and "lilac unease" edge toward authorial abstraction rather than character-particular perception, creating minor distance slippage in peak reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering through Kaelen's perception with phrases like "warm coldness" and "ghost's departure." The dialogue is minimal but purposeful: "Who are you?" and "My name is Ren" feel natural and advance the plot. Diction remains consistent—no head-hopping or register drift. However, filter verbs ("He believed," "He was not a healer; he was an editor") and slightly elevated constructions ("his voice a study in warm coldness") create psychic distance at key beats where immediacy would heighten pressure. The prose voice is distinct but occasionally leans explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited with stable distance, anchored tightly in Julian's perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors ("sour note, the color of rust," "cider-sparkle echoes") create a distinct, character-particular voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms close for Julian's effort, steps back for Elara's physical response). No head-hopping; Elara's interiority is accessed only through external observation. One minor register slip: "His very essence a low hum of rising nostalgia" reads slightly elevated for a ghost actor, but it's brief and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; prose rhythm accelerates through the layered echo sequence, then breathes into the quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: "affectionate skeptic," the framing of Lena's belief as both loved and doubted. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("Ready?" / "Always."). The phrase "willowglass hope" in the penultimate paragraph risks register drift—"willowglass" reads neologistic and slightly precious for Elias's established voice—but the surrounding concrete detail (geode, pulse) keeps the passage grounded. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the experiments and opening slightly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: professional vocabulary (heat-mapping, sensor whir, null-space), selective sensory focus (color bands, mineral tang, resonant frequency). The prose modulates appropriately—technical precision early, lyric expansion during the merger ("slow, tectonic joy of formation"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "It was a consciousness, not a memory" edges toward narrator certainty beyond what Elara could verify in the moment, though it reads as her interpretation. Diction remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Kaelen's scholarly perspective. Diction suits the character: "monastic," "painstaking," "iridescence muted by dust," "heartbreaking stories of choice and consequence." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during cataloging, wider at the threshold moment. One voice wobble: "A chaotic cascade of whispers flooded the silence" and later "The prophecy wasn't a period at the end of a sentence; it was a comma" shift into elevated, meta-commentary register that feels authorial rather than Kaelen's in-the-moment thought. The single line of dialogue ("From a weaver's christening gown") anchors his method but remains brief; no multi-character voice test applies. Perceptual signature is consistent—scholarly precision, tactile attention to buttons, historical inference.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; focalization is controlled and perceptual signature is present (e.g., watching Kestrel in the pillbox's reflection, deciphering codes). Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext ("You offered a way to fix what's broken"). The prose voice is distinct—elevated diction consistent with a spy's trained eye—and psychic distance tightens under pressure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor: "a ghost in the silver hush" and "the weight of secrets" lean slightly toward stock phrases, but the overall texture is controlled and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature ("ambient awareness," "settled absorption") reflects Elias's professional method throughout. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("spindrift serenity," "slow-boiling tar"), with no register drift. The palimpsest passage risks slight over-articulation ("First came the layer...Then came...Finally") but stays within the narrator's reflective idiom and serves the accumulative pressure. No dialogue appears; interior voice is coherent and purpose-driven. Rhythm modulates effectively: longer reflective sentences during memory, shorter declaratives at closure ("The fog had not lifted, but a path was clear").

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature rooted in Kaelen's craft: "potter's intuition," "clay having a memory of the wheel," earth worked "not into a vessel, but back into its purpose." Diction stays character-consistent—"quiet deliberation of water finding its level" fits his zen-minded framing without slipping into therapy-speak. The prose modulates appropriately from observation to urgency ("forgetting food, forgetting the coming night"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in Elara's perceptual signature: gardener's patience, inherited pragmatism, sensory attention to salt air and city hum. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("wistfully pragmatic sigh," "metal bloom"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider city-breath. Purposeful compression in the nightly ritual ("Night after night") serves accumulative pressure without losing clarity. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Kael's perceptual signature throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("menagerie of impossible life," "placid weight"), matching a solitary scholar's interior voice. The prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic control that modulates from brittle fragmentation ("shards, brittle things") to the anchored calm of the ending. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance stays intimate, and the narrative certainty never exceeds what Kael can know.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature (professional keeper of secrets, attention to small wild architecture, longing). Diction is elevated and consistent, though some phrases ("a library of longing," "constellation of human hearts") veer toward lyric generality rather than her specific idiom. Psychic distance contracts appropriately at the decision moment. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices astronomical charts as "anchors," the community's schism as "invisible lines," and her weapon as "a hum, an imperceptible vibration." The prose modulates with pressure ("her heart hammering against her ribs" as she watches the quad). Register is consistent (scientific idiom filtered through her mindset: "neuro-acoustic level," "subsonic frequencies"). No dialogue appears. Distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches her knowledge, and the tricksters' arrogance is presented as her inference, not omniscient fact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias, with perceptual signature clear (claustrophobic dread colors every spatial observation, "cold reminder of the stone"). Diction modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during panic, dense figurative language ("infinite, dark throat") at peak stress. The phrase "wistful rebellion" in the opening paragraph reads slightly authorial rather than Elias's idiom, and "profound spatial mutiny" recurs as an elevated descriptor that feels imposed rather than emerging from his vocabulary under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction ("the world had been violently scooped out," "frayed fragment...its silk the color of a fading bruise") and controlled psychic distance throughout. POV remains stable in tight third with Elias's perceptual filter clear. However, register occasionally drifts into writerly observation that exceeds character filter ("a whisper of celebration before the silence," "the shape of their end"). The prose rhythms support contemplative mood but show mechanical parallelism in paired opposites that begins to feel patterned rather than organic by the third iteration.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close; Elias's perceptual signature (idealism, family-legend fixation, nervous confidence) filters all description. Diction is controlled and distinct: "spongey dread," "salt-tongue licks the stone," "clean, bright fire of confidence." No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decoding, slightly wider during backstory). Minor issue: some figurative language ("breathing entity in the swirling fog," "the clean, bright fire of confidence") veers toward stock metaphor under peak pressure, but voice remains coherent overall.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV with a distinct lyric register: "dynamically observant," "luminous disbelief," "question mark of impossible hope." Distance and focalization remain stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with a musician-narrator filtering perception through metaphor. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (breathless laugh, tentative bow-draw). Lyra's brief dialogue feels poetic and goal-driven. Minor slip: "recount it, to spin the memory" in paragraph two uses filter verbs that slightly dull immediacy, though the effect is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with strong perceptual signature: "his gaze steady," "soft as dust motes in a sunbeam," filtering detail through Elias's calm and his father's shadow. The CEO's dialogue is purposeful and distinct. Minor wobble: "the casual cruelty of a poker bet" and "the predatory smile of a different kind of robber" edge toward authorial commentary rather than strict focalization, but the intrusion is brief and doesn't obscure the lens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, and narrative distance modulates purposefully (close during the dream, slightly wider at dawn). Diction reflects Elian's scholarly sensibility ("lucid dream chronicler," "ideograms," "motes of light") without jarring register shifts. Perceptual signature is clear: he filters the cosmos through textual metaphors (stars as verbs and adjectives). Two minor slips: "surrendering to the practiced descent" and "profound and enveloping calm" lean toward stock phrasing under emotional peaks. Free indirect style is clean, and the final paragraph's rhythm supports the closure image. No dialogue present; interior voice is consistent but occasionally smooths complexity with generic wellness language ("fractured narratives," "healing").

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature is consistent (druidic idiom, sympathetic excavation metaphor). Distance modulates purposefully during the vortex breach ("the world screamed in her mind"). Register occasionally elevates beyond strict POV plausibility ("sympathetic excavation," "nexus of the failed trick") but remains voice-motivated within a trained druid's lexicon. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. The final beat's rhythm supports the emotional release without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled psychic distance. Voice is distinct: "sap-slowed blood," "landscapes to be explored," "a razor's edge" carry a specific texture. Perceptual signature is selective—she notices scars, traceries, and the clipping's waxy leaves—filtered through her immobile, visionary stance. Purposeful compression in "A wave of vertigo" and "the boundary...grew thin, permeable" is taught and legible. No head-hopping. Minor deduction: "the obsession that sang in her sap-slowed blood" and "frantic pinprick of light lost in a storm of nightmare static" edge toward elevated diction that, while voice-motivated, slightly strains naturalism under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited on Aris; perceptual signature is distinct ("phantom joy that now belonged to no one"). Diction stays character-bound (soil and sorrow, dusky resolve). The one dialogue line ("Take this...") is goal-driven and carries subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to observed action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: "he saw Jez, high and incandescent, kick the speaker stack" carries the roadie's technical eye. Diction remains within character range throughout, mixing technical precision ("Mid-90s Marshall, salt-and-pepper basketweave") with figurative compression ("fortress of facts," "shipwreck"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close during the memory flood ("He smelled the ozone crackle") and pulling back for the final reflection. The phrase "confidently uncertain" and "geography of his own heart" edge toward elevated register but remain voice-plausible for an antiques appraiser with literary tendencies. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elara's perceptions throughout. Diction is mostly character-particular—"cuneiform," "analogical thinking," "syntax of how a presence so absolute could become an absence"—reflecting her translator's mindset. Voice modulates with emotional intensity: the opening's heavy sorrow lightens to anticipation by the end. Two slips lower the score: "the physics of transition itself" and "complex waveform... phase transition" read slightly elevated for someone in active grief, edging toward authorial register rather than embodied thought; and "her ambition was no longer haunted; it was illuminated" tells the thematic shift rather than trusting the final image to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Kaelan's titan-gear perception: optical sensors cataloging patterns, "immense weight," multi-jointed brass fingers. Diction ("migration of selfhood," "empathetic heat," "wintersun serenity") balances elevated register with concrete sensory anchors without head-hopping. Psychic distance shifts purposefully as personas migrate. One minor slip: "a school of perfect, gleaming smelt" in the final turn introduces the fish pun late without prior setup, creating a micro tonal jar that doesn't break voice but nudges the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and poetic ("eulogy for a world that had held its breath too long," "thick as honey") and remains internally coherent. One register slip: "psychological measure to ease the transition into permanent lockdown" shifts into clinical exposition mid-discovery. The perceptual signature is selective—Elias notices warmth, etchings, resonance—but does not vary under peak stress; the climactic beat maintains the same lyric register without compression or syntactic tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Elias's raw, un-numbed perception. Diction is controlled and particular: "nadir of his chart," "broken lung," "desperate logic of the un-numbed." The accordion passage modulates beautifully—"wheezing note...profound exhaustion...breath in and breath out"—matching his emotional arc without over-articulation. Minor slip: "daringly methodical" in paragraph two reads like external characterization rather than embodied choice, briefly pulling distance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization with a distinct elevated register ("gossamer fabric," "cathedral of his regret," "haptic tremor") that fits the dreamlike, lyric mode. However, diction under pressure—"cautious exuberance that was almost painful," "trembling," "desperate"—leans on label-only emotion rather than embodied perception, and filter verbs ("felt like") appear at key beats without being strictly voice-motivated. The perceptual signature (light-motes as syllables, propagation delays as reading method) is specific and sustained, but the uniform lyricism across all beats, including high-pressure moments, flattens the rhythm and reduces the sense of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective and character-biased (provenance researcher's eye, morning coffee ritual, secret plant-telepathy). Diction is controlled and distinct ("mulberry ache," "velvet cage," "glowing promise"). Minor slip: "the bittersweet sorrow of a man who polishes thrones for a living" reads slightly elevated for his internal voice, and "the unbearable weight of his motivation: to weigh a dream..." edges into theme-echo phrasing. Psychic distance is appropriate; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature ("lucidly watchful," synesthetic vibrations, phantom heartbeats) that is character-particular. Diction elevates appropriately for the fantastical setting without slipping into therapy-speak or corporate register. Psychic distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches what Elara can know. Minor slip: "a process she had completed in a place where time held no meaning" intrudes meta-commentary mid-action, but the voice recovers immediately and the ending's rhythmic control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with clean focalization on Elara's perceptions. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent ("vineyard hush," "scallop the soil," "pearlescent light"). The perceptual signature is selective: Elara notices luminous water, decay feeding life, the obsidian hairpin's cool weight. However, register drift appears in peak beats: "the quiet resonance of taking part" and "a seed seeking light" read as slightly abstract and over-polished for mid-crisis thought. Under stress, the syntax remains uniformly lyric rather than compressing, which dilutes urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV distance is stable first-person with controlled perceptual signature: "calibrated to be both soothing and distant," "sincerely insincere," "my trade secret." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from detached observer to intimate guide. The narrator's professional idiom ("protected vulnerability," "abstract commodity I sold") remains consistent without register drift. Kaelen's sparse dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("They say you offer clarity"). Minor slip: "his voice raspy from a night of confession and cheap whiskey" is told exposition rather than shown through cadence or word choice in his speech.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Kael; Elara's interiority is accessed only through observable cues (smile, voice, eyes). Diction is elevated and lyric—"sycamore hush," "shrill note," "moss-soft voice"—which fits the meditative tone but occasionally drifts into register ornament ("anomaly personified," "history her face had yet to live"). Dialogue carries subtext: Elara's aphorisms ("You cannot rush the tide") guide without explaining, and Kael's tight retorts reveal impatience. Filter verbs ("seemed to come from") and some abstract phrasing ("the trance began with the soundless splash") slightly dull immediacy at peak beats, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited with tight focalization through Kaelan's perceptual signature (acoustic attention, reverent patience, harmonic sensing). Narrative distance is stable and voice modulates purposefully: longer, lyric cadences during waiting ("Through centuries of layered dust, Kaelan had sat, listening") compress to sharper syntax at the climactic hum. No head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("pulse left wandering," "ache in the air without a body to house it"). One filter-verb cluster in the flock-reading paragraph ("saw the story... showed the beast turning") slightly dulls immediacy under peak pressure but does not obscure clarity. Psychic distance deepens appropriately during the harmonic gesture. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Voice is consistent: "poet forced to write legal code," "baggage he carried," "unenthusiastic motions" all carry his weary, misaligned stance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax (bare palm, flare, resonance). Diction stays character-appropriate until the final paragraph, where "the most powerful magic of all" shifts into a slightly elevated, tell-oriented register that weakens the established texture. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present but the ending's phrasing feels slightly external.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-close on Silas; perceptual signature (scientific checklist as defense, sensory detail filtered through grief) is consistent and character-specific. Diction modulates aptly from factual (gauges, seals, rebreather) to lyric ("meteor hush," "liquid night") without jarring breaks. Two minor register slips: "the terrifying enormity of his task" and "an answer, soft and certain as a held breath" tilt slightly abstract for peak moments. No dialogue; interior voice is distinct and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and diction that fits a solitary scholar: "esoteric," "phantom signals," "stellar doubt." No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "believed") are sparse and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is selective (ridged ducat edge, hexagonal sovereign heft). Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during coin-draw, longer during reflection. The backwards-prophecy text in quotation marks reads slightly elevated but remains plausible as archived religious/philosophical artifact. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all perception through Kael's grief-saturated attention. Narrative distance modulates appropriately: tighter at the crystallization climax, slightly more expansive during the opening setup. Diction occasionally elevates ("the vast and monstrous geography of his own sorrow," "magnificent, terrifying sea monsters inked in faded gold and indigo") in ways that feel slightly ornamental rather than strictly character-bound for a millennia-old reaper, though the poetic register remains consistent. Perceptual signature is clear: Kael notices light, sound, memory-objects, and the physical traces of absence. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization through Kael's perception and value hierarchy (dripping rates, harmonic intervals). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("lukewarm mage," "plausible impossibility," "brittle devotion"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the adjustment, pulling back for the final image of the darkened dust. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor density in figurative language ("elegy for a world," "pilot light") fits the lyric register without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance. Voice is controlled and textured: "the drought's severity in feet and inches" vs. "measured in ghosts"; "a quiet obsession"; "his voice as calm and steady as the ridgeway itself." Perceptual signature: professional measurement vs. emotional weight. No head-hopping. Diction stays in register (warden, clerk, archive) without sudden elevation. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (photograph, label, logbook) and tilts stance via micro-choices (continuing the search, signing the correction). No filter-verb stacks or voice convergence. Strong control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third limited, consistent distance. Diction is elevated and character-specific ("crystalline, logical clarity," "sublime choir," "ancient, sacred space"), matching Elias's alchemical identity. The perceptual signature—noticing vectors, equations, reagents—is distinct. However, under peak stress (the starling observation), the prose remains decorative rather than compressing into sharper syntax. No head-hopping or filter abuse. The locket reveal and sublimation beats are clean, though "touch of wonder" and "flowing grace" edge toward abstract vocabulary slightly outside immediate embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (technical awareness filtered through urgency: "hair-thin ring of spun crystal," "whining in a new, higher pitch"). Diction remains within Kael's lexicon. Under peak stress, the prose compresses appropriately ("Click, pull, check"). Minor deduction: occasional filter-verb stacks ("had been," "had charted") slightly dull immediacy in the opening, though they don't obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dust motes," "temporal static," "phantom limb of an emotion") but trends toward a uniform literary register that flattens under peak pressure rather than sharpening. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Jin's lines carry goal (stop the act) but minimal subtext. The perceptual signature—Kael's detached observation, honed by numbness—is present but not deeply particular. Free indirect style is clean. The prose remains legible and controlled but does not achieve a distinct rhythmic signature or voice modulation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on the ghost with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is specific—he filters through love and mechanical memory ("a conduit for his particular brand of noisy care"). Diction remains apt ("spectral fingers, more memory than matter") without register drift. The wife's interiority in the final paragraphs (fear to curiosity to recognition) is cleanly external until the tear moment, where free indirect briefly deepens without breaking POV. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure (short fragments at the engine's catch). Minor template cadence in "He gathered… He poured…" slightly flattens momentum mid-climb.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is single, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "feral thing of sharp senses," "boundaries of light were a frayed and uncertain suggestion." Diction modulates under pressure—short, clipped sentences when the portal opens—without losing coherence. Lyric compression ("dimensionally homesick," "interiorizing exteriors") is purposeful and legible. Minor slip: "make friends with uncertainty" in paragraph four slightly breaks register, reading more like prompt echo than Lyel's interior idiom; the phrase is conceptual rather than embodied in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated-lyric with a fantasy register: "twilight bled purple," "dissolving syllables," "silent, weightless stream." POV distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear in Elias's focus on alchemical process and emotional sting. However, "when the penny drops" is a modern colloquialism that clashes with the established diction; it reads like an unfiltered prompt cue. The phrase "his stoic mask finally cracking into an expression of raw, silent awe" is generic rather than idiosyncratically Elias. Syntax is varied and purposeful; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("serenely electric," "cosmic dust," "ghost-whispers"). Diction remains within Elara's technical-mystical lexicon. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decision beats, slightly wider for setting). Minor dip: "a constant, lonely note" and "swollen pearl" read slightly stock, and "un-ask the old question" as direct mentor echo feels convenient rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Finn's perceptual signature (observing interconnected patterns) is consistent and character-specific. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure. Captain Eva's single line of dialogue feels natural and carries subtext (memory "papered over"). The narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("temporal eddy," "resonant reconfiguration") that sits at the edge of Finn's plausible lexicon as a deckhand, though it coheres with the cosmic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "fever dream architect," details filtered through craft obsession ("realistically imaginary," "formula," "equation made manifest"). Diction elevates intentionally ("moire patterns," "tectonic plate," "consensus") matching the character's conceptual frame. Some filter verbs ("felt he was on the verge") slightly dull immediacy. Psychic distance is stable. The phrase "realistically imaginary" recurs without becoming tic. Voice remains distinct and purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable throughout; Kaelen's professional lens (navigation instructor, edge-geometry practitioner) shapes perception and diction consistently. Voice is controlled and apt, with a measured, contemplative register ("balancedly curious nature," "potential pathway"). The council dialogue is brief but functional, serving plot advancement rather than deep subtext. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—quiet determination in research, measured conviction in the council scene—without rupture. Perceptual signature is specific to Kaelen's nautical/spatial expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Elias. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("cartography of loss," "technician of sorrow," "reeling hush"), establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Leo's line feels natural. However, some phrasing ("eighty-seven years before she was gone entirely," "shepherd toward calm") tilts into elevated abstraction that stands slightly outside Elias's lived technical role. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature: Elias sees distortions as "heat-shimmer," tastes "ozone and granite." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during panic, slightly pulled back for the grandmother memory). Diction remains controlled under pressure—"nauseating, colorless vibration" captures phase-state confusion. Minor slip: the shift from first-person framing ("my grandmother") to third-person Elias creates a brief distance inconsistency in the second paragraph, though it stabilizes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with distinct perceptual texture: Elara's attention filters through her heartbeat rhythm and the defragmentation task. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, balancing lyric elevation ("viscous, starless-night ink") with concrete action. The pulse-counting refrain ("One, two, three") provides rhythmic anchoring without becoming mechanical. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the ink-manipulation sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "epiphany that resonated with the very core of her being" leans slightly authorial in a peak beat, though the surrounding particulars anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is distinct and controlled: sensory signature tied to copper-veined skin, poetic compression ("a river of black ink flowing through the air"), and diction that stays within Kaelen's reflective, texture-focused register. POV distance is stable; filter verbs and free-indirect style are clean. The perceptual signature—feeling texture as language—is character-specific and consistent under pressure. No dialogue is present; interiority remains embodied ("My copper-veined hands, usually steady, trembled"). The final lines sustain the established voice without drift, and the piece teaches its lyric cadence early, maintaining clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: Julian's investigator bias ("herbalist's boy," "expose the monster") colors early descriptions, then shifts under pressure to acceptance. Voice modulates from bitter certainty ("my bitterness had craved a simple villain") to humbled realization ("cosmically stupid") with diction that remains character-specific throughout. Psychic distance tightens during the transformation scene with sensory immediacy ("bone-white knuckles," "wax near a flame") and no head-hopping. Brief filter verbs ("I felt," "I thought") are voice-motivated and don't dull the pressure. The closing rhythm—short declarative refusals followed by the frostbitten-hope pivot—controls the final beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is mostly controlled and voice-specific ("gossamer sky-bridge," "tarnished wonder," "frantic flutter"), though phrases like "methodical march became a charge" and "blanket of moss and nascent flowers" drift toward generic lyricism. The narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge except for "She knew what she had to do," which asserts rather than dramatizes insight. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on sound, pulse, and color. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct—lyric, slightly elevated diction ("a second skin of grit and compromise," "an artform of negatives") that fits a solitary, philosophical protagonist performing sacramental work. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices time (luminous dial, countdown), absences (gaps, blind spots), and sensory markers of the border's hum. The prose modulates well under pressure—short, clipped sentences during the countdown ("Three. Two. One.") contrast with the reflective opening. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are sparse. Minor: phrases like "a prayer sent not to a god, but through a loophole" and "the weight of a duty fulfilled" approach summary-telling in peak beats, though they remain voice-coherent and do not obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: Elias notices through his hands, tools, and the textures of decay. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("misting hush," "quietly persistent argument," "whispering gleam"). Free indirect style is clean. However, several phrases drift into elevated or abstract register that feels authorial rather than character-grounded: "a piece of a forgotten sky fallen into a forgotten world," "a feeling too vast for his chest, too powerful for his silent throat," and "a space made sacred by a sound" read as narrator commentary rather than Elias's way of noticing under pressure. These slips reduce psychic distance control in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; psychic distance stays controlled, with narration reflecting Elias's perceptual filter ("a man of sanely eccentric habits," "impossible curves"). Diction is elevated but consistent with the librarian's scholarly idiom ("topological anomaly," "geodesic path"). No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: measured in setup, then compressing during the ritual ("thrum," "shimmer"), breathing out in closure. Filter verbs appear sparingly and feel voice-motivated. The perceptual signature—geometry, memory, pattern—is character-specific and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, with Silas's perceptual signature evident in "cipher of longing," "pearlescent glow," "luminous absence." Diction stays consistent: elevated but grounded in sensory craft (glass plate, spring water, candle). Psychic distance tightens at key beats ("His heart hammered," "hands trembled") without head-hopping. No dialogue; interiority is filtered through ritual and observation. One minor register drift: "emanating the precise feeling" reads slightly clinical for peak emotional closure, but the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains elevated, mythic register throughout ("ley lines of memory and starlight," "velvet curtain of twilight") with consistent diction and rhythm. The woman's single line of dialogue ("The music is still in there") feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext of grief and hope. Psychic distance remains stable in tight third around the Locksmith, though the prose occasionally drifts toward narrator-knows-all certainty ("It was not a message of words, but of pattern and resonance") that exceeds what the focalizer can demonstrate. No head-hopping, but the mythic register risks distancing the reader from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: "celestial cipher only he had learned to read," the technical vocabulary of pressure gauges and mechanical arms filtered through a folklorist's sensibility. Diction elevates purposefully ("cathedral of glass," "jagged corona") without violating character knowledge. Rhythm modulates effectively from the measured opening observation to the trembling climax. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single tight third-person on Elara with stable distance and no head-hopping. Kael's dialogue carries his combative register ("Are you going to stare, or are you going to learn?") distinct from Elara's tentative voice. Perceptual signature is consistent: she watches, flinches, feels small, then finds strength. The phrasing "fractured gaze seeming to multiply her in his eyes" and "quiet roar of his belief" are vivid but edge toward slight overwriting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to Elara's realization at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated register: "verdant parapet," "radiant hush," "ravenous thirst," which coheres across beats and fits a guardian trained in whispered techniques. Psychic distance is controlled; Elian's perceptions anchor all sensory input. Minor deduction: diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("impossible beauty," "profound peace") that could fit any mystical narrative, and the phrase "giving the seed a soul" reads as authorial summary rather than Elian's idiom. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV, first-person focalization is stable and controlled. Voice is distinct: "a thin thread," "interlaced hush," "un-weaving the path of the rope" carry a formal, meditative texture consistent with the restorer's craft. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and differentiated by register (narrator's instruction vs. Kaelen's surprise). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ritual ("I focused, my breath held"). Minor slip: "the secret we now shared settling between us like a shroud" slightly over-explains what the scene has already shown. Perceptual signature is character-specific (noticing the needle's "sliver of starlight," the knot's "minuscule opening").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—focused but receptive, attuned to fragile histories—colors the narration throughout. Distance is stable, and the final moments shift psychic distance purposefully as she moves from discovery to annotation. Minor register drift appears in elevated phrasing ("empathetic rush that breached her careful shields," "the silence screamed") that sits slightly above a working conservator's internal voice under stress, though it does not break the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinctive: formal, precise, melancholic, with a perceptual signature that favors architectural and physical detail filtered through professional detachment. POV remains stable; the address to "Mortimer" maintains internal consistency as a coping mechanism rather than true dialogue. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though occasional elevated phrasing ("abyssal dark," "esoteric") leans academic. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: the phrase "physics of letting go" recurs with slight redundancy, and one line ("My work has always required...") edges toward expository throat-clearing.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elian's perceptual signature—attuned to "opportunity" not "threat," fluent in the graffiti language—is consistent and specific. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("driftingly alert calm," "tinkersong wonder"), matching the lyric-technical register of a balladeer-engineer. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("he could sense") are used sparingly. Distance tightens appropriately during the ritual. One register hiccup: "strange, digital echo of her soul" briefly imports contemporary tech jargon that clashes with "balladeer," "harp string," and "tinkersong."

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited POV remains stable and intimate throughout. Kael's perceptual signature—"warmly inquisitive," filtering discovery through duty and affection—is consistent and selective. Diction matches his station and focus (leather diary, brass goggles, vellum). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the discovery beats, pulling back slightly at closure to frame the resolve. No dialogue, so voice relies entirely on narrative texture, which succeeds. Minor register slip: "re-framed her entire existence" briefly edges toward essay diction, but recovers immediately. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Elias's perceptual signature (meteorologist's eye, emotional cartography) is consistent and voice-particular. Diction fits a scientist-poet hybrid ("rarefied," "repository," "incandescent") without jarring register shifts. The prose modulates appropriately: opening exposition compresses setup, middle observations tighten around concrete action, final beat slows into quiet certainty. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor: "dusty starlight" and "feathery strokes" trend toward stock lyricism, and dialogue is absent (not penalized per Global Dialogue Policy), but internal voice remains distinct throughout pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited close on Elara holds steady; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: fingertips sensitive from pigments, faceless dark as familiar refuge, focus on pattern over profile. Diction matches her artistic lens ("texture of their hopes," "fractal geography"). Filter verbs ("letting the world fall away") appear but feel voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the lock work and heartwood press. A few phrases ("a lifetime of mixing pigments and tracing sorrow") edge toward exposition but anchor in present action. Rhythmic control under pressure is clean, with short clauses tightening as machinery returns.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices wear patterns, archived phrases, bird geometry—observational specificity matched to a map apprentice's training. Diction stays controlled and period-appropriate: "shard of light," "upper atmospheres," "cartographer of living light." No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens during the breakthrough ("A sudden realization struck him with the force of a lightning strike"), then pulls back for the closing reflection. Minor slips: "driving by a hope that was as diligent as it was patient" and "sociable isolation transformed into a silent, profound communion" edge toward authorial summary rather than Elias's own lexicon under pressure. Filter verbs ("watched," "noticed," "saw") are functional but cluster in observational beats; tighter immediacy would lift the band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable psychic distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: "hauntingly bright," "water-smoothed wood held in the hand," "driftwood nostalgia." Diction remains elevated but consistent, matching the mythic register. The prose modulates effectively under pressure—short clauses during the uncapping ("With a steady hand, she began") versus lush description in calmer beats. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than habitual. No head-hopping, and the lexicon fits the character's role as a lineage-bound locksmith working in a frozen archive.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV through Elara remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (tracing the butterfly wings, seeing the ghost's message with a "true, untroubled smile") provides some texture, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("formless presence," "symphony of desperation") that sits uneasily with survival-mode urgency. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Kaelen's grumble and Elara's reply carry subtext but do not advance plot through indirection or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance controlled and perceptual signature anchored in Elias's calm, elegiac register. Diction is elevated but consistent ("filigrees of soft, golden light," "bruised awe") and voice-motivated for the mythic-fable tone. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Register remains stable under emotional pressure (the final dissolution maintains the same cadence as the opening). One friction: phrases like "purveyor of its quietest grace" and "breathtaking, impossible arrogance" edge toward abstract philosophical summary rather than staying rooted in Elias's concrete perception, briefly pulling the reader out of embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Elias's sensory and emotional filter throughout. Diction ("blighted orchard of stone and gears," "offhandedly exact," "weary nonchalance") is distinct and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature: he notices the labyrinth's geometry, the birds' "deadly geometry," and the frost's arrival with a craftsman's eye. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during assembly, slightly wider in the final paragraph's summary stance). No dialogue present; no POV leakage. Minor texture note: a few filter constructions ("he heard," "he watched") are functional rather than intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Aris throughout; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the foam observation. Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: chemistry vocabulary ("enzymatic breakdown," "polymerization," "surfactants") filters every observation without becoming caricature. Diction stays within plausible register for a reflective scientist. No dialogue on the page to assess. Minor register drift: "symphonically minded" and "nave of a cathedral" feel slightly elevated for the established voice under peak stress, though they remain legible. Purposeful compression in the insight paragraph ("the way understanding comes as the pieces fall into place") supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; distance is consistent and controlled. The perceptual signature is distinct (measuring silence, tracing negative space) and the prose carries rhythmic variation that modulates with pressure. "Glimmering parole" and similar elevated phrases occasionally drift into lyric register that feels imposed rather than character-native, though the effect remains legible. No dialogue is present (correctly, given the solitary scene). Elision of the shop's "lull" customers is purposeful compression that serves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance tightens under pressure ("He didn't fight them or hoard them; he became a conduit"). Diction is consistently elevated and particular ("shovel scraping rock," "peeled back the sand like a scab"). The Warlord's single line of dialogue is spare and functional. Minor register drift: "emotionally contagious touch was the anvil upon which his own soul was hammered" reads slightly expository mid-crisis, though it clarifies the core constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent focalization through Elias. Voice carries a distinct texture—"hush of borrowed starlight," "metallic teardrop"—and perceptual signature (brass armature, waveform monitor, psychic noise). The interspersing of languages (C++, German lullaby, Ukrainian harvest poem) creates purposeful multi-register effect that serves the concept. Distance control is clean. However, some elevated diction ("empathetically decisive," "polyphonic chorus") risks register drift from the established voice, particularly during high-pressure beats where more embodied perception would sharpen focus.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct elevated/lyric register ("pages of stone," "silver ink," "helix-minded"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara's engineer's lens and recursive thinking filter all observations. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("This period of profound transformation... was to her a Great Theft") that tells rather than shows, and the diction at peak stress ("chaotically precise rhythm, each pulse a hammer blow") leans on stock metaphor. No head-hopping, no dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt a profound shift") are acceptable within this voice-motivated style.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: Kael's prism-mind filters setting and object details through archival logic. Diction is elevated but coherent ("clandestinely luminous," "serpentine grotto") and matches the fantastical register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the scramble. One slip: "clandestineyl luminous" is a typo that momentarily disrupts line-level control, but voice remains otherwise distinct and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("a weight Elara carried in her bones," "a fabric without a thread of song") that remains coherent under pressure. Diction fits Elara's sculptural sensibility (e.g., "filigree," "lexicon of strain"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the performance, pulling back slightly for the final image. The phrase "symphonically minded brain" is slightly diagnostic, but it lands early and is dramatized through her anticipation of notes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with Kaelan's perceptual signature throughout: chess metaphors (pawns, bishops, checkmate), tutor's precision, exile's ache. Diction matches his educated, analytical voice ("perplexing forces," "translating silence," "resonant frequency"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (thumb groove, tear) to wider (cosmic scholar). Minor slip: "hopeful melancholy of the moment settled over him" tells the tone rather than embodying it in the final sensory beat, and "he was no longer a tutor…he was a scholar" articulates the shift rather than showing micro-choice aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice sustains a theatrical-poetic register—"varieties of silence," "velvet fabric," "chrysanthemums of gold"—with synesthetic interiority that remains character-particular throughout. Psychic distance stays close; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. Dialogue to the diary and machines ("Now, my dear") integrates voice with action. Minor strain: "feeling in his chest" is generic at a peak beat, and "smiled" at closure lacks the embodied contradiction that would elevate the ending to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focused on Elara's sensory experience; perceptual signature is distinct (olfactory primacy, "she could smell the thirst of a leaf"). Diction stays consistent with character register: "quiescent life," "bouquet," "nutty, earthy aroma." Psychic distance narrows during the sensory assault and widens slightly at closure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("could smell," "threatened to overwhelm") in peak stress moments slightly dull immediacy, though voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "gossamer-fruit," "whirling silence," "shimmering fish caught in the inverted river" build a distinct texture. Free-indirect style is clean. Minor filter-verb density ("she watched, mesmerized") in the cavern beat slightly dulls immediacy, and the final paragraph shifts toward summary ("She had not found a simple cure; she had found…") rather than holding the skiff-landing image. Rhythm modulates well with action, and no dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single third-person limited POV held throughout with stable psychic distance. Narrative voice carries distinct texture: "cathedral of stillness," "the physics of the quiet," "the terrible math." Diction remains controlled and purpose-driven ("corrugated steel towers," "fleeting memory," "the ghost of the event"). Perceptual signature reflects Kaelen's investigative lens (wind patterns, vectors, convergence). Filter verbs ("believed," "understood") are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor slip: "His motivation was satisfied" in the penultimate section slightly externalizes what could be shown through reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable, and the perceptual signature—synesthetic colors as sound—is distinct and sustained. Register is elevated and purposeful, matching the mythic tone. However, high-register diction in peak beats ("oscillating repose," "verdant light that tasted of new grass") risks overwriting without dramatic friction to ground it. The narrative stance remains consistent, with no head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "deliberate grace of a man who had nothing left but purpose," "oiled leather ties came undone with a soft hiss." Diction remains consistent under pressure with purposeful elevation that fits the quasi-mystical frame. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tightens during the flute-playing, pulls back slightly for the insight articulation. Minor slip: "avalanchingly quiet" reads slightly strained as coined modifier, though it's voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("He felt her then") are sparse and voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited holds Elias's POV cleanly; his perceptual signature (empathy as data, sorrow as theorem) is distinct. The prose modulates: detached geometry during the press operation, then "lucid turbulence" as air thickens. Anya's brief quoted whisper contrasts with Elias's dry rasp, though she speaks only twice. Minor filter-verb density ("seemed to," "realized with") in the final paragraph slightly dulls immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-limited, with stable distance. Kael's perceptual signature is anxiety-colored: "unnervingly loud," "frayed nerves," "gnawing anxiety." Under peak pressure (aurora event), diction compresses appropriately ("Time warped," "breathless") and internal texture holds. Elara's voice in memory is warm and distinct ("the path is the purpose"), though we hear it only once. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he watched") appear in the climax but serve clarity in a supernatural moment. Minor slip: "Now revealed itself" and "the magic" edge toward expository distance when immediacy would heighten the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature—scientific solemnity, "firmly grounded," mantra repetition—filters all description. Diction ("lattice of pale, crystalline stone," "canvas of impossible, feathery detail") fits his mystic-researcher hybrid voice. The single line of dialogue ("Energy is never lost...") reads as ritualistic self-address, not conversation, and advances his stance. Minor slip: "truthful lie" in the opener verges on abstract philosophizing, though it's reprised concretely at closure. Rhythmic control tightens under the sunrise beat without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (thread, shuttle, weaving metaphors filter all perception). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("stoically sparkling," "gossamer connection") that edges past the focalizer's grounded idiom, and "raveling silence" as descriptor trends abstract. No head-hopping. The prose reflects Elara's mind under pressure, though some filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") dull immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Diction is character-specific: "hope, a far more stubborn material," "captured twilight," "defiance in the face of deathly silence." Narrative certainty matches Elian's knowledge (intuition screaming for the geode, belief in wounds as healing-points). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ritual. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the perceptual signature (hands "too gentle," deliberate sacred movement) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael perceives in sensory frequencies, scents, and structural sound. Diction remains controlled—"cartographer of ghosts," "layered transparencies," "river of raw power"—and reflects his technical expertise without register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the peak beat. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The voice modulates with pressure, compressing syntax at the climax ("He pushed") without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Silas's perceptual signature—silent economy, sea-creature attunement, spatial problem-solving—is consistent and distinct. Diction remains within his register (oilskins, skiff, spyglass, fuel line). Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the storm and lantern room. The "warmly observant gaze" phrase risks slight elevation but reads as Silas's felt experience. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short bursts during the storm, longer reflection in the stone-building closure. No dialogue; all interiority is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (technical apparatus, cosmic scale, manic joy). Diction ("bruise of violet," "furious contained nova," "shadowed wonder") is character-particular and rhythmically controlled. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; distance modulates purposefully from external action to internal tremor at closure, meeting the 9+ quick test for voice control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV first person is stable; perceptual signature (dye-master's attention to hue, structure, refraction) is consistent and character-specific. The dialogue exchange feels purpose-driven and advances the thematic question. Two slips lower the score: "valley-mist wonder I felt in my soul" drifts into abstract poeticism, and the woman's confirming line about the donor reads as helpful exposition rather than dramatized subtext. Syntax and rhythm remain controlled, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear, keeping the piece in the solid 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices "dust motes dancing" and the shard's "internal misery," a baroque precision that fits his archival role. Diction remains consistent—"phantasmagoria," "quantified sorrow," "mundane miracle"—calibrated to a character who would name his craft poetically. No dialogue appears; the piece sustains its lone-watchman voice without convergence. Free indirect style is clean: "He believed their sorrow, when they fell, was the densest of all" reads as his thought without a filter verb. Psychic distance tightens during the vision sequence (sapling, saw, fall) then pulls back for the mosaic placement, a purposeful modulation. Minor filter-verb cluster in the vision paragraph ("He saw... He knew...") slightly dulls immediacy but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's world is filtered through synesthetic memory (four-note phrase "felt like the color yellow") and poetic diction ("humid air," "spider's thread voice"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, narrowing at the climax. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully—short clauses at the song's start, longer at the swell. However, some filter-verb stacking ("she knew," "she needed") and slightly elevated register ("nascent sun," "vortex of burgeoning energy") drift from intimate interiority during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias filters through sensation ("low-grade fever of the spirit," "frantic bird against his ribs") and the narrative distance remains stable. The prose modulates under pressure (short clauses during Elara's entrance, longer cadence at resolution). Minor: "another story resting peacefully on its ancient shelves" is a self-aware metaphor that edges toward authorial wink, and "weary grace" + "invisible weight he could now perceive" blend observation with mild filter-stack. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "the creeping normality of decay," runs her thumb over "unyielding crust," and sees the courtyard as "a map of a place that now existed only in memory." Diction ("communion," "guerrilla gardening," "heuristically gentle") fits an educated, observant focalizer. The patrolman's brief dialogue ("My mother waited in line...every Saturday") carries subtext and goal (recognition, not enforcement) without overarticulation. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the encounter. Minor slip: "heuristically gentle" in narration feels slightly authorial rather than Elara's exact internal idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Kaelen's sensory field and lexicon ("quartz hush," "gently meticulous," "resonator apparatus"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he ignores the "poignant image" to focus on readouts, a character-specific filter. Diction shifts under pressure ("desperate precision," "screamed a single…tone") without breaking voice. The whispered "Hold" is the sole dialogue, purposeful and swallowed by silence. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he had to") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor deduction: "His motivation was not to halt the end…" in the middle block edges toward helpful-narrator summary, slightly flattening the present frame, though it remains anchored to his task.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-particular: "metallic tang of unspoken agreements," "ghost in homespun," "chips of obsidian." Elara's perceptual signature (sound-focused, market-literate) filters every detail. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext—Boro's dismissal, Silas's sneer, Elara's calm declaration to Eva. Free indirect style is clean. One wobble: "his panic he couldn't contain" slightly breaches strict focalization (Elara infers but the phrasing asserts interior certainty). Diction remains consistent under pressure; no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (sensory taste-focus, skeptical inner monologue) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during taste detection, pulling back for the aurora's celestial curtain call). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "phantom harbor," "vessels") that reads slightly外 Elara's scientist pragmatism, though the poetic lens could be voice-motivated given the setting's speculative frame. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Compression at the convergence beat (carriers "blinked, looking at each other with…dawning recognition") maintains coherence without line-level opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Elias's eidetic, artistic perception ("cataloging every brushstroke," "hands so used to broad strokes of charcoal"). Diction is character-particular ("monument to his own youthful impatience," "vibrant chaos his photorealistic work erased"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees the world as surfaces and light. The single brief dialogue (Anya's memory) is natural and advances the core conflict. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Register remains consistent; no corporate drift. Free indirect thought is clean ("She had not painted the cave as it was, but as it *could be*"). Slight over-reliance on filter verbs in the opening ("felt heavy," "felt a deep, primal need") but they read voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: calligrapher's precision, obsession with "candor in small moments," and attention to texture. The prose modulates well under pressure ("strange hope bloomed," "breathtaking rush"). Minor slip: "He understood everything in a sudden, breathtaking rush" tells the epiphany rather than enacting it through specific realization beats. Diction stays consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elian's perceptual signature filters all detail through his craft focus (thermal chisels, resonating forks, facets as "potential harmony"). Diction remains elevated but consistent ("muted vigor," "lattice of frozen light," "translator") and voice-motivated by the post-verbal, post-contemporary setting. Distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens slightly at the crescendo ("feeling the vibrant colors…wash over him") without breaking the established register. One minor quibble: "whispering bluff," "pearlescent sky," and "crystalline clarity" lean slightly purple in aggregate, though each individually serves the post-verbal, synesthetic world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person android throughout; perceptual signature is distinct ("my chassis," "my processors scream," "sensors"). Diction remains within the android's lexicon while carrying Elara's emotional residue. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows. One mild filter-verb stack in the climax ("threatening to fragment," "I lock onto") slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains clean and purposeful under pressure. Rhythmic control supports escalation without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("thumb long since turned to dust," "sandstorm calm") that fits the contemplative curator lens. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the locket revelation, and Elias's perceptual signature (objects as history, listening over interrogation) is consistent. Dialogue from Mrs. Petrov, Mateo, and Mr. Chen distinguishes idiom lightly (reedy hum, chest-puffing boy energy, hurried worker recall) and advances the clue accumulation. Minor register drift: "vibrant courtyard," "reedy hum," and "sandstorm calm" occasionally feel authorial rather than Elias-specific, but control holds under pressure and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature: "the sound having long ago woven itself into the fabric of her silence," lyrical diction fitting a code breaker. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("soft as silt," "breath…drawn from the ocean itself"). No head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, image-rich texture. Minor note: a few elevated phrases ("purist of logic," "ultimate act of translation") lean slightly toward abstraction but remain within an intellectual character's register.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with clean focalization through Silas's perceptual signature: "the soft clink of his lantern's hood," "the marrow of his bones." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the ritual, slightly wider when establishing the world). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("curdling from peace," "gleaming silence"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects Silas's mind under pressure—compressed, precise—and the narrative certainty matches what he can plausibly know. Minor slip: "pockets of gravity that littered their reality like unseen dust motes" leans slightly expository, though it remains anchored to Silas's attunement. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance and tense are consistent. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric-fantasy register ("insidious rustle of a contagion," "terrestrially cosmic," "placid inferno") that remains coherent under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—Elara listens *past* sound to gaps and voids—but the prose occasionally tilts toward elevated abstraction ("architecture of fate," "overwhelming peace") that reads more authorial than character-specific. No dialogue appears; filter verbs ("she felt," "she sensed") appear but are voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Clara with a lyric register ("grammar of groaning pipes," "wreathed in the scent of dust") that matches her obsession. Elias's dialogue carries distinct idiom: "You are listening for the rhythm, not the noise." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during tactile learning moments, wider during the rooftop revelation. Minor diction slip: "curdle into a need for truth" edges toward elevated metaphor slightly outside Clara's established texture, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and distance is controlled. Diction elevates consistently ("charmed skeptic," "sibilant hiss," "nimbus in the sun") in a voice that reads as literary-omniscient rather than character-specific. Under peak stress, the prose maintains ornate register ("tragically radiant," "mosaic of his identity") where compression or rougher grain might better embody crisis. Elian's perceptual signature is more authorial than individual, and internal monologue feels polished beyond what urgency would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Kaelen's focalization with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: professional focus on tools, ink viscosity, pressure, heritage. Diction ("pearl twilight," "calibrated treason," "forgery of compassion," "philosophical impossibility") is elevated but voice-motivated and legible, matching a scholarly forger's interior lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the execution beat, widening slightly at closure. Narrative certainty matches what Kaelen knows (years of study, the glyph's secret) without withholding. Rhythm and syntax vary under pressure (short fragments during the thorn's descent, longer reflection at peace). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Tense and stance remain stable. A minor register note: "wisely enduring the immense pressure" leans slightly expository, but the phrase recurs as motif and the effect supports theme.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited throughout, with consistent perceptual signature: Lyra "felt less in her ears and more in the marrow of her bones." Diction remains character-appropriate, though occasional phrases ("webs of intrigue," "reed-blown melancholy") feel slightly ornamental rather than organically emerging from her consciousness. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity—compressed urgency in the final chamber, reflective spaciousness in the mother's memory. No head-hopping, and the voice sustains a coherent lyric register without slipping into therapy-speak or Wikipedia.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; diction is elevated but consistent with a specialized, solitary practitioner. Perceptual signature is present (the "breath-hollowed space," "wreck-diver of a peculiar sort") and voice modulates appropriately under pressure. The phantom dialogue ("It was an accident") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "a lie solidified" and "psychic theater" edge toward expository labeling rather than trusting the image. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature (net-mender philosopher's vocabulary: "brine and tar," "hidden effort," "shimmering, shifting net"). Diction occasionally elevates ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") in ways that feel slightly exterior to the focalizer's plausible lexicon, though the effect is consistent and the voice remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping, no dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean; the whistle beat compresses naturally. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tea ritual, pulled back during descent, intimate at the whistle moment). Minor register drift into lyric abstraction at peaks, but legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance throughout with no head-hopping. Kaelen's perceptual signature—clinical, methodical, pattern-seeking—shapes every observation: "murky, industrial-grade stone," "tweezers, a large table, and the patient reassembling." The professional register ("localized anomaly," "isotopic decay," "phenomenal stability") fits the character's expertise without academic drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the reassembly work, pulling back slightly for the antenna climb. The prose reflects an engineer's mind through syntax and vocabulary. Minor pressure: some sentence openings recycle structure ("Kaelen walked," "Kaelen climbed," "Kaelen raised," "Kaelen lowered") creating mild template cadence in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (ozone, static, bruised-indigo). Diction is elevated and atmospheric, matching the visionary-prophet role without breaking into corporate register. The phrase "lyrically prophetic sorrow that tasted of ozone and regret" exemplifies controlled figurative density. However, "gritty whimsy" is announced rather than enacted—grimness dominates, whimsy is label-only. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during panic, wider during exposition). No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with the poet's perceptual signature: he notices sound-texture ("thin, high whistle," "deep, resonant hum") over visual detail. Diction is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated for a solitary artist: "gleaned redemption," "lonesome splendor," "small, daily sin of letting beauty die unheard." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the performance beat. However, some phrases approach writerly over-reach ("the dense, weighted silence of a child's silenced joy") where the register slightly exceeds the POV's lived moment, and "positively wistful" in the opening reads more authorial than character-felt.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices sonic and mechanical detail first, filtered through her engineer's training. Vocabulary ("hydrographic chart," "star-forged iron," "vibrational matching") is profession-apt and consistent. The prose modulates under stress—short clauses during the shriek, longer reflection afterward—without head-hopping. Two minor register slips: "fleshly ethereal" and "parasitic soundwave" feel authorial rather than character-voiced, and "sonic absolution" announces theme rather than letting Elara's perception carry it. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during peak stress, and interiority remains embodied rather than diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV stays stable throughout with distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen's technical precision ("hairline scratch on her windowpane," "chronometer ticked softly") layered with poetic restraint ("silver thread of the primary moon"). Register occasionally elevates beyond focalization—"a yoke on the city," "clockwork engine of liberation"—but remains mostly character-apt for someone trained in celestial observation. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close bodily sensation ("wild animal clawing at her ribs") to wider tactical awareness. The final "frantic drum against her ribs" echoes opening imagery with earned closure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature is consistent (empirical, measured, resisting the irrational). Diction is controlled and professional without stiffness. The sensory intrusions ("frantic hope," "consuming need") are clearly marked as not-his-own, maintaining clean focalization. Minor slips: "preventable death investigator" reads slightly expository in the opening, and "fortified quiet" in the final line, while thematically apt, tips toward authorial poetry rather than Elias's internal idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Arthur; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on his interiority, pulling back for Elias's dialogue). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("We talk a lot about what we deserve in a place like that"). Perceptual signature is consistent (Arthur notices the shop's quiet as "louder, more expectant" because he's accustomed to penitentiary noise). Minor: a few filter verbs and slightly elevated diction ("aptly deliberate grace," "profound empathy") read more as narrator assist than Arthur's lived idiom under pressure, though they remain within broad plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice-specific: "beautiful disaster," "no sense building a church if you're afraid to pray," "sacrilegious joy." Kaelen's perceptual signature is selective—he notices the glyph's "starburst of light" as a verb, not a word—and his diction mixes tinkerer pragmatism with quasi-mystical awe. The psychic distance tightens at the climax ("Grip!" yelled at the wing itself, not the controls). Dialogue to self ("Come on, you beautiful disaster") and inner monologue are distinct and idiomatic. No head-hopping; elision of the months of work is efficient and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV with tight focalization through Elara; no head-hopping. Distance remains stable, modulating appropriately during the Kael confrontation ("This was the moment her entire search balanced upon"). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Kael's casual "Find anything interesting in the legacy stacks?" carries threat through context, and Elara's lie ("just clearing out some recursive code loops") reads as goal-driven subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices numbers, patterns, and digital architecture—though the "brightly attentive" label in paragraph one is asserted rather than shown through selective attention. Register occasionally drifts: "a euphemism for janitor of a dead social network" and "Corporate Memory Keeper" read as authorial commentary rather than Elara's idiom, and "recursive code loops near the old audio kernel" feels like jargon inserted for verisimilitude rather than voice-motivated phrasing. The final image ("its silver threads cool against her skin") anchors the POV in embodied sensation, but earlier beats rely more on conceptual framing than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV through Kael is stable and clean. His perceptual signature—calmly intuitive, attuned to objects and emotional undercurrents—is consistent. The dialogue (Kael's revelations, Mara's accusation) is purposeful and advances plot. Minor weaknesses: some phrasing is elevated beyond the immediate stakes ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "the weighted breath still had not been fully expelled"), and Kael's interior occasionally drifts into prompt-echo ("courageous anomaly"). The prose modulates appropriately from tense accusation to quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "clipped-off sentences," reality as water in palms, patience as old fabric with folds. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control peaks in the closure beat: "low groan…prolonged, sighing crackle…thousand crystalline heartbeats slowing." Diction matches her educated, contemplative stance throughout. The "windborne solace" phrase and "grips reality loosely" metaphor sustain voice under pressure without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV held throughout; psychic distance is intimate and stable. Perceptual signature is viticulturist-specific: "Mourvedre...craved blistering heat," "Grenache spirit, needing dappled light." Diction remains controlled—"gently persuasive as a creeping vine," "scorched filigree"—and modulates with emotional shifts without jarring register breaks. Purposeful compression in the reflective mode is taught early and sustained; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is controlled and appropriate. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("loom of sound," "salt in water," "bleaching sun") that matches the mythic setting without slipping into generic fantasy idiom. Internal voice remains consistent under pressure ("whisperfield calm," "peripheral awareness"). No head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("The prophet's words are not a club…") reads natural and purpose-driven, advancing plot by rejecting the distortion. Perceptual signature is clear: Kael notices "slight curve in their straightest lines of logic."

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (archivist's eye for contours, "hidden arcs") and word choice ("dove gray," "earnest whimsy") creates distinct texture. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and wider reflection. The prose occasionally slips into elevated diction ("a quiet communion," "geography of a community's heart") that reads slightly above the immediate scene's register, but voice coheres under pressure. No dialogue present to judge. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (photographs, vines) and the narrative stance supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: "a man folded into the shape of a question mark," "reticent nature perfectly suited," sensory focus on acoustic detail. Diction is elevated yet character-appropriate for an aging scholar: "poignantly obsolete," "ghost of a sound," "Rosetta Stone of acoustic history." The prose modulates effectively from the physical (cool crystal, complaining joints) to the abstract (pattern recognition) without losing embodiment. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess; psychic distance is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a consistent perceptual signature: Silas notices sonic textures ("hum of potential energy"), tactile grounding (chalk's "dusty texture"), and temporal metaphors fitting his obsession. Diction stays within his artistic-prophet register even under stress. The prose modulates purposefully—longer, layered sentences during approach compress to shorter beats at the climax ("This was it"). Filter verbs ("he could almost feel," "he was clinging") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than distancing. No head-hopping, clean focalization. Minor debt: "tidal longing" recurs as a phrase in ways that risk becoming a tic rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Elias's perceptual signature (sensory focus on precision, "internal sense of rightness," "whisper of alignment") is character-specific and consistent under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but functional, serving plot advancement. Psychic distance tightens effectively during the climactic alignment sequence ("his entire consciousness narrowing"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose texture modulates appropriately from serene opener to high-tension climax to quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds on Elara with stable distance; no head-hopping. Diction elevates at times ("cantilever," "cadence," "radiant haven") in ways that feel designed rather than organically character-specific—Elara's internal texture reads serene but not distinctly idiomatic. The "decisively kind force" and "pulsing stillness" phrases recur as motifs but also signal a controlled, almost mannered voice. Filter verbs ("felt less like," "felt like") are sparse and voice-motivated; dialogue is minimal but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's scholarly precision colors diction ("esoteric question," "topological knot," "dimensionally thin crease"). Psychic distance tightens during the key sequence without head-hopping. Register is consistent—elevated but character-appropriate—and no filter-verb stacks appear. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression ("by closing loops") is taught early and paid off at closure, meeting the experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (bone-setter's tactile focus, rational idiom under pressure). Distance control is clean with free indirect style. However, some diction drifts into elevated register not fully earned by Elias's voice: "beautiful fiction," "nostalgic innovation," "cartography of his own failures" read slightly authorial rather than character-specific. The final paragraph's rhythm supports the meditative closure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Overall voice is purposeful but not fully distinct under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Elara's perceptual signature: star charts, constellation kinship, oceanic tumbling. Diction is elevated and lyric ("zephyr bloom," "cataract," "nova"), consistent with a reflective, isolated observer. Two minor slips lower the score: "reflectively vibrant" (paragraph four) reads as an invented hybrid adjective outside natural lexicon, and the phrase "a zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding" (paragraph three) strains metaphoric coherence. Psychic distance remains close; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the prose rhythm modulates from meditative to triumphant without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: her botanical lens ("fragile biome," "graft new meaning"), selective attention to humidity and moisture patterns. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the gesture, pulling back for the shared hush). Diction is consistently elevated but not clashing ("honeyed hush," "shouting in a library"); the prose feels purposeful rather than overwrought. Brief interior access to Kaelen ("deafening roar of a million unseen judgments") reads as Elara's inference rather than head-hopping, though one phrase risks slight distance slip.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("the whisper of closing pages," "swirling hush," "quiet, aching clarity") that suits the reflective, mythic tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias filters the nexus through memory and regret. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo appearances") that feels authorial rather than character-particular, especially given the sustained intensity of figurative language. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the prose leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction where concrete sensory anchors would sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance; Elian's perceptual signature (tinkerer's ear detecting dissonance, puzzling melody "like a broken gear train") is character-specific. Diction modulates purposefully from mundane ("grease and pollen") to elevated ("luminous coin," "tableaus") as the ritual intensifies, voice-motivated by the sacred context. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "ephemeral movements a perfect chronicle" and "the attribute of this sacred vine" momentarily slip toward exposition rather than Elian's immediate perception. Prose rhythm reflects his methodical focus, and the closing shift to "deeper silence" supports closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tight; distance is close enough to access Kaelen's marrow-listening yet maintains narrative control. Diction is elevated but consistent—"flash-paper alchemist," "safekept starlight," "moving stillness"—and suits the lyric, ritualistic tone. Perceptual signature is clear: Kaelen notices rhythm, light, decay, the child's name. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "a thought given form, a prayer made tangible" edges toward over-articulation at the closure beat, slightly diluting the image's directness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a controlled, elevated register that fits the cavern's marble solemnity and Elian's reflective nature. Diction remains consistent ("lattice of spun silver," "resonator tuned…by geometry"). However, phrases like "the ghost of the machine's operation" and "a forgotten physics of memory" drift toward lyric abstraction that occasionally obscures the concrete work being done, and the lexicon's uniform elevation prevents stress from compressing syntax or sharpening perception at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; the focalizer's perceptual signature is distinct ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," psychic current as sensory medium). Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("boundary-lessly trapped," "frantic, chaotic thing"). No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Kaelen's knowledge. Free indirect style is clean and tense/stance remain stable. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (opening backstory, then real-time ritual, then reflection at closure). Hairline slip: "immense care" and "immense use" recur within close proximity, a minor vocabulary echo that does not harm clarity but reduces rhythmic variety slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "a man of immense presence who had vanished like a breath on a cold day, leaving behind only echoes and the scent of sawdust." Diction remains within Elara's plausible lexicon; elevated phrasing ("crystallized time," "ocean of stillness") reads voice-motivated rather than imposed. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity: short, grounded sentences during the carving ("She lifted the screaming kettle from the heat") contrast with longer, reflective periods in memory. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited with clear perceptual filters: "temporal anchor was loose," sound "congealed like amber." Diction is consistent (scavenger idiom, technical fragments like "harmonics report"). Ghost dialogue is distinct and accusatory. Two slips lower the score: "fractured stillness" and "eroded ambitions" recur as authorial motif rather than Kael's lived thought, and "the chronological confusion...sharpened into a sickeningly clear memory" wobbles between metaphor and literal perceptual claim without anchoring which.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all detail through Elara's engineering perspective: "functionally creative," "frequency she understood better than words." Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible engineer register ("hallowed glow of an alien sky," "stoic wonder"). The narrative voice is distinct and purposeful, though some metaphors ("ghost of a ghost") feel ornamental. Perceptual signature—noticing gradations, schematics, power flows—is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature tied to Elias's reverence ("movements excruciatingly gentle") and craft ("fingers, stained with the ink of countless recorded hours"). Diction balances literary texture ("portage," "nascent sunlight") with clarity; no register drift. Distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the bell-arranging ritual, broader during backstory anchoring. One minor slip: "The motivation that had driven him here was simple and sharp" tells rather than dramatizes, but the surrounding interiority compensates. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout, filtering all perception through Kael's particular attention (tactile salvage method, the sundial riddle, his grandfather's whisper). Diction is consistent and purposeful: "errant legend seeker," "architecture of lies," "leviathan." The prose modulates appropriately from tense retrieval ("muscles coiling") to serene closure ("utterly serene"). No dialogue appears, which fits the solitary nocturnal quest. One minor slip: "a profound hindsight clarity washed over Kael" edges toward filter-heavy exposition where the insight could be more embodied in his handling of the sundial or the blueprints.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance controlled. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices abrasions, tensions, the "gnarled fist of hemp," filtering setting through his patient, preservation-minded lens. Diction is elevated and poetic ("nascent forms," "tactile language," "cartography") and fits the contemplative voice. However, peak-beat syntax in the fourth paragraph—"This twist here, a measure of the swell's height; that loop there, the timing needed to avoid a hidden sandbar"—compresses crucial discovery into summary rather than dramatizing the decoding moment, flattening immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen notices texture, scent, color, and metaphoric resonance in a studious, meditative register. Diction is elevated but voice-coherent ("translocation," "cartography," "mythic beauty"). Distance modulates purposefully from close sensory immersion during the projection to wider reflection in the final paragraph. One friction: the projection sequence narrates Elara's interiority with unearned certainty—"fierce, determined hope," "a pain so vast she decided to chart it"—crossing from inference into omniscience without a cue that this is Kaelen's interpretive lens rather than established fact. The closing paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("not a woman who had vanished, but a cartographer who had finally arrived") leans ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a consistent elevated, almost archaic tone ("quaking reverie," "chasm of interlocking gears") that fits a prince in a decaying palace. Psychic distance is controlled, and there is no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—many phrases could belong to any melancholic nobleman—and the diction occasionally drifts into stock epic register ("object of his quaking reverie," "testament to its flawed genesis") without character-specific idiosyncrasy, particularly under peak pressure (hatching beat).

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, psychic distance controlled. Diction is purposeful and voice-specific: "kelp-drift peace," "ghost ship on a glassy sea," "the whisper of wind across the dunes." Elara's perceptual signature is professional and poetic. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she saw not just its destruction, but...") fit the meditative tone. The prose modulates under pressure (short beats during the fire, longer reflection at the lagoon). Minor register drift: "unyielding compassion, a rebellion against the blood in her veins" slightly elevates above her lived idiom in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's analytical lens; perceptual signature is consistent (light, architecture, breadcrumbs). Diction is elevated and controlled, though some phrases ("realistically imaginative," "defiant hush," "sidereal patience") read slightly register-formal for peak action and may reflect prompt language rather than organic voice. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains close and purposeful. The prose modulates from analytical to awed at closure, supporting the emotional beat, but the vocabulary occasionally tilts toward thesis-like specificity rather than lived immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and elevated—"vessel for feelings too vast for a heart," "the quiet sigh of falling petals"—but the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("immense, sentimental soul") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Xylar experiences the garden through empathy and inherited memory. The prose modulates purposefully from melancholy drift to decisive transmission at the end. Minor filter-verb cluster in the final paragraph ("was a broadcast," "was a light," "was finally") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV remains stable with consistent third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "weight of each new name not as stone, but as silence," "thundering calm," texture-focused attention. Diction stays controlled and purpose-driven, modulating appropriately under emotional pressure. Free indirect style is clean. One minor register drift: "spectral mentorship" and "fiercely meditative state" edge toward elevated vocabulary that slightly exceeds the established texture, though they remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person close POV is stable and controlled, with psychic distance tightening during the ritual's peak (the pause, the letting-go struggle). Elias's perceptual signature—gear oil/brine, metallic heartbeat, "searing reverie"—is specific and voice-consistent. Diction remains calibrated to his precision and care: "absolute stillness," "incremental absolution," "micro-adjustment." Minor register lift in "ethically diligent nature screamed" feels slightly authorial, though the phrase "balance was not about containment; it was about release and return" reads on-voice for his reflective mindset. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The pendulum's "faint groan" anchors the return to present with clear distance modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices "velveteen gloom," "lonely gleam," "frayed threads"—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("birdsong after a storm," "cherished blanket") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's tenderness ("cobalt dome…held the stars…with tenderness") reads slightly detached from Elias's prior workman focus. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "believed") are voice-motivated and legible. Diction is largely consistent but occasionally tilts poetic without clear urgency shift.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and intimate, with narrative distance controlled throughout. Perceptual signature reflects Kaelen's role: "vast, terrifying oceans of what was not," "groundedly imaginative force tethered to hard numbers." Diction modulates appropriately under pressure ("frantic pulse in his own ears"), and the analytical-engine framing avoids sorcery register. Minor template cadence in paragraph four ("what new crop…? What novel fishing…?") slightly flattens rhythm without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization through Elias's perceptual signature (he notices the dial glow, the mist, the pen's flow). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a distinct lyric texture ("thistled calm," "phantom signal," "ghost made of light"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, though the narrative distance remains somewhat elevated throughout rather than tightening further at the verification beat. Psychic distance and perceptual selectivity are character-specific and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled and diction fits her role ("charcoal portrait ash scatterer," "thread in the profound quiet"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: Elara's explanations weave truth carefully. One slip: "his heart a heavy, knowing stone" imports a metaphor that feels imported rather than organic to her perceptual signature. The prose modulates appropriately from exposition to ritual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "breathtakingly fine pitch" teeth and sedimentary strata, filtering the world through archival precision. Diction remains consistent ("abrasive calm," "old bone," "carefully constructed logic") and psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooming to the cog's detail, then pulling back to philosophical agonizing. The girl's dialogue feels natural and age-appropriate. Minor filter-verb clustering ("He had imagined," "he had found") in reflective passages does not flatten immediacy given the contemplative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and clean; Elias's perceptual signature (woodworking terms, "vanishing arts," the rosette as "microcosm") is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with elevated register ("fretwork," "grudging handshakes") that fits an educated choir director. The brief dialogue—"This is a piece of a zither…"—reads naturally and advances the thematic turn without exposition dump. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close in the library reflection, slightly pulled back during the rehearsal to accommodate the collective "they." No head-hopping; interiority remains Elias's throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization on Elias; perceptual signature is distinct (chef's palate, culinary metaphors, sensory prioritization). Diction fits the informal wisdom attribute: "gentle rebellion," "coaxing the plant's growth," "a quiet dance of creation." No dialogue present. Minor register drift in "guided synaptic plasticity" and "manifestation of a society's traumatic decline"—these phrases read slightly elevated beyond the established informal voice, though they remain within plausible narrator lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate tasting beats to wider framing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV (Silas) is stable; psychic distance is controlled. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Lena's worn-thin voice, Silas's flat factual tone—and carries subtext (she knows his affliction, he knows her purpose). The perceptual signature is selective: Silas notices "syrupy, nectar dusk" and the lacquer box's swirl, filtering through his desire for wonder. Minor slip: "involuntary truthfulness" and "affliction" are label-heavy in the opening exchange, and the phrase "quiet, stubborn desire to preserve wonder in routine" edges toward expository interiority rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "bruised lavender," "fashionable contagion," "hushed blaze" all feel voice-motivated. Diction remains within Elara's introspective register throughout. One tension: "inadvertently profound" briefly breaks the fourth wall by labeling the character's own thought as profound, a narratorial intrusion. Filter verbs ("she believed," "a thought bloomed") are present but generally voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional beats. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-POV control is exemplary; Mara's perceptual signature (mission training recited, then fractured) remains consistent. Galen's telepathy is rendered as "presence," "pressure," "silver cord"—distinct from dialogue and free of head-hopping. Diction stays grounded: "silt," "gill," "sediment." The shift from certainty to "quiet, welcome complexity" at the end tracks her arc without register drift. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. One hairline note: "incisively kind" in paragraph one reads slightly elevated for immediate sensory apprehension, though it's defensible as Mara processing Galen's telepathic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable distance; Elian's perceptual signature filters setting through mathematical abstraction ("massive equation," "nexus point"). Diction choices ("esoteric," "theorems," "integers") stay in character; "not a clatter but a chime" modulates at peak pressure. Minor register drift: "balancedly daring" and "as-you-know" phrasing in "not instruments of chance but of memory" reads slightly expository mid-opening, though it recovers by grounding in the chipped die's concrete function. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is painter-specific (ochre, burnt sienna, saffron quiet, moon-tipped brush drinking light). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity: "waxing moon fought its way," "dialect the city had misplaced," "glyph from his imagined lexicon of grace." Psychic distance tightens at the climax—"his breath catching," heart hammering—then eases into the panoramic final image. No head-hopping, no filter clutter. Rhythm modulates: methodical in the painting beats, compressed in the waiting silence, expansive in the resolution. The prose feels singular and voice-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Alistair; psychic distance is consistent. Diction is elevated ("rosewater dread," "entombed in memory") and fits a cultured guide's interior voice, though phrases like "newfound authority" and "ragged hope" edge toward stock lyricism. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Elder Maeve's line carries resignation, and Alistair's commands ("Higher!" "Hold that note!") are urgent and goal-driven. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature—filtering the world through archival memory and professional habit—is clear. Under peak stress (the singing), the prose compresses appropriately without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual detail filtered through Elias's expertise ("perfect tolerance," "cascading weights"). Diction is elevated and consistent, fitting a solitary craftsman immersed in esoteric work. Some register drift occurs in peak moments: "bleak exhilaration," "profound thrum," "shimmering, terrifying potential" read as authorial gloss rather than Elias's idiom under stress. The prose loses some immediacy through filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") and abstract constructions when embodied sensation would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    First-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—seeing "afterimages" and "echoes of what was"—is consistent and character-specific. However, diction often drifts into elevated literary register ("cloying companion," "silken scrape," "annihilating focus," "repulsive allure") that feels authorial rather than embodied under funhouse stress. The prose reads as polished but not always voice-particular; under peak pressure (the mirror confrontation), the register stays formal rather than compressing into stress-driven syntax. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("restless euphony of survival," "blue hour bled across the sea"). Diction elevates under pressure without breaking voice; syntax modulates effectively from contemplative opening to percussive climax. No dialogue to judge. Minor register drift in phrases like "self-similar whorls" feels slightly external to Kai's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited, stable and apt. Distance stays close without head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (light as "visual music," dread as "physical thing," sun as "pressure"). Diction reflects a cartographer's idiom ("spidery script," "sonic syntax," "pattern languages") without register drift. No dialogue is present; the prose carries action through embodied perception. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climax (short clauses at the whistle's crack). Free indirect style is clean, and tense remains stable. Compression under peak stress (final paragraph) fits voice and intensifies momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Aris until the story pivots to Elara's perception in the final third; the shift is clean and occurs at a paragraph break, so no head-hopping. Narrative distance is controlled, with perceptual signature evident ("his task now officially begun," "careful excavation"). Dialogue feels formal and exposition-heavy ("It has bought us a century of peace" / "Peace is not the same as stability") but fits the historian-guardian register. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("metronome," "bedrock," "curator of a structural weakness") without register clash. Elara's brief interior turn ("weight seemed less like a sacred burden") anchors her shift but remains tell-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated diction ("viscous," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") matches Elias's formal, solitary interiority. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightening during the underwater scramble ("frantic, blind search"), releasing into reflective calm at closure. Free indirect style is clean; perception filters through professional and personal lenses (transit levels, datum points, heron's flight). No dialogue present. One minor register drift: "hushed blaze in his eyes" reads slightly exterior when we are otherwise deeply interior, but the effect is minimal and the final image coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (indexer's eye for dissonance, "dissatisfied with that conclusion"). Diction matches Elias's scholarly register ("saline-treated paper," "cartouche," "maker's mark") without drift. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under discovery pressure. The prose reflects his methodical mind through syntax and rhythm. Minor: "profound sense of peace...deeper than the fathoms" edges toward elevated metaphor in a high-pressure beat, but remains voice-coherent and does not obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates appropriately (closer during basilica vision, pulled back during transit). Perceptual signature is grief-tuned: lantern skeletons, heavy water, powdered starlight. Diction elevates but stays consistent ("aether," "mnemonic gem," "luminous torment") without mid-crisis register breaks. No dialogue to assess. Purposeful compression in the pilgrimage sequence (each isle triggers memory waves) accelerates without obscuring causality. Minor slip: "strange physics of the archipelago took hold" tells the rule rather than showing its sensory effect on Kaelen's body in that first step.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Amal's perceptual signature—physics metaphors, grief filtered through mathematics—is distinct and consistent. Diction ("needle in her soul," "festering heart," "bleak exhilaration") is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond immediate embodiment. The bracketed fragment "[intricately tangible a force as gravity" is an on-page artifact (incomplete sentence, unclear syntax) that disrupts voice coherence in a high-stakes beat. No dialogue present to assess, correctly avoiding it at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature filtering details through a "sharp-eyed drone pilot's gaze" and technical attention to "crystalline circuitry" and "stabilizers whining in protest." Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated. The phrase "perpetually surprised look, her default expression" reads as external narrator summary rather than Elara's self-perception, a brief psychic distance slip. Otherwise, focalization is controlled and interiority stays character-bound with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature ("acidic burn," "sieved hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though "manufactures false memories" and "structured absence" edge toward clinical register for a grief-stricken genealogist. Psychic distance modulates effectively at the driftwood discovery. Elias's professional lexicon justifies the genealogical and memory-trade terminology. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited FOV remains stable and close to Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (the wind as "only companion" at the end tightens intimacy). Diction is controlled and voice-distinct ("uncommonly thoughtful way," "dealer in fragile lives"), though "furrowed hush" in the opening reads slightly elevated for the POV's operational mindset. Dialogue is sparse but functional—Kaelen's "The lockbox" as statement rather than question conveys weary protocol adherence. One minor slip: "its weight a constant reminder" in paragraph two edges toward filter-verb passivity where embodied action (worrying the brass) already conveys the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("stoic, wooden bodies," "cartography of his failure") suits a navigator's perspective without tipping into pretension. POV distance is stable; psychic access remains tight to Elias throughout. Perceptual signature is clear: he reads landscape through navigational metaphor ("beached vessel," "keel broken"). Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control escalates under pressure: short, decisive syntax in the final paragraph ("He did not put it away. Instead…") propels the closure. No dialogue appears; voice remains coherent and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with a consistent narrative distance. The voice carries a distinct literary texture ("cathedral-like ceiling," "jaded wonder"), and the protagonist's perceptual filter is evident in his detachment. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("testament of despair," "aching blueprint of empathy") that feels more narrated than interior. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he noted") appear frequently without clear voice motivation, dulling immediacy at moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct elevated register ("vast, silent ocean contained within a calm shell"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately from grief to ritual focus to final embodiment. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the entire architecture of his life," "cosmic intimacy made manifest") that feels more thematic than character-grounded. The perceptual signature is consistent—focused on scent, texture, presence—but doesn't compress or fracture under the transformation's peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (cartomancer's fate-reading filtered through maternal terror). Diction stays within the POV's plausible lexicon, blending elevated ("phosphorescent," "skeins of fate") with embodied immediacy. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure, and the narrator's perceptual bias (seeing time as treasure/debt) is character-specific. One slip: "a choking beauty" and "aching soul" lean generic at peak beats where sharper embodiment would elevate. No dialogue present; interior voice carries the full load cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: gravitational response to emotion, tactile focus on coolness and weight, the spiritual/meditative framing. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "ghostly resolve," "leaden weight," "needle thin as a whisper" creating texture without forced lyricism. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during peak emotional beats (the final photograph). No dialogue present; interior voice is coherent and particular to Elara's meditative, patient character.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is controlled and poetic, with a consistent register ("vibrant hush," "philanthropist of moments"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the texture of transformation," "servant to a story far older than himself") that reads as authorial rather than Kael's lived perception. Filter verbs ("feeling as though," "seemed") appear frequently but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-particular; the way Kael notices things reads lyric and contemplative without distinct idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Kael's perceptual signature—"winking hush and secrets," vigilant scan, practiced casualness—is distinct. Diction is controlled: "bronze quill holder, tarnished from years of handling," "cradle of sparks," "nutrient flows." No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when Kael kneels and executes the unlock. However, register occasionally elevates beyond soldier idiom: "fulcrum of his intrigue," "dormant, secondary network woven into the fort's very soul" reads slightly literary for a sentinel's interior under blackout stress. Dialogue is absent; no test applies there. Voice remains character-particular without major slips.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Kael's mathematical and prophetic lens: "fractured timelines," "sacred patterns," "gallery of futures." Diction is controlled and purposeful, balancing technical specificity ("lead-lined pouch," "gravitational eddy") with lyric compression ("celestial river," "thimbleful of night"). No dialogue appears, appropriately given the solitary setting. Psychic distance tightens effectively at the climax when Kael pours the star dust, and the final paragraph modulates to quieter reflection without losing the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is elevated and metaphor-dense ("skull holding a single, stormlit thought," "cartography of scars," "rarefy the past"), creating a distinct poet's register. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the metaphoric density occasionally tips into overwriting: "vigil in pause," "storm-kissed wonder," and "rarefied" recur without always advancing pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The final beat's shift to plain embodiment ("hands that were finally, honestly trembling") contrasts effectively with the ornate earlier voice, marking the mask's dissolution. One filter-verb stack ("felt a kinship," "felt louder") in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices gears, angles, light refractions, and coded correspondences in a way that feels specific to his discipline. Diction remains controlled ("whirlwind of dignified chaos," "fluid syllogism executed in tempered steel") and matches the elevated register without jarring slips. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The prose texture is consistent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: "cathedral of decay," "vagrant penny poet," "sacred duty"—idiom fits Silas's learned, damaged lens. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: Elara's "Time to plant the garden" and the stranger's "Can… can we help?" both advance plot and carry subtext (complicity, hope). The final poem-reading modulates voice under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression ("their hands moving in a familiar rhythm") accelerates; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elian's perceptual signature consistent: he sees the world through a musician's lens, translating visual code into sonic key. The prose has distinct texture—"each note a drop of silvered sorrow"—and vocabulary fits the character. Psychic distance is controlled. However, "strategically creative" and "brute-force attack on the laws of this place" drift slightly into abstract register rather than staying grounded in Elian's immediate sensory frame, creating minor filter drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara filters the world through empirical metaphors ("meteorological data," "cartographer mapping") that erode under pressure. Diction remains character-bound, and the narrative voice modulates purposefully as her certainty shifts to faith. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess. The prose rhythm reflects her mental state—short, anxious beats during panic, flowing longer syntax during the song. Minor slip: "Her doubt remained, a soft and luminous glow" edges toward slightly elevated diction, though it remains within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Kenji notices ritual details (needle spacing, knot spirals) and filters setting through grief. Voice is stable, slightly elevated ("cerulean regret," "melancholic blue") but remains within the focalizer's contemplative register. No head-hopping. The single line of whispered dialogue ("When the tide turns…") advances plot by cueing the ritual. Psychic distance holds steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and plausibly situated in Leo’s experience: stunt jargon (“wire snaps”), sensory focus on physical risk, and a slightly heightened but not academic register.

The voice modulates under pressure, compressing into more immediate physical and tactical observations during decoding and confrontation without losing its textured interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly shaped by Kaelen’s sensibility (scientific-ritualistic, musical, slightly mystical). Diction and syntax are controlled; the rhythm flexes appropriately from long, meditative sentences to tighter beats under pressure. Metaphoric language is consistent with the established register and doesn’t break POV plausibility. The ceiling comes from occasional density of high-register abstractions that risk feeling like the author’s essay voice rather than entirely inseparable from Kaelen’s inner lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated diction that matches the surreal, introspective premise. Phrases like “periodically eternal” and “labyrinth of self” fit the speculative-philosophical register and the narrative doesn’t drift into incongruous tones.

    The third-person limited voice is controlled, fluent, and well-matched to a reflective, observational protagonist; diction like “temporal feedback” and “arrhythmia of the city” feels consistent with a precise, quasi-scientific sensibility. Psychic distance is steady, with smooth access to Elias’s understanding as it unfolds, and no head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a contemplative, mathematically minded conjurer, with controlled rhythm and a distinct perceptual bias toward pattern and structure.

Occasional broader pronouncements about “everyone who’d survived the wars” are still compatible with the chosen stance but slightly flatten the otherwise very particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice around Lyra is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits the material. Diction and rhythm feel purposeful, and psychic distance is handled well—zooming in on embodied sensations (pressure of the forces, shivering song) at key beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with subtle status dynamics (her declarative guardianship versus his humble statement of purpose). At moments the narration drifts toward a more omniscient, abstract register, but it doesn’t break focalization or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a meditative piece about ruins and recovery. Diction (“ocean-spray archivist,” “reactively visionary,” “liminal space”) feels controlled, not showy, and the narrator’s observational bias is consistent with Kaelen’s vocation. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the old woman’s rough, economical speech contrasting gently with the more elevated narration. Psychic distance is managed smoothly, with no head-hopping or register jolts.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with elevated but controlled diction that fits both Elias’s precision and the speculative frame. His perceptual focus on maps, geometry, and patterning gives the narration a distinct signature. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies, and the modulation from urban grit to numinous vault is handled smoothly. A touch of rhetorical flourish in places keeps it from feeling entirely effortless, but the control is solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably lyrical without becoming incoherent, and it tracks Elias’s perceptions in a character-plausible register. Diction choices like “bedrock facts” and “cataloging ghosts” give the voice texture and align with his worldview. Psychic distance remains stable and shifts gently closer under pressure, especially around the moment he almost throws the tile. A few abstracted phrases at the end flirt with generality, but overall the POV and voice are strong and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably elevated for a cosmic-scale story. Diction (“spatial mutiny,” “hole in the concept of ‘somewhere’”) gives the piece a distinct texture without becoming opaque. Psychic distance stays steady, with occasional reflective lines feeling anchored in Xylos’s perspective rather than authorial intrusion. There’s mild risk of over-uniform, lofty register, but it largely serves the tone rather than fights it.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with measured, often beautiful diction (“porcelain stillness,” “deathly vitality”) that feels motivated by Elara’s sensibility. POV is stable and controlled; we stay inside her worldview without leakage or gimmicky elision, and the narrative stance maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register. Rhythms vary well, and exposition about her father and the Ghost chemical is integrated into her present-tense focus. A few phrases lean toward authorial philosophy rather than strictly character-bound thought, but not enough to disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with an introspective, craft-obsessed protagonist. Diction like “cartographer,” “refract,” and “invented histories” feels natural for this mind and underwrites the conceptual frame. Rhythm varies well, with long, sinuous sentences in descriptive passages and slightly tightened cadence around the hum’s shift. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” tone undermining the intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive, marrying lyrical diction (“haunting the caesura between shipment and dispersal”) with concrete sensory anchors. The perceptual signature—sound-bent reality, colors assigned to emotions, and meticulous attention to industrial textures—feels inextricable from this specific erased, liminal consciousness. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated language is justified by the narrator’s disembodied, quasi-poetic state. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, flowing sentences in reflection and sharper beats around the ship’s horn and tide-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by Elias’s scientific yet romantic sensibility (“monotone prayer to physics,” “gloomy cheerfulness”). Diction stays plausibly within the register of a reflective, academically trained myth buster and never lapses into generic “literary” mush. Psychic distance is well managed, sliding closer at moments of sensory intensity without losing control. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyricism supports rather than muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person POV is steady and well-controlled, with Kael’s perceptual biases (reading crowds as flows, art as code) consistently shaping what’s noticed. The voice balances lyricism (“chaotic symphony,” “phatasmagoric beasts”) with clarity, and syntax modulates appropriately between descriptive calm and moments of tension. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Kael’s brief appeal to Zola carrying subtext about status and risk. There’s mild elevation in diction, but it aligns with the mythic, slightly fable-like framing and doesn’t break plausibility for his intelligence or role.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and suited to the lyrical SF tone, with a clear perceptual signature in how Kaelen notices light, cold, and tools. The narrative distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing edges toward poetic density but generally stays controlled and character-appropriate for someone steeped in both technical work and inherited ritual. The voice is strong and publishable, if not unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-modulated, with lyrical but controlled diction that fits both character and mood. Sensory focus skews toward sound and touch in ways that feel right for a blind protagonist, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. The prose moves fluidly between atmospheric description and technical action without head-hopping or register shocks. It’s strong and polished, even if it doesn’t push into truly idiosyncratic or riskier stylistic territory.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a dry, slightly wry register that matches an educated, world-weary professional: “a tin can of a place at the edge of the known one” and “a man who trusts the map, even when it’s not made of paper” are particularly strong. POV control is tight, no head-hopping, and exposition about his mentor and tools flows naturally through his perception. The rhythm varies well between long, lyrical sentences and shorter, grounded beats as pressure rises. A few phrasings skirt the edge of authorial rather than character-consciousness, but they largely feel plausible for his intellect.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a consistent mildly elevated register that suits the mythic tone. Diction and rhythm show deliberate craft without slipping into incoherence or mixed metaphor. Psychic distance remains stable; we stay with Elias’s perceptions even when the narration grows more abstract. While the voice is not radically idiosyncratic, it is polished and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and internally consistent for a reflective, highly trained explorer: terms like “capture matrix” sit naturally alongside “lonesome splendor.” Psychic distance tightens appropriately as the pressure spikes, with syntax shortening and sensations crowding in. There’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience; all knowledge is experiential or inferred in the moment. At times the diction edges toward elevated purple, but it mostly serves the character’s sensibility rather than fighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with a consistent gothic-lyric register that fits an introspective, somewhat self-dramatizing narrator. Diction like “copperlight repose,” “a rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea to the gray sky,” and “a trinity of deceit, locked in a single, unending second” feels unified rather than grab-bag ornamental. The POV’s knowledge and stance remain stable, and the retrospective framing (“The coast guard’s launch is a speck on the horizon now…”) is handled cleanly. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, slightly archaic lyricism that matches the gothic-fantastical material. Diction and rhythm show deliberate craft, especially in sentences like “Her love was a poison that nurtured; her sorrow a catalyst for dangerous beauty.” The narrative stance stays plausibly within Elian’s perceptual and conceptual range, even when inflecting toward the poetic. At times the prose risks over-luxuriance, but it remains legible and emotionally aligned rather than drifting into generic purple.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the mythic, elegiac tone; diction like “orchid solace” and “bone-white memories” feels patterned rather than random. Kaelen’s perceptual signature—attention to thread, texture, and the harbor’s ghost—anchors the lyricism, avoiding generic committee-voice. There’s no dialogue to test, but interior and description are well-integrated and the distance stays steady. At peak stress (storm run), some phrases remain more painterly than panicked, which slightly undercuts immediacy and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and lightly lyrical, with a distinct texture that matches Elara’s reflective, observant nature. Diction is controlled and appropriate to a literary register without sliding into academic or clinical tones, and the narrative distance is steady. The prose modulates gently with emotional beats—more expansive in description early, more focused and luminous around the sundial and final sunlight. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the quiet authority of the narration suits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and controlled, with a distinctive, slightly elevated diction that fits both character and world. Phrasing like “a ghost who gave other ghosts a name and a history” and “fragile timeframe, a breath held before a letter is mailed” shows rhythmic attention without tipping into confusion. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the modulation from interior to exterior is smooth, though the register is almost uniformly lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, consistent, and suits a reflective, slightly elevated SF tone. Diction and metaphor (stitching as cosmology and conspiracy, “ghost-stitch,” “silent symphony”) are coherent with Elara’s craft and worldview. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance is modulated smoothly between description and interior inference. The voice is strong but not yet unmistakably singular; an extra trace of idiosyncratic perception under peak pressure would move it into exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct texture (“air was as thick as an unsent letter’s ink”) and stable focalization through Elara, with only light omniscient touches that suit the mythic tone. Rhythm varies appropriately, slowing for incantatory description and tightening around the ritual’s climax. There’s no head-hopping, and the diction remains cohesive and character-appropriate for this quasi-mythic mode. The only limit is that Kael’s interiority is mostly inferred rather than directly voiced, which keeps his side of the voice slightly cooler.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person through Elias is steady and well-controlled, with a lucid, lyrical narrative voice that still feels anchored in his perceptions. Diction and rhythm are distinctive without slipping into mannerism; phrases like “lotus-hearted ache” are rare enough to feel intentional. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-rich, especially in Elias’s precise line to the General about thunder and quiet. Psychic distance modulates smoothly, tightening at key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensuous, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature that marries technical metaphors (exposed film, projector) to tactile and atmospheric detail. Diction and rhythm suit an introspective artist whose inner world is dense with imagery; the narrative distance remains steady, without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The voice modulates gently with pressure—becoming more precise and taut when the image wavers—without losing its lyric quality. It feels distinct and publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture, balancing technical vocabulary (“minor to a major key”) with sensuous description.

Sparse dialogue rings natural and serves to frame the fantastical interior without jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, somewhat lyrical texture that suits the speculative premise, with phrases like “daggers wrapped in silk” and “cathedral of glass and steam” signaling a controlled register. POV remains stably centered on Kaelen, with no head-hopping and a consistent narrative distance that allows both external action and interior shading. Dialogue between Kaelen and Aris carries clear goals (convince/warn) and efficiently advances plot while reflecting their differing temperaments. A few high-register constructions risk feeling writerly rather than strictly character-bound, but they don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident, consistent, and clearly tuned to Elara’s perception, with a strong preference for luminous, marine-cosmic imagery that feels unified rather than stitched. Phrases like “photosynthesize pain into beauty” and “reef-shadow joy” show distinctive diction and controlled rhythm, and the narrator never head-hops or over-explains. Psychic distance is well managed: we hover just outside her mind but with intimate access to her metaphoric logic. Some runs of elevated language risk slight sameness of cadence, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fantastical melancholy of the piece. Diction like “petrified air,” “museum of extinct feelings,” and “a breath that felt like it was drawn from the lungs of a thousand ghosts” creates a distinct perceptual signature that fits Elian’s role and the world. The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in register. At moments the lyricism approaches density, but it never fully tips into opacity or self-conscious flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated but character-appropriate diction for an arcane linguist (“grammatical vows,” “syntactical pledges”). Rhythm and syntax are varied and generally well-controlled, with lush description that supports the mood without losing clarity. Psychic distance stays stable, and we never slip into knowledge Kaelen couldn’t plausibly access. The near-absence of dialogue suits the scene’s magic-driven communication and avoids any clash between narration and spoken voice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in mechanical and geological metaphors (“geologic sighs,” “building breathed,” “pressure built within him”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled without drifting into generic lyricism, and there is no POV leakage. The modulation from analytic attention to quietly heightened emotion at the end is smooth. A few phrases (“a love so profound it ached”) brush up against the generic, keeping this just shy of an exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly lyrical texture that suits Elias’s inward, ritualistic mind and never drifts into generic omniscience. Perception is consistently filtered through his sensibility (dust as stars, pigeons as couriers of music), with no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but natural and understated, letting subtext (Anna’s nonjudgmental listening, his shifting stories) do work. Rhythm modulates well between meditative description and the storm’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction generally matches the slightly elevated, mythic tone of the piece without obvious register slips, aside from a few idiosyncratic word choices (“featherly determined”) that may feel mannered. POV is stable and doesn’t leak into other consciousnesses or omniscient explanation beyond what fits this stylized mode. Rhythm modulates effectively between lush description and tighter, decision-focused sentences around the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and appropriately colored by Kaelen’s sensibility—cosmic metaphors and a quiet reverence for systems and patterns. Dialogue is clean, distinct, and functional: Elara’s curt practicality contrasts with Kaelen’s more lyrical calm. The narrative rhythm modulates nicely, slowing for the wait and the spectacle without losing clarity. Occasionally the diction veers toward a somewhat generic “lyrical SF” register, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)

Psychic distance is steady and appropriate for a contemplative, ritual scene, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent with a contemplative craftsman; metaphors are mostly tied to light, glass, and water, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Phrases like “reads between the lines of the world’s quiet prose” and “noctilucent reckonings of a long, sleepless night” feel unified rather than ornamental, and the narrative distance stays stable. There’s no POV leakage or explanatory narrator overreach; reflection is anchored to present stimuli. The modulation from quiet unease to peaceful acceptance is subtle but clear, supporting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with controlled lyricism (“a slow dance of celestial bodies,” “peeling back layers of ash”) that suits the reflective mode. Diction and rhythm generally feel consistent with a literate but grounded narrative stance, and the occasional omniscient sweep still aligns with the piece’s contemplative tone. Dialogue is economical and natural, distinguishing Kaelen’s tentativeness from Elias’s gravelly certainty. A few high-register phrases flirt with authorial rather than character-driven language but don’t significantly disrupt POV integrity.

There’s minor risk of over-elevation, but it coheres as this character’s consciousness rather than a generic poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with elevated diction that fits a contemplative, mathematically devout astronomer and a mythic-historical setting. Sentences vary rhythmically and the narrative distance holds steady, letting us inhabit Kavi’s precise, almost liturgical attention.

    The third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with a strong conceptual lexicon suited to cosmic metaphysics. Psychic distance is stable and appropriate, giving us enough access to Elara’s perspective without slipping into omniscient explanation of Vale’s interior beyond what’s dramatized.

Diction balances elevated imagery with grounded, almost self-deprecating asides, giving the prose personality instead of generic purple. Psychic distance is generally well controlled; we stay in his head without unexplained omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)

The tone walks the “serious playfulness” line without sliding into preciousness, supporting both the craft-detail realism and the fable-like conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and distinctive, with a consistent lyricism and a clear perceptual signature in how it attends to silence, pressure, and space. Diction like “gilded hush,” “nascent starlight,” and “intangible tangible” feels coherent with Elian’s sensibility and the speculative frame. Psychic distance is well-managed, zooming into bodily detail under stress and widening at thematic moments without head-hopping or stance confusion. The risk is tending toward uniform lushness; a bit more rhythmic contrast between bunker anxiety and trellis expansiveness might sharpen the peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)

Word choice (“sonic architecture,” “Palimpsest Pillar,” “deeply futuristic nostalgia”) creates a distinct texture without drifting into an alienating academic or technobabble register. POV is stable with no leakage or unmotivated exposition; reflection on past aspirants is anchored in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled for both Elara and Liam, with a stable distance and clean, section-level POV shifts. Diction (“loaded emptiness,” “tender shadow keeper,” “tapestry of their shared pain”) is distinctive yet coherent with the story’s heightened, quasi-mythic register. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer, cadenced sentences for atmosphere and tighter lines around Liam’s breathing and jolt. The only minor constraint on an even higher score is that the elevated register occasionally feels more essayistic than perfectly character-bound, especially in abstract formulations of her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and confident, with a distinct texture balancing technical diction (“Quantum Promise,” “temporal anchors”) and sensory concreteness.

Rhythms modulate well between calmer description and high-pressure beats without slipping into authorial omniscience or head-hopping.

Psychic distance remains stable; we stay inside Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts. Overall, the voice feels unified and controlled, if slightly polished beyond what might feel entirely character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with elevated, lyrical diction that suits the mythic-fantastical frame. Word choice (“factually mystical,” “dissolution,” “charged poise” of objects) feels coherent rather than grab-bag, and psychic distance remains stable around Kaelen.

Distance control is steady; we remain close enough to her perceptions to feel embodied without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. While the voice is strong and polished, it reads within a recognizable speculative-literary register rather than as unmistakably singular.

    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, fable-like mode, with recurring turns of phrase that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction (“mossy delight,” “perpetual twilight,” “long, slow sigh”) gives the piece a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a meticulous, grieving alchemist; diction like “factually mystical science” feels idiosyncratic rather than generic. Sentence rhythm modulates well between long, incantatory lines and shorter, sharper beats at moments of strain.

POV remains stable and disciplined, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly elevated register that fits someone who lives “between worlds.” Diction and metaphors (“like smoke you could almost hold,” “bottled starlight or a whisper-thin map of a dream”) create a recognizable texture without slipping in and out of register. Psychic distance is steady and appropriate; we stay inside her perceptions without unmotivated omniscience or head-hopping. The voice is strong and pleasant rather than utterly distinctive, which keeps this in the low 8s.

    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, mixing technical vocabulary (“hoist cables,” “mainspring barrel”) with lyric phrasing in a way that feels true to Leo’s observant, slightly dreamy mind. The perceptual bias toward ceilings, machinery, and liminal sounds (buzz, silence, dripping water) gives the narration a clear signature.

There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, elegant, and appropriately elevated for an aging, poetically inclined revolutionary-scholar. Diction (“burnished sorrow,” “museum of a world”) carries a clear perceptual signature without slipping into incoherent register shifts. Rhythm varies well—long, baroque sentences for atmosphere, tighter ones around the shard’s activation—supporting emotional modulation. A few phrases edge close to purple, but they remain legible and character-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent with Elias’s sensibility as a meticulous artisan in a numinous world. Phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “symphony of cosmic repair” create a distinct texture without losing clarity.

Diction is elevated but coherent with a reflective, art-minded protagonist and the quasi-mythic material.

At times the voice leans toward polished lyricism over idiosyncratic character-specific turns, which softens its memorability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in its blend of technical (“lift engines,” “civil-rights archivist”) and sensuous, almost mystical description. Rhythm and diction modulate well between the cool hum of the zeppelin and the “searing” intensity of the lagoon without breaking POV plausibility. No head-hopping or stance drift appears, and the lyric register feels justified by Kaelen’s unusual experiences.

The perceptual signature—attuned to language, ritual, and the textures of death and remnant life—feels specific to this coachman-figure.

Metaphors like “nomadic penumbra” and “luminous absence” feel like extensions of her sensibility rather than authorial intrusion, and psychic distance is handled cleanly.

Rhythms vary well between dense, meditative interiority and lighter, expository lines, maintaining control under emotional pressure.

    The close third-person voice is supple and controlled, with diction that plausibly matches a thoughtful, academically trained rune scholar without drifting into sterile jargon. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively between long, meditative lines (fitting the held-breath frame) and tighter, tenser phrases as anxiety spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and character-appropriate, with a strong perceptual signature in how Kael experiences forces, fields, and pressures rather than solid objects. Lyric touches (“a constant, quiet wildfire,” “a symphony of pressures and vacuums”) feel largely integrated rather than grafted-on, and there’s no POV slippage. Rhythm varies and tightens appropriately around the button press and its aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly keyed to an observant, almost reverent archivist—technical terms like “ground gallnuts and iron salts” sit naturally beside metaphorical turns like “soft, bruised evening.” Psychic distance is managed well, allowing both sensory immediacy and reflective framing without confusion. Dialogue, though brief, feels natural and carries subtext (Tomas’s “Something… shifted” and “It was about them” efficiently compress awe and realization). A few lines flirt with purple prose, but rhythm and diction remain controlled enough to preserve clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a dry, slightly wry lyricism that matches Silas’s temperament (“a joke that landed with the soft thud of moss on brick”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative distance stays steady, slipping closer for key interior beats without wobble. Dialogue is sparse but natural and in-character, especially the self-deprecating humor. The voice is distinctive enough for publication, though not yet so singular as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and tuned to Kaelen’s unusual sensorium, with recurring textures like “quiet blaze” giving the piece a recognizable signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and generally well-matched to a meditative, high-concept interior journey. There’s no POV leakage or explanatory “helper narrator” tone. A few phrases lean toward familiar lyric shorthand (“days that bled into one another”), which slightly dilutes the otherwise distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-matched to a technically literate, self-exiled scientist, with diction that feels both precise and slightly elevated. The narrative maintains clear focalization without head-hopping, and moments of abstraction (“professional posture one of being confidently uncertain”) stay anchored in concrete context. Rhythm varies nicely between dense conceptual passages and more spacious emotional beats. There’s minimal register drift, though a few lines approach essayistic reflection rather than fully dramatized thought.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently handled, with a distinct texture in the diction around silence, music, and light. Lyra’s brief whisper-dialogue fits the tonal register and doesn’t disrupt focalization, reading as an internalized presence. Rhythm varies appropriately, lingering on key images and tightening during the climactic hand-sign sequence. The elevated language is consistent with the quasi-mystical frame and does not feel like generic “poetic” prose.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility, with a good balance between concrete observation and reflective metaphor. Diction like “necropolis of forgotten knowledge” and “quiet, enduring fire in the dark” gives the prose a distinct texture without becoming opaque. Occasional phrases verge on generic or writerly (“resolve as hard as diamond”), but they don’t break POV or register. Psychic distance stays steady and there is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinct, with a lyrical yet controlled texture that fits Elara’s sensibility. Diction and imagery stay coherent across the piece, modulating into more heightened rhythm as her drumming and emotion intensify. There’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; the narration’s certainties track what she can plausibly infer or feel. The lyric register is elevated but consistent enough that it reads as character-appropriate rather than authorially imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident and textured, with strong control over rhythm and diction (“the color of a poisoned bruise,” “a thing of creases so deep they held their own shadows”). POV is stable, and Kaelen’s dialogue feels distinct and in-character, contrasting Silas’s understated speech. The narrative idiom is slightly elevated but plausibly aligned with Silas’s perceptual intelligence. Overall, voice is a major strength, just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and mostly well-matched to a close-third vantage, with clean control of distance and no head-hopping beyond a light, acceptable slide into Elara’s sensations. Dialogue sounds natural yet elevated enough to fit the mythic-tinged tone, and the two speakers have distinct idioms—Kaelen dreamy and abstract, Elara grounded and blunt. Diction and rhythm are varied and purposeful, especially around the cove and the island’s ascent. The voice feels unified and specific to this world rather than generic fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture, deftly balancing lyricism with clarity. Elias’s theatrical narration of his actions, then the deliberate refusal to narrate the whittling, and finally the flatness of the last line demonstrate fine control of modulation and psychic distance. Diction and rhythm feel consistent with his mind—heightened but not implausibly ornate. The voice is memorable and coherent under pressure without slipping into authorial intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly keyed to a poet’s perception—metaphors like “lantern-moth hush” and “sheet of polished bone” feel character-specific rather than generic. Narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in register. The prose modulates gently as he moves deeper into immersion without losing clarity or becoming syntactically muddled. A few phrases edge into abstract conceptuality (“language of pure structure”) but do not disrupt the overall voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a lyrical but not overwrought texture that matches the fable-like, post-apocalyptic tone. Perception is clearly tethered to Elian—especially in the grayscale/colorblind details—while still allowing occasional broader descriptive flourishes that feel consistent. Dialogue is sparse but natural and in-character, particularly Vex’s exhausted “A perfect sound in this broken world? It’s impossible.” The psychic distance stays stable and the rhythm modulates well toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, with rhythmic variation and a recognizable narrative texture. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the descriptive density feels deliberate rather than mechanically patterned. While the voice is more broadly lyrical than deeply idiosyncratic to Elian, it still reads as a coherent, confident narrative presence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Elias’s sensibility as a craftsman and mourner, with strong metaphoric texture tied to metal and stars. Psychic distance is controlled; we move smoothly between his perception and a lightly external narrator without jarring head-hops, and the brief dialogue at the end sounds natural and restrained. Some diction (“infinitely layered curtains of intention,” “subdued ardor”) leans toward the elevated and conceptual but remains coherent with the mythic-tinged setting. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent, with recurring cadences (“pure and potent,” “exquisite, unbearable clarity”) that suit the tone. POV is stable and focused on Elara’s perceptions; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the register verges on abstract-philosophical, but it remains plausible for this character and doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and aligned with Kael’s sensibility as a curator of memories; diction and imagery feel plausibly filtered through him. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, ornate sentences in reflective description and tighter ones around key choices (“He placed the river stone...”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance remains controlled. A few elevated metaphors flirt with abstraction but do not break the coherency of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elias notices tools, bodies, and light. Diction choices like “grace of falling leaves” and “quietly vivid turquoise and jade” are consistent with the established tone and POV distance. There is some mild expository explanation of theme, but it doesn’t break stance or create head-hopping. Overall, the voice feels distinct and controlled enough for a competitive literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture—“meteor hush,” “returning geography,” “psychic soil and rock”—that feels unified with Elias’s sensibility. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent, with rhythmic variation that supports the contemplative, slightly uncanny mood. Interior focus and perceptual bias stay locked to Elias without leakage or unmotivated register jumps. The lyric mode is confident enough that even dense metaphors remain legible rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains consistent: metaphors tied to cinema, time, and sound (“a specific frequency of absence,” “hushed thunder”) feel like a genuine perceptual signature rather than generic ornament. POV control is clean—no head-hopping despite the shift into Arthur, which is clearly mediated through Elara’s psychometry. Rhythm and sentence length vary appropriately with intensity, giving the prose a confident, readable flow. The only hedge against an even higher score is that the high lyric register is unvarying; there’s little modulation into plainer diction that might sharpen key emotional beats by contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, sound, and celestial metaphor that fits both character and premise. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction feels appropriate for a solitary mystic rather than imposed. There is no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience; even the large-scale metaphysics are filtered as her realization. A few phrases push toward generalized poetic register, but they do not fracture the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctly textured, comfortably handling both technical language (“wave functions”) and lyric metaphor (“a repository of might-have-beens and never-weres”) without register clash. The diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—more expansive and descriptive early, tightening around the disturbance and integration process. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified jumps in knowledge. While the voice doesn’t take extreme risks, it feels assured and particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)

Dialogue is spare but natural for archetypal guides, and the narrative stance does not over-explain itself.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical texture that matches Elias’s background as a singer and his contemplative state. Diction like “seraphically mundane” and “secret cathedral” feels specific to his sensibility rather than generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)

Psychic distance stays steady, leaning slightly omniscient but never head-hopping, and the narration’s certainty matches what this mode can plausibly know. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no POV slips or cheap withholdings. The only limiter is that the voice, while polished, feels more like a polished genre-narrator than something uniquely idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)

Maritime and rhythmic metaphors are consistent with his world and don’t break POV plausibility. The narrative distance tightens effectively around key beats (the alarm, the failed attempt, the symbol revelation) without head-hopping or stance wobble. It’s distinctive and controlled, if not quite idiosyncratic enough to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and imagery (“frozen lightning,” “thunderous serenity,” “constellation of ghosts”) give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity or over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara attends to plants, heat, and mineral detail. Elevated diction feels appropriate to the quasi-sacral tone of the ritual and the “prestige SF” register rather than imposed from outside the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, moving smoothly between sensory detail and interior reflection without head-hopping. Diction like “somatic markers” and “cataclysms” pushes toward a more analytical register but mostly fits a character who has clearly worked to understand her own body’s responses. Rhythm modulates well: longer, textured sentences in calm moments compress into sharper beats under peak stress. There’s a recognizable perceptual signature centered on touch, sound, and weight that makes the narration feel individual rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)

Phrases like “a remembered pain against his chalk-pale skin” and “a way to walk the seams of the world” feel of a piece, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. POV boundaries are clean and there’s no unmotivated head-hopping or register lurches.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with the narration’s elevated, slightly solemn diction matching both Elara’s role and the story’s tone. The voice has a consistent texture—measured, image-rich, and inclined to metaphor about archives, machines, and snow—without slipping into omniscient commentary.

Rhythms vary nicely between long, flowing descriptive sentences and tighter beats around the knife decision.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confidently lyric, with a consistent register that matches the cosmic, surreal premise: phrases like “feral lullaby” and “shape of a held breath” feel of a piece. Third-person focus stays tight on Kaelen’s experience, and the narrative doesn’t drift into unjustified omniscience about other entities’ inner lives. Rhythm and syntax are varied and generally purposeful, modulating well between lush description and more focused action. While the diction verges on ornate, it remains coherent rather than muddled, supporting rather than eclipsing the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with an elegant rhythm that suits Celeste’s introspective, analytical nature. Phrasing like “orbits of regret” and “tiny, constant satellites of sorrow” gives the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Dialogue is clean and functional; Celeste’s speech carries a slightly playful precision that matches her stated tone, while the journalist sounds more conventional. There is some mild register elevation, but it remains plausible for an educated heiress in a heightened literary frame.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a lyrical but controlled register that matches Elian’s sensibility as a constellation tattooist.

Occasional elevated diction never feels alien to the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)

Phrases like “a mission to cradle empathy in arms of steel” and “his voice a study in warm coldness” give a distinct tonal signature without becoming opaque. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the few lines (“It doesn’t have to hurt anymore”; “My name is Ren”) carry clear subtext and structural weight. There’s occasional abstract phrasing, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with Julian’s synesthetic perception giving the prose a distinct texture (“sound like sparkling cider,” “color of rust and despair”). POV is stably centered on Julian, with only mild omniscience in describing Elara’s sensations, which feels tonally appropriate to a ghostly observer embedded in time. Rhythm and diction are well modulated: elevated but not stiff, and suitably theatrical for a former actor-narrator. The voice feels unified and confident, even if it doesn’t push into radically distinctive experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s mix of technical focus and tender doubt. Diction is elevated but still believable for this character, and interiority is folded smoothly into narration.

Psychic distance is modulated effectively at key beats (clicking the shutter, seeing the images) without any head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a measured, lucid lyricism (“a precise science in a world that had become factually mystical”) that fits both Elara’s vocation and the story’s speculative tone.

The prose modulates appropriately as pressure rises, shifting from observational to more immersive and rhythmic during the merger without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without becoming opaque, and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s particular obsessions (time, choice, small objects). Diction and rhythm modulate well between atmospheric description and conceptual exposition. The narrative stance feels confident and stable; there’s no POV leakage or awkward register shifts. A few abstract formulations (“a knot of tangled history he had to unscramble”) are slightly more essay-like than character-bound but do not seriously disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—sensory, slightly lyrical, and inflected by a spy’s tactical awareness (“a sound deliberately made,” watching movement in the pillbox reflection). Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext about mistrust and old loyalties without over-explaining. The lyricism rarely drifts into abstraction, and psychic distance is modulated appropriately, tightening around peak beats (the revelation “She’s alive?” and the final decision). There’s no head-hopping or register clash, and the narration’s elevated diction fits the reflective, high-stakes mood.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)

Phrases like “spindrift serenity” and “soupy white of the fog” feel of a piece with the overall register and do not break psychic distance. The prose modulates well, with longer, more complex sentences in reflective stretches and a crispness to key beats (“A single, clear bell tone echoed across the water”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—“moved with the quiet deliberation of water finding its level,” “the sun bled out”—that feels consistent with Kaelen’s contemplative perspective. Diction and rhythm modulate well with pressure; sentences lengthen for atmosphere and compress around key actions without losing clarity.

The voice is memorable and confident enough for high-level markets.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly colored by Elara’s perceptual biases (gardening metaphors, tool-specific detail, the way she measures silence). Rhythm modulates well: longer, flowing sentences for atmosphere and slightly tighter phrasing around the physical act of lowering and rocking the line. Diction is elevated but still believable for this character’s interiority, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The recurring metaphors (oars, heartbeat, seed of light) feel like extensions of her worldview rather than authorial imposition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and confident, with elevated diction that suits the mythic, cosmic setting. Kael’s perceptions—ghosts, extinct wings, nebula-bound codices—form a consistent perceptual signature, and the modulation from awe to fear to calm is controlled. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the temporal framing around the reincarnation memory is clear. While strong, the voice is more classically lyrical than uniquely idiosyncratic, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elara’s perception—dense with metaphor yet controlled. Diction and rhythm suit a reflective, language-attuned character (a ghostwriter), and the “prismatic” motif in particular feels like a genuine perceptual signature rather than generic ornament. There is no head-hopping and no dialogue to test, so POV management remains clean. A few abstractions in the last lines lean more toward authorial thesis than character-embedded noticing, but they do not seriously disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct texture that blends technical diction (“carrier wave,” “subsonic frequencies,” “waveform generator”) and lyrical turns (“dusty bubble of analog warmth,” “cosmic tricksters, bored immortals”). Psychic distance is steady, and interior access feels plausible for a scientifically literate but not emotionally over-articulate protagonist. There is no dialogue to test speech distinction, but the narrative idiom remains consistent and character-inflected, especially in how she frames the cosmos as both battlefield and playground for others. While the voice is polished and pleasurable, its rhythm and risks stop short of being truly idiosyncratic or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suitably elevated, with a consistent lexicon that matches the story’s gothic-cosmic atmosphere. Sentences modulate rhythm between long, descriptive lines and sharper, stress-appropriate beats. Some diction edges toward purple or generalized horror phrasing (“panic, cold and sharp, lanced through him”), but clarity and focalization remain intact. It’s strong, but not yet distinctive enough in rhythm or idiom to feel unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctively attentive to visual and textural details, befitting an artist narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)

Overall, the voice feels distinct and controlled without calling excessive attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyric texture that suits Elias’s artistic sensibility. Diction and syntax are controlled and patterned without becoming opaque; images like “pixelated amnesty” and “luminous disbelief” feel like extensions of the same sensibility rather than grafted-on cleverness. While the language is elevated for a “simple fiddler,” his poetic perception makes this plausible rather than jarring. The modulation from dazed observation to charged, almost incantatory focus at the end is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility; diction like “quiet, dusky harmony” and “polished calm” feels character-appropriate rather than generic purple. Sentence rhythm is varied and confident, with descriptive density that mostly enhances mood without obscuring action. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially Elias’s line about property as story, which carries subtext without over-explanation. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies; the narrative distance is well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Elian’s occupation and temperament, giving the narrative a coherent perceptual signature. Lyricism is controlled—images like “glowing ideograms” and “message in a bottle cast into an ocean of time” extend the core conceit rather than float free. Psychic distance remains stable, and the narration doesn’t overreach what Elian can plausibly infer. The register is occasionally a touch general at emotional peaks, but not enough to disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits a disciplined, ritual-practicing druid in a high-fantasy setting. Sensory focus on land, magic, and emotional resonance feels character-specific, and the narrative does not leak into omniscient knowledge outside her perception. Rhythm varies with pressure: more compressed, blade-like phrasing in the vortex sequence, more expansive in setup and coda. A few abstractions (“warlike serenity,” “form of sympathetic excavation”) slightly smooth the otherwise strong, embodied perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lush, mythic-science-fantasy lexicon that matches the world and Elara’s visionary status. Diction choices (“root-bound visionary,” “lightning frozen on skin,” “raw dream-stuff”) give the prose a recognizable texture without slipping into incoherent ornament. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay inside Elara’s perceptions even when the narration briefly zooms out conceptually. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from anxious tension to a more buoyant, shared elation at the end feels like a deliberate vocal shift rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Aris-colored, with a strong perceptual signature (earth, light, bones, and emotional weight intertwined in almost every line). Syntax and rhythm vary well, with lyric density that generally serves mood without clouding causality, and the diction feels apt for a thoughtful, self-lacerating protagonist. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the few direct quotes are clean and purposeful rather than expository. The lyricism occasionally hovers near overrich, but it stays controlled enough not to blur key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Elias’s, with strong occupational lexicon (“Mid-90s Marshall, salt-and-pepper basketweave,” “appraiser’s loupe”). Rhythm varies well between longer reflective sentences and tighter, concrete action, and there’s no POV leakage. The controlled, slightly wry narrative stance (“a master of the material world but a novice in the geography of his own heart”) suits both character and subject. A slight tendency toward polished, essay-like turns of phrase in a few lines edges away from rawness, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, blending scientific and mythic registers in a way that suits Elara’s character as scholar and experimenter.

Rhythm varies well between long, meditative sentences and tighter action lines, especially around the planting and the final reveal.

Sentences modulate length and rhythm effectively, thickening around peak images like “light, thick as honey” without losing clarity. The perceptual signature—attuned to resonance, texture, and emotional undercurrents—feels unified with Elias’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and texturally distinctive, with phrases like “the river’s memory” and “a broken lung that could still…breathe a fractured tune” giving it a clear sensibility. Narrative distance is well-controlled, slipping between external description and interior stakes smoothly. At times the diction drifts toward essayistic abstraction that feels a hair more like the author than Elias. Even so, the voice remains coherent and apt for a literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and coherent, with an elegant, mildly archaic texture that matches the surreal setting. Diction like “archive of echoes” and “cathedral of his regret” feels unified rather than stitched, and POV access never wobbles. Rhythm varies effectively between longer, lyrical sentences and shorter, decisive beats at climactic moments. At times the register leans toward ornate, which risks distancing us slightly from her raw feeling, but it remains within believable bounds for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet coherent with Elias’s educated, sensitive perspective. Diction (“provenance,” “cellular memory,” “mulberry ache”) feels like his, and the prose modulates well between sensory description, interior conflict, and conceptual reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)

Psychic distance stays stable; we remain close enough to Elara’s perception without head-hopping or stance confusion. Some constructions are familiar for speculative-literary prose, but the overall voice feels coherent and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinct, and consistent: a practiced, slightly jaded operator who still believes in the product he sells. Diction like “sincerely insincere,” “protected vulnerability,” and “cloak of doubt” feels like this narrator’s lexicon rather than generic philosophizing. Dialogue sounds natural yet charged, advancing both pressure and theme without expository clunk. Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified narrator omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that feels suited to speculative literary fiction. Kael’s perceptions and the narration’s metaphors align plausibly, and psychic distance is well managed, zooming in during the trance and softening at the end.

The voice isn’t radically idiosyncratic, but it’s confident and polished enough for competitive markets.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, consistent, and well-matched to a meditative, mythic tone. Diction and imagery feel specific to this world and to Kaelan’s attunement to sound and pattern, giving the narrative a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well-controlled, with smooth modulation between atmospheric description and close interiority. It doesn’t quite reach the very top tier only because the voice, while strong, rarely surprises in rhythm or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits both the character and the hybrid techno-fantasy world. Phrases like “a poet forced to write legal code” and “a magic so old it had forgotten its own name” show a distinct perceptual signature rather than generic description. Distance is well-managed; we’re close enough to Kael’s thoughts for emotional access without slipping into omniscient commentary. There’s minimal exposition-for-its-own-sake, and the lyrical register never fully detaches from Kael’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture, with controlled metaphors (“a phantom preceding the light he carried,” “meteor hush”) that suit Silas’s introspective, haunted perspective. Psychic distance is steady and apt, letting technical detail (gauges, oxygen mix) live alongside more numinous language without feeling like register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a cosmic, centuries-old reaper’s sensibility. Lexicon and imagery (“shoreless sea,” “silent apocalypse of dying stars”) feel native to this consciousness rather than imposed. Rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences and sharper beats at key moments (“He did not feel healed, for a reaper cannot heal”). At times the diction approaches ornate, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a controlled, lyrical tilt (“a missing note in the symphony of the world”) that stays consistent and character-aligned. The narrative distance modulates well—broad, cosmological framing at the start, then narrowing to tactile adjustments of streams and drips at the climax. Diction is elevated but not incongruous for the quasi-mythic, contemplative mode, and there’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience beyond the chosen register. A few phrases edge toward generalized elegy, but overall the perceptual signature is distinct and steady.

POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and reflective passages stay clearly anchored in present stimuli. Rhythmic variation and sentence-level modulation match the piece’s quiet, accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and confident, with a distinct, gently elevated voice that fits a solitary, technically adept watcher. Diction and rhythm (“midnight pattern seeker,” “silent scream across the system”) feel purposeful without drifting into florid excess.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the contemplative SF-mystic setting, with lines like “his face a mask of serene disapproval” and “his mind a similar collection of disconnected particles.” Kael’s interiority feels distinctively numb yet observant, while Jin’s dialogue carries a different rhythm and register, making status dynamics legible. There’s some mild abstraction (“profound emotional numbness,” “core tenet”) but it doesn’t drift into clinical or corporate jargon, and the narrative distance remains stable. Overall, the prose perspective feels controlled and character-grounded.

There are no jarring POV slips or register breaks that would undercut the emotional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyric-analytic texture (“a long, slow act of interiorizing exteriors”) that feels plausibly tied to this feral yet reflective guardian. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentence patterns modulating between slow, weighty description and sharper beats at moments of intrusion or decision. POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping, no unwarranted omniscience beyond Lyel’s perceptions. A few abstract formulations slightly smooth his otherwise idiosyncratic perceptual signature, but overall voice is a strength.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias (technical, poetic, cosmically attuned) that matches Elara’s profession and obsession. Lexicon like “structured, meaningful silence” and “coiled spring of reality” feels stylistically of a piece with the world and character. There’s good modulation between lush description and clearer technical beats as she adjusts the system. Occasionally the register skirts the edge of grandiosity, but it doesn’t fracture POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a confident descriptive register that suits an observant but grounded protagonist. Finn’s perceptual signature—attuned to mechanical details and patterns—is consistent and feeds both atmosphere and plot. Elevated turns of phrase (“a place that clearly didn't trade in normal currency,” “permanent transient”) generally feel intentional rather than over-written. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from uncanny awe to quiet aftermath reads controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a distinct lexicon (“realistically imaginary,” “rational enchantment,” “consensus that could be renegotiated”) that matches Elias’s conceptual, architect-like mind. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well—more fevered as pressure rises, then slow and heavy at the end. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narration stays plausibly within what this character would notice and think. The voice balances lyricism with clarity, rarely slipping into generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, with a distinct, mildly elevated diction that fits a thoughtful, technically-minded instructor in a high-concept SF setting. Word choice around navigation and physics (“edge geometry,” “cosmic shorelines,” “unfolded horizons”) builds a consistent perceptual signature. There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble; the narrative distance is steady and apt for a reflective, concept-driven piece. A bit of rhetorical flourish in the council speech feels slightly writerly rather than entirely character-idiosyncratic, but it doesn’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice through Elias is steady, with elevated but controlled diction that matches the quasi-mystical job. Prose rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and quieter, plainer dialogue, and there’s no head-hopping. Elias’s narrative texture feels distinct from Leo’s brief, more direct speech, which grounds the scene. The register is slightly lofty in places but remains coherent with the story’s aesthetic and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is textural, rhythmic, and mostly well controlled, with strong sensory bias toward sound and pressure that suits the setting. The prose occasionally slips into a slightly more abstract register (“my duty to stand by the unremembered”) but not enough to break coherence. One minor wobble is the brief first-person possessive (“my grandmother”) embedded within a third-person Elias frame, which may read as a perspective stitch rather than a deliberate hybrid. Overall, the voice is distinct and confident, though not yet at the level of unmistakable, singular idiolect.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close-third voice is steady, lucid, and lyrically inclined without losing clarity, with a clear perceptual signature in Elara’s attention to rhythm, silence, and pattern. Scientific and metaphysical registers blend smoothly enough for this character and setting, avoiding jarring register shifts. Syntax and rhythm vary, with longer, lush sentences in reflective passages and tighter ones at key beats, like the ink’s sudden coalescence. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shifts, and the absence of dialogue feels intentional rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, balancing mythic diction (“towers of bone,” “tunnel of echoes”) with precise sensory and conceptual detail. POV distance stays steady and believable: we inhabit a mind that thinks in metaphors without slipping into authorial essaying. Rhythm modulates well at the climax, with the abrupt “Silence.” providing a sharp tonal and syntactic pivot that feels earned. There’s no dialogue to test, but narrative voice alone carries strong character and tonal cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, texturally distinct, and consistent, blending precise observation with an almost deadpan cosmic irony that suits the concept (“the world that made so much and so little sense”). Diction and metaphor feel plausibly Julian’s while also carrying literary weight, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Rhythm varies well across description, reflection, and the climactic choice, with no intrusive exposition or “helpful narrator” handholding. The only arguable limitation is that the polish occasionally flirts with sounding slightly more authorial than character-bound, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that suits Elara’s sensibility and the fable-like world. Sentences modulate rhythm effectively between quiet experimentation and the orchard’s upheaval. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence fits the quasi-mythic tone. While not radically distinctive, the perceptual signature (attention to sound, texture, and subtle magic) feels unified and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical yet controlled texture (“artform of negatives,” “twilight bled across the sky”) that suits the speculative premise and Elias’s contemplative stance. POV boundaries are clean, and free-indirect moments stay within what Elias can plausibly perceive. At times the diction feels a notch more ornate than the character’s professional identity might suggest, leaning toward authorial lyricism over strictly character-bound idiom, but the pattern is coherent and does not break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a solitary craftsman in a liminal, enchanted space. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional, with a clear perceptual signature centered on material detail, light, and sound.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits a librarian obsessed with geometry and narrative (“topological anomaly,” “manifold”). The perceptual signature—attention to books as tools, geometric language for space, and sensory shifts at the moment of contact—is distinctive and coherent. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the lyricism modulates appropriately as pressure rises. A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it from absolute razor-edged control, but it’s clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is stable and confident, with a distinct rhythm and lexicon that fit a solitary, ritual-obsessed librarian in a quasi-mythic setting. Diction (“whispering archipelago,” “luminous absence,” “cipher of longing”) is elevated but consistent and never breaks POV plausibility for this fable-like mode. Psychic distance tightens effectively at key beats—the foggy sunrise, the sacred-feeling development, the manifestation—without head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is memorable and controlled enough for publication at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, confident, and consistently lyrical, with a clear mythic-fable stance. Diction like “ley lines of memory and starlight” and “improbable longing” gives it a distinct texture without obvious register slips.

The modulation toward a quieter, almost hushed tone at the ending supports the sense of earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s profession and temperament, with a clear perceptual signature (constellations, folklore, tools). Diction and rhythm are varied and purposeful, especially in transitions from procedural detail to numinous experience. Limited dialogue is used precisely and powerfully in the remembered line from his mother, sharpening the emotional spike. The voice is strong rather than utterly distinctive at a sentence-rhythm level, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is assured, with a controlled, lyrical third-person that stays close to Elara while allowing textured observations about Kael. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, and Kael’s dialogue (“Resilience is not the absence of knots”) reads as distinct and in-character. There’s no confusing head-hopping; any brief interpretive moves about Kael’s motives are plausibly Elara’s inferences. The voice’s elevated register fits the mythic-quiet tone, though a bit more modulation in sentence rhythm during peak pressure could heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with controlled rhythm and consistent diction that suits the mythic-fantasy register. The perceptual filter stays with Elian and rarely leaks, and the prose modulates appropriately for the key ritual moment. That said, the voice feels more like an elegant narrative overlay than a deeply particularized consciousness; many phrasings (“latent energy,” “ultimate purpose”) could belong to any similar fantasy vignette. There is craft here, but limited distinctiveness of Elian’s individual mental texture.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct idiom (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) that feels native to this character’s contemplative, ritual-focused mind. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent, and the sensory selection (light, cold, brine) shows a coherent perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare but functional and natural, distinguishing Kaelen’s uncertainty from the narrator’s authority. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and psychic distance stays appropriately close to the narrator throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is assured, with a consistent perceptual bias toward texture, tools, and time-bound artifacts befitting a map framer and archivist. Syntax and rhythm vary well, mixing longer meditative sentences with shorter, charged ones (“The henge wasn’t just a monument. It was a container.”) for emphasis. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage; the narrative confidence matches what Elara can plausibly infer. The lyric register is elevated but believable for this character and never lapses into abstract jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is steady, intelligent, and distinctively clinical without being bloodless, with touches like naming her familiar with death “Mortimer.” Technical and philosophical language (“fold spacetime,” “pocket universe,” “conservation of momentum”) fits her education and mindset, maintaining register consistency. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both observational precision and moments of quiet, subjective reflection. A slightly wider modulation of rhythm under peak beats could further sharpen emotional undercurrents, but as is, the POV control is strong and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct idiom (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert calm”) that feels suited to a balladeer in a liminal tech-mystic world. Psychic distance stays steady, gliding between external action and interior texture without confusion or head-hopping. At times the diction edges toward ornate, but it remains coherent with the chosen mode and maintains clarity. Rhythm modulates nicely between slower, descriptive beats and the more compressed, tense interlude around the thunder strike.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and colored by Kael’s temperament, with a measured, slightly lyrical tone that fits the contemplative arc. The prose modulates well—more compressed and schematic when he puts on the goggles, more expansive in the reflection around the sketch and the final walk into the Archives. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what’s already clear in the images. It could push a hair further into idiosyncratic diction to reach a more unmistakable personal signature, but it’s already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyric, and clearly colored by Elias’s technical and emotional relationship to the sky (e.g., “fear was a low-altitude emotion,” “a library of echoes”). Diction and syntax feel unified and controlled, with a measured cadence that suits the contemplative, high-atmosphere frame. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance holds steady at a close, reflective remove. The risk is a slight uniformity of register—nearly every line is elevated—which is graceful but leaves little modulation between beats.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without being opaque, and tightly filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities (touch, pattern, light). Diction and syntax are controlled and modulate well with pressure, moving from expansive description to more focused beats as the machinery returns. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; psychic distance is managed cleanly. It’s distinctive and polished, if not yet singular enough in rhythm or idiom to feel absolutely unmistakable.

    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, with lyrical but grounded diction that matches Elias’s mix of technical focus and wonder.

The register feels unified—no sudden academic or corporate intrusions break the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture—metaphors like “water-smoothed wood” and “liquid shadow” clearly belong to the same sensibility. Psychic distance stays controlled; we never leave Elara’s frame, and the narration’s certainty matches what she can perceive. Rhythm and syntax modulate with the scene, slowing for description and tightening around key actions without confusion. A few phrases edge toward workshop-poetic, which slightly dilutes the otherwise distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled and mostly close to Elara while occasionally sliding into an omniscient summary register for the ghost’s motives. Diction is apt for the genre and consistent, with some memorable lines (“a perfect image of the brambled hope that defined their lives”) but not yet a fully distinctive signature. POV drift is mild rather than confusing, though the explicit explanation of the ghost’s backstory and intent flattens what could have been left partially in subtext. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character, if not especially textured.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s sensibility—laced with melancholy, reverence for his task, and sensory specificity.

    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and textured, with a distinctive lexicon (“blighted orchard of stone and gears,” “subsonic frequency… sang to the stone but screamed at the birds”). Narrative distance tightens appropriately around the assembly and release moments without head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm and syntax are varied, handling both lyric description and procedural action smoothly. The voice feels character-anchored rather than generically “fancy,” which keeps the lyricism grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly Aris’s, marrying scientific diction (“organic surfactants,” “polymerization”) with lyric perception in a way that feels character-true. His way of noticing is highly selective and biased by his profession, giving the narrative a strong perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between sensory description and interior reflection without head-hopping or stance confusion. The register remains coherent; there are no jarring slips into authorial commentary outside what suits this educated, analytic character.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinctive lyrical texture that fits Elian’s contemplative, metaphysical quest. Diction is elevated but coherent and consistent (“cartography of the void,” “path of least resonance”), and the narrative distance holds a cool, slightly formal tone that matches the conceptual focus. The perceptual signature—attention to absence, silence, negative space—is strong and carries through the whole piece. There’s minimal risk of POV leakage or register clash, and the modulation from quiet observation to charged act is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility as a chef attuned to taste and sorrow (“voice a shovel scraping rock,” “smelling of wet stone and bruised creosote”). Diction is elevated but consistently supports the mythic, melancholic tone and never drifts into mismatched registers. POV boundaries are respected; we infer the Warlord’s state entirely through Kaelen’s perceptions and touch. Rhythm modulates well, with long, image-rich sentences in reflective beats and tighter, more direct phrasing around key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technical language (“int main() { std::cout <<”) and musical/ritual diction. POV remains stable and modest; we never slip into knowledge Elias couldn’t have, and distance modulation tracks the scene’s intensity. Sentence rhythm and lexis feel deliberate and consistent with this particular character and world. The mix of code, hymnal phrasing, and gentle description never fractures into disparate registers.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a lyrical, slightly baroque register that fits Elara’s “helix-minded” cognition and the speculative premise. Diction choices like “chaotically precise” and “quaking reverie” create a recognizable texture without slipping into multiple conflicting registers. POV boundaries are stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the narrative distance tightens effectively around key sensory and emotional beats. At times the lyricism nears the edge of purple, but it mostly serves atmosphere and character rather than obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits a specialized, cerebral protagonist and a numinous setting. The voice has a recognizable texture in phrases like “library of echoes and shadows” and “prism-mind,” and distance tightens appropriately during the escape. There are minor slips—an obvious typo (“clandestineyl”) and occasional phrasing that feels more narratorial than character-bound—but they don’t materially disrupt coherence or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s musical and tactile orientation (“a fabric without a thread of song,” “a map of its resonant soul”). Diction and figurative language match the character’s obsessions and the story’s tone without straying into academic or anachronistic register. Psychic distance remains stable and apt, moving fluidly between close sensory detail and slightly wider lyric commentary. The only reason this doesn’t cross into the absolute top band is that the rhythm, while strong, doesn’t take as many risks in modulation under peak beats as the very best work in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a cerebral, reflective protagonist; diction like “correlate,” “resonant frequency,” and chess terminology fits his mind. The prose’s rhythm modulates appropriately, slowing for perception and quickening subtly as the phase begins, without head-hopping or stance slippage. Description and interiority are interwoven cleanly, and the conceptual turns remain legible. A few phrases lean toward generalized lyricism, but the overall perceptual signature remains distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent with Elias’s sensibility, with synesthetic perceptions and refined metaphor giving it a distinct texture. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay anchored in his perceptions and lexicon without head-hopping or register drift. The narrative modulation from anticipatory hush to triumphant quiet satisfaction is smooth and controlled. There is a mild risk of over-poeticization in places, but it remains legible and voice-motivated rather than ornamental for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly filtered through an olfactory consciousness; smell, not sight, dominates in a way that feels character-specific. Syntax varies between long, meditative sentences and tighter clauses at moments of pressure, with good rhythmic control. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance remains stable and intimate without drifting into essayistic exposition. Occasionally, the register edges toward overtly abstract formulations, but it never fully breaks character plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically inclined without becoming opaque, with phrases like “whirling silence” and “a liquid road that snaked through the hanging monoliths” giving it a distinct texture. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay inside Elara’s sensory stream and tactical focus. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative stance matches what she could plausibly perceive. Rhythm varies with the scene’s intensity, tightening during the cavern and release on return to the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and well-matched to a technical yet haunted investigator: phrases like “echoes of impossibilities” and “cathedral of stillness” show a distinct perceptual idiom. The blend of scientific lexicon and lyric description feels cohesive rather than stitched together. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and modulation from procedural to elegiac in the final paragraphs is smooth. While not explosively idiosyncratic, the voice is strong and confident enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrically elevated, and consistent, with a distinct sensibility that fuses physical and sensory metaphors (“a presence, a sculpted hush that had form and weight”). Synesthetic perception shapes the narrative idiom in a way that feels specific to Kael, not generic high fantasy. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance is managed smoothly, hovering in a mythic-close mode that suits the concept. At times the register skirts uniform grandiosity, but it remains coherent and confident rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and convincingly anchored in Kaelen’s sensibility. Metaphors like “cathedral of silent, waiting stone” and “thread of gold… like a captured sliver of sun” have texture and fit the elevated tone. A few coinages (e.g., “avalanchingly quiet pressure”) flirt with self-consciousness, but they don’t break the voice or POV control. Overall, the rhythm and diction feel deliberate and controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends cosmic and mechanical imagery. Small modulations—Elias adopting Anya’s cadence, then dropping it—are handled cleanly and support character rather than confuse POV. Diction is elevated but coherent with the mythic/scientific milieu. It’s very strong, though a hair more differentiation in Anya’s internal texture (beyond “dizzying shock”) could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured lyricism that fits Kael’s anxious but observant mind. Diction like “relic courier,” “ridgeway,” and “across the fade from memory to myth” feels of a piece with the world and character. The narrative filters setting through his emotional state (e.g., the aurora as an “ethereal, exposed stage”), maintaining a coherent psychic distance. There is no dialogue to test, but interiority and description modulate rhythm effectively around the central event.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated lexicon appropriate to a mystic who behaves like a scientist. Diction and rhythm support the solemn, ritualistic mood without drifting into opaque abstraction. Phrases like “shifted hush” and “truthful lie” feel like native idiom rather than grafted ornament. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies, and the modulation under peak pressure (as the image resolves) is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent cadence and lexicon that feel native to this character and world. Metaphors like “a place swallowed by a rustling bamboo forest” and “time’s unraveling tapestry” reinforce both theme and mood without breaking point-of-view plausibility. The narrative distance is well controlled, tightening around key actions (removing the bead, weaving the final threads). There’s no dialogue to test, but the interior and descriptive voice are distinct and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the mythic-quiet tone of the piece. Diction like “coax resilience from rubble” and “captured twilight” feels unified rather than patchwork, and interiority is folded smoothly into description. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register lurches, and the narrative distance is stable. The voice is strong but not so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel singular at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with controlled, mildly lyrical diction that suits a methodical, sensory-focused protagonist. The way Kael notices the world—through smells, frequencies, structural hums—gives him a distinct perceptual signature. At a few peaks the narration edges toward generic SF-poetic phrasing (“fundamental instability of existence itself”), but generally the register stays aligned with both character and genre.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a gentle, melancholic lyricism that matches Silas’s temperament and the maritime setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative remains plausibly within his perceptual and conceptual range without drifting into abstract or clinical language. The ghost story touch (“The ghost was just loneliness after all”) is folded into his worldview smoothly, avoiding jarring register shifts. It doesn’t quite reach the most singular, unmistakable voice tier, but it is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that suits the baroque cosmic setting. Diction like “symphony of chaos” and “cathedral of light and shadow” coheres tonally with Kaelan’s grandiosity. At times the register skews toward purple, but it rarely muddies meaning or breaks POV plausibility in this mythic frame. A bit more modulation—letting some plain, sharp lines cut through the lushness—would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and plausibly belongs to a meticulous artisan attuned to color and light. Lexicon and imagery remain coherent with Kaelen’s sensibility, and the narrative distance is stable and controlled.

Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive passages and tighter procedural lines, preserving legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory and emotional register, with lyrical but controlled diction (“a melody bloomed in her mind, a simple, four-note phrase that felt like the color yellow”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from sounding mechanical, and the lyric register fits the fable-like, fantastical tone. At times, the narration edges toward generalized fantasy-poetic language (“mirror world,” “perpetual twilight”) rather than an utterly singular perceptual signature, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility; metaphors arise from his concerns (books, stars, storms, alchemy). The narrative distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between physical detail and interior reflection without head-hopping or stance slips. Rhythm and diction feel deliberate and confident, with sentences modulating in length to fit mood and not lapsing into generic register. The voice feels particular rather than interchangeable, supporting both atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, sensorially dense, and clearly keyed to Elara’s perceptions and lexicon, while dialogue voices are distinct (Silas’s rasping bravado, Boro’s blunt authority, Eva’s clipped disdain). Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with descriptive flourishes matched to moments of relative stillness and tighter phrasing during exchanges. POV remains stable and modest in its claims; we infer others’ emotions through behavior rather than authorial assertion. It’s strong, stylish work that could edge even higher with slightly more modulation in sentence complexity at peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct blend of scientific lexicon (“emergent compass,” “atmospheric pressure”) and lyric sensibility (“terrestrially cosmic energy”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled and suited to a thoughtful, empirically minded protagonist experiencing something borderline mystical. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance is consistent. At peak moments the register leans a touch toward polished essayistic cadence, which slightly blunts immediacy but not clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)

Diction and rhythm are deliberate—phrases like “sea of permanent clouds” and “color of wonder” build a distinct texture without major register clashes. POV distance remains stable; we stay in Elian’s sensory and conceptual frame without head-hopping. Modulation under pressure (during the crescendo) is handled largely through intensified imagery rather than syntactic experimentation, which works but leaves some dynamic range unused.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctively mechanical-lyric: technical diction (“geothermal regulators,” “core processes”) fused with sensuous, metaphor-rich perception (“air smells of ozone and lost things”). POV control is tight, with no leakage beyond what this caretaker could plausibly infer, and psychic distance narrows effectively under stress. Rhythmic variation and image choice support the mounting pressure but remain legible. A few metaphor-dense lines flirt with purple, though they largely stay anchored in the character’s perceptual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, gently lyrical, and consistent, with nice touches like “a point of sandstorm calm in the swirling anxiety” and “a desire not to solve a puzzle, but to mend a tear.” Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate, giving us Elias’s worldview without head-hopping. Dialogue snippets are brief but natural and character-appropriate: Mrs. Petrov’s “reedy hum,” Mateo’s puffed-up pride, and Mr. Chen’s practical recollection all feel distinct. Occasionally the narration leans into thesis-like phrasing, but overall rhythm and diction are well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature in its fusion of technical and poetic diction (“lyrical code breaker,” “part-constellation, part-equation”).

Rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and sharper, compressed beats during the memory retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinct, with a controlled, lyrical register (“terrestrially cosmic,” “architecture of fate”) that suits the contemplative magic. POV boundaries are stable; we never leave Elara’s sensibility, and the diction aligns with a character attuned to cosmic and terrestrial nuance. At times the lyricism trends toward uniform cadence and abstraction, slightly flattening dynamic range. Nonetheless, the voice feels intentional and confidently managed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice centered on Clara is stable, with a clear perceptual signature in her architectural metaphors and attention to material details.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, blending lyrical description with interiority in a consistent register. Diction (“velvet garden,” “captured starlight,” “quarantined memory”) creates a distinct perceptual signature that fits the speculative-mooded frame.

The elevated, occasionally abstract phrasing is consistent but could risk slight sameness of texture at times.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“treason of semantics,” “comma of liberation”) that feels consistent with Kaelen’s obsessive, scholarly temperament. Diction and rhythm are confident and modulate well: more ornate in atmospheric openings, tighter around the key act. There is no POV slippage or explanatory hand-holding; exposition about the glyph and oath is woven into his focused perception. The only small limitation is that the elevated register is nearly uniform—an intentional choice, but it leaves little contrast between emotional peaks and quieter beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)

POV is stable, with no leakage or unwarranted omniscience, and the narrative distance modulates subtly as he moves from parapet distance into embodied immersion. Rhythms are well-controlled, balancing long, sinuous descriptive sentences with shorter, weight-bearing beats at key moments (the whistle, the fireflies’ non-response, the final tool image). The lyricism is strong enough for high-level venues while remaining legible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)

Sentences modulate rhythm effectively between wide-angle description (“stained-glass mosaic”) and compressed, intense interior focus during the resonance-matching sequence. The perceptual signature—attuned to sound, vibration, and mechanical detail—feels specific to this character and job. A few phrases border on grandiose, but they fit the established stylistic register rather than breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and textured, with elevated but coherent diction that matches the quasi-mystical technical setting. Her perceptual signature—attentive to horizons, weather effects, instruments, and celestial mechanics—is consistent and character-anchored. Rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences and shorter emphatic beats at moments like the click of the switch or the hum’s cessation. It doesn’t quite reach the most distinctive tier because the tonal register changes little under peak stress and occasionally leans on familiar constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person POV is steady and convincing, with a diction level that fits a meticulous investigator while still allowing evocative phrasing. Elias’s perceptual bias—attention to marks, angles, waterlines, professional framing of “preventable death”—gives the voice a clear signature. Psychic distance is well modulated, with the prose tightening around the uncanny jolts and relaxing into more reflective description as he interprets them. A few abstract phrases (“residual consciousness,” “entangled memories were a concept for poets”) flirt with analytic register, but generally remain in character.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending technical language (“non-Euclidean configuration”) with wry, character-specific turns of phrase (“beautiful disaster,” “afraid to pray”). POV discipline is solid; we stay in Kaelen’s head without leaks, and the narration’s elevated diction feels like an extension of his speculative, quasi-philosophical mindset. Rhythm modulates well between slower, reflective description and tighter, propulsive action during the test. A hair more syntactic variation in a few descriptive stretches could push the musicality even higher, but the voice is already distinctive and controlled.

    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, slightly lyrical tech-inflected texture (“digital gloom,” “echo of forgotten songs”) that suits Elara’s focus. Kael’s dialogue is brief but effective, carrying status dynamics and subtext (his casual tone vs ominous presence in a forbidden sector). Exposition is generally well-woven into the narrative voice rather than feeling like info-dumps. The prose doesn’t take extreme rhythmic risks, but its modulation under pressure is smooth and never confuses POV or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is mostly steady through Kael, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits the quasi-mythic setting. Interior access is clear without head-hopping, and the narrative sounds confident about only what Kael could reasonably infer or see (augmented by his established magic). Dialogue is spare but functional and natural, revealing shock, fear, and relief without speechifying. Some abstract formulations (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “courageous anomaly”) sit at the edge of being too authorial, but they don’t significantly disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, close, and textured with a distinct sensibility—lyrical but not omniscient, clearly anchored in Elara’s perceptions and metaphors. Diction (“euthanasia tourist,” “windborne solace,” “charged poise” of the ice) feels consistent with an introspective, somewhat detached protagonist. Psychic distance stays under control, and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. Modulation toward the end—sentences stretching and softening with the ice’s sigh—supports the emotional beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and textured, with a strong sensory and metaphorical signature rooted in Elias’s relationship to the land. Rhythm and syntax support the reflective, autumnal mood, and psychic distance is handled confidently. The one notable register slip—the academic phrasing of “quiet effort to nurture intersubjective understanding”—sits awkwardly in what otherwise feels like a vintner’s embodied consciousness. Aside from that, the voice is distinct, confident, and well-sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated yet controlled diction that fits both the quasi-mystical world and Kael’s disciplined mindset. Phrases like “loom of sound,” “whisperfield calm,” and “pocket of stabilized thought-space” create a distinct texture without sliding into jargon soup. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; distance tightens appropriately around ritual and loosens for description. A slight uniform serenity of tone during high-stakes moments keeps the voice from fully exploiting rhythmic and emotional range.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to an elderly scholar—elevated diction feels earned by the character. Sentences vary rhythmically, with nice textural touches like “a solid tear for a silent age” that feel organic rather than showy.

There’s a distinct perceptual signature—bookish, reverent, precise—that holds through the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong sensory bias toward texture and sound that feels tied to Silas’s obsession. Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, sustaining a contemplative, slightly mystical register without obvious register slips or head-hopping. The focalization stays tight—metaphors and perceptions all plausibly belong to someone who lives among rust and dead technology and chases echoes. Occasionally the narrative leans toward generalized “poetic” phrasing rather than absolutely idiosyncratic Silas-specific idiom, which keeps it just shy of truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice around Elias is steady and confident, with lyrical but controlled diction that suits an aging, meticulous craftsman in a fantastical-scientific setting. Prose modulation under pressure works: sentences tighten and sharpen as the vibrations peak and the window cracks, but the voice never breaks register. Dialogue is sparse yet functional and in-character, especially Hima’s concise exposition of the problem. There’s a mild omniscient sheen in some lines, but it doesn’t undercut focalization or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, gently elevated lyricism that matches Elara’s temperament as a contemplative star-watcher. Diction (“zephyr bloom,” “serpentine grotto,” “reflectively vibrant”) is ornate but consistent and plausibly aligned with a character steeped in celestial imagery and gem-treatise language. Psychic distance stays controlled, slipping smoothly between external action and interior reflection without head-hopping or expository over-explaining. Rhythm modulates well between meditative, longer sentences for polishing and slightly sharper focus at the twilight-beam turn.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature in Elara’s metaphor choices (moss as fragile biome, judgments as roar inside silence). Lyrical diction generally matches the contemplative, slightly heightened register of the piece; free indirect touches stay within what she could plausibly perceive and infer. Dialogue is spare but functional and subtextual, particularly in the pendant exchange where much is carried by gesture and implication rather than speech. There’s minor risk of the narration feeling a bit more ornate than Elara herself, but it doesn’t break POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly elevated lyric texture that matches Elias’s sensibility as a novelist. Diction and imagery are controlled and consistent (“whisper of closing pages,” “swirling hush”), and the psychic distance narrows appropriately at peak beats without head-hopping. There’s no dialogue to test, but interiority and narrative stance align smoothly. The voice maintains clarity despite its lushness, avoiding showy opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, slightly lyrical, and filtered through Elian’s tinkerer sensibility (“puzzled together like a broken gear train”), giving the narration a consistent perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a good balance of concrete and elevated language, and POV discipline is clean. The voice is polished but not yet distinctive enough in its idiosyncrasy to stand out at the very highest editorial level.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, with a distinct texture (“liquid luminescence… celestial river”) that suits a mythic, ritualized frame. Psychic distance is stable: we stay close enough to Kaelen’s perceptions without slipping into omniscient explanation of others. Diction and rhythm modulate well with the ritual’s beats, giving the starlight pour and final ignition appropriate weight. There is no head-hopping or register-break that undermines the established stance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrically inclined, and consistent with a reflective, almost ceremonial mood; diction such as “harvest of echoes” and “cellar of reason” feels unified rather than patched. POV distance is steady, hovering in close limited without intrusive authorial commentary or head-hopping. The narrative cadence modulates appropriately—slowing for contemplative observation, then tightening around the reconstruction and activation. Overall, the voice has a distinct texture that supports the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is coherent, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct diction (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) that suits the speculative, devotional tone. POV is stable and never leaks; the narration’s certainty matches what such a quasi-mythic consciousness could plausibly know. Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling droning despite its meditative mode. A few phrases flirt with ornament for its own sake, but they do not break voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“hauntingly practical,” “calm thunder,” “crystallized time”) that feels native to Elara’s mind. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and sharp sensory beats (the whistle, the first cut) without losing clarity. Reflection and present action are interleaved cleanly, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The lyrical register is elevated but controlled, matching the character’s introspective, craftsmanlike temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyric-but-controlled register that matches Kael’s reflective, haunted state. Diction choices like “kinetic lagoon,” “temporal anchor,” and “audio-sieve” feel unified within the speculative frame and character worldview. Occasional more abstract phrases (“primary action in this stilled world”) brush against essayistic, but they remain in character and do not break psychic distance. Dialogue is sparse yet effective, clearly distinguishing the ghost’s defensive logic from Kael’s harder-won clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, mildly lyrical engineering sensibility, comfortable with both schematics and metaphor (“a labyrinth of secondary conduits,” “a circuit waiting to be completed”). Diction is consistent with an intelligent, technically minded but poetic focalizer, and the narrative distance remains stable. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between procedural description (wiring generators) and wonder (the galaxy outside view), with no POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and clearly filtered through Elias’s contemplative, ascetic sensibility. Lexicon and syntax support a meditative, almost monastic register that matches his long immersion in silence and ritual. Rhythms modulate effectively between long, lush sentences and briefer, grounding beats at key turns (opening the coffer, placing the bells). A slight tendency toward uniformly elevated diction skirts preciousness but doesn’t break plausibility for this POV.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct textural feel: tactile, slightly poetic, attentive to tools and structures in a way that suits an “errant legend seeker” from an architectural family. Diction (“architecture of lies,” “load-bearing falsehood”) is elevated but coherent with the story’s conceptual frame and does not break POV plausibility. Rhythm varies nicely between long, atmospheric sentences and tighter action lines, and interior access is clean. There’s minimal risk of committee-voice flattening, though one or two abstractions could be trimmed to let the images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature oriented toward texture, pattern, and liminality. Diction like “a single pier bleached pale,” “a fisherman’s rope, stiff with salt and age,” and “petrified lightning” feels unified and character-appropriate for a contemplative, quasi-mystical collector. There’s good modulation between lush descriptive sentences and crisper explanatory phrases that keep the piece legible. No head-hopping or stance slippage undermines the POV, and the narrative distance is well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)

The narrative distance is steady, and the description of the projection (“a crimson haze,” “wool-and-incense smell”) feels anchored in Kaelen’s way of noticing. There’s some high-register diction, but it matches the elevated, reflective mode and doesn’t slip into explanatory omniscience. Overall, the voice feels distinct and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lush, and well-matched to a prince in a decaying, baroque sky-palace; diction like “filigree,” “Grand Orrery,” and “quaking reverie” feels intentional rather than random. The perceptual filter remains closely tied to Kaelen’s obsessions, continually framing machinery and decay against his yearning for life. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and shifts in intensity (from descriptive calm to the breath-held hatching scene) are well managed. On occasion the elevated register risks tipping into ornament, but it never breaks POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct texture in its metaphors (“ghost ship on a glassy sea,” “kelp-drift peace”) that feels unified with Elara’s sensibility. Third-person limited focus stays stable, with interiority and description tightly interwoven and no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates appropriately—denser and sharper around the fire, more spacious around the lagoon—without slipping into monotony or self-conscious ornament. Diction remains consistent and character-plausible, even at its most elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism that reads as aligned with Elara’s analytic yet imaginative mind. Diction choices (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush,” “realistically imaginative”) create a recognizable perceptual signature without slipping into academic or showy register. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving smoothly between external action and interior conceptual framing without head-hopping or confusion. The modulation from cool, logical observation to tremor at the moment of proof is particularly well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close-ish cosmic voice is consistent, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm that feel suited to an “otherworldly sentimentalist.” Diction choices like “quiet sigh of falling petals” and “ephemeral form” establish a clear perceptual signature. There is no POV slippage and the narrative distance is stably elevated, modulating slightly at beats of realization without breaking frame. At times the abstraction flattens immediacy, but this feels like a calibrated stylistic choice rather than a loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a disciplined lyricism that suits a meditative craftsman and stays within a plausible register for him. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the prose modulates from hushed to storm-pressed without losing control.

There’s minimal exposition and no POV leakage, keeping the narrative stance confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits an aging, meticulous craftsman engaged in quasi-religious work. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between the more mechanical tower beats and the more lyrical ridge reverie without losing coherence. Interior access is consistent and free of head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. A few phrases verge on essayistic (“ethically diligent nature”), but overall the voice feels unified and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., chess-clock metaphor, “velveteen gloom,” attention to tools and threads). Diction is elevated but plausibly aligned with the narrative stance and Elias’s contemplative habit of mind; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm modulates well between long, textured sentences and sharper turns at key beats (the silver thread, the pulse of the case). A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it from feeling razor-precise under pressure, but it remains highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-matched to a reflective, analytical protagonist: elevated but not alienating, with metaphors tied to his cartographic and probabilistic mindset. POV boundaries are clean, with no unjustified omniscience or head-hopping, and psychic distance tightens appropriately as he approaches the decision. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, culminating in more compressed, image-driven lines around the quill and final descent of the nib. On occasion, phrases lean toward abstract register (“careful orchestration of change”), but they remain plausible for this character and do not undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly shaped by Elias’s sensibility (musical and reverent, with attention to light and texture). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a confident, slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like tone. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” drift. The main ceiling is that the voice, while beautiful, stays at a similar pitch of lushness throughout, with little modulation under notional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not overwrought texture that matches the gallery’s ritualistic solemnity. Diction like “curator of endings” and “serene compassion” feels native to Elara’s interior world, and the occasional broader statement (e.g., “the grief would find its way back in”) reads as her seasoned belief rather than authorial intrusion. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though the narration sometimes glides toward an omniscient, essayistic cadence that slightly smooths over rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with elevated diction that suits a self-taught rationalist living amid ruins. Silas’s narrative texture (“muck and memory,” “disciplined, mathematical pursuit of place and time”) feels distinct from the girl’s simple, frightened speech, giving clear voice distinction. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping in and out of reflection without losing spatial or emotional orientation. Occasional expository phrasing flattens the otherwise strong voice just enough to keep this shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice around Elias is stable, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits his reflective temperament and the quasi-sacred feel of choral work.

The perceptual signature—attuned to craft, silence, and breath—feels distinct rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close POV is steady, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in taste and craft metaphors. The narrative voice is lyrically elevated but mostly compatible with Elias’s sensibility as an intuitive, metaphor-driven chef. Phrases like “guided synaptic plasticity” and “sculpting a mind made of root and leaf” briefly drift toward academic or essayistic register, which feels slightly at odds with his “informal wisdom.” Overall, though, the voice is controlled, recognizable, and consistent in distance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a consistent, slightly elevated lyricism that suits the speculative setting and thematic ambitions. Silas’s perception colors much of the narration, and Lena’s presence does not cause head-hopping or distance confusion. Dialogue is clean, economical, and purpose-driven, with subtext (her reliance on his “affliction,” his refusal to simply hand over facts) carrying weight. Occasional explanatory sentences feel more authorial than character-filtered, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is a controlled, lyrical close third, with a strong perceptual signature—phrases like “student of creeping normality” and “a fashionable contagion” feel idiosyncratically hers. Diction and rhythm are consistent, modulating smoothly from lush description to slightly more declarative reflection at the epiphany. There’s a touch of authorial polish in abstract phrases (“encroaching void,” “conceptual repricing” implied) but it largely fits the reflective, observant character. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person POV on Mara is stable, with Galen’s telepathy handled cleanly via italics and distinct diction, avoiding head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, confident, and tonally coherent, with elevated diction that suits the metaphysical setting and mathematically inclined protagonist. Phrasing such as “prodding a sleeping god with a compass and a ruler” reflects a distinct perceptual angle and rhythm without tipping into opacity. Psychic distance stays stable: we’re close enough to track his logic and feeling, but not so deep that the narration contradicts his perspective. While polished, the voice leans a bit toward a generalized “literary” register rather than something unmistakably idiosyncratic to Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that matches Elias’s sensibility as an artist. Phrases like “saffron quiet” and “a glass bubble of humid, clean air” feel character-filtered rather than imposed. Distance is managed well; we stay in his perceptions and doubts without head-hopping or expository intrusion. The lyricism is rich but not so idiosyncratic that it risks opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lightly lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a cultured former museum guide—phrases like “rosewater dread” and “entombed in memory” feel motivated by his sensibility. Narrative distance is well controlled, dipping into his perceptions and thoughts without head-hopping, and modulating rhythm effectively between exposition, memory, and the climactic song. Dialogue is sparse but natural and economically reveals status and worldview (“The mountain has claimed the river”). At moments the narration edges toward omniscient-lyric commentary, but it never breaks plausibility for this focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with controlled, slightly baroque diction that suits a meticulous, metaphysically-obsessed craftsman. Sensory choices (ozone, cold brass, “pale ghost in the polished brass casing”) carry a distinct texture and maintain consistent distance. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative stance stays stable and interior access is coherent with no head-hopping or unjustified register shifts. Occasionally the narrative slides toward authorial abstraction (“the ghost of potential that haunted all matter”), but it still feels compatible with Elias’s worldview rather than generic essaying.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture: lush but not incoherent, with phrases like “silken scrape” and “ghosts of sugar and rust” establishing a consistent gothic-psychic sensibility. Interior perception is tightly bound to his altered state (afterimages, luminance), which keeps POV grounded even in high abstraction. Dialogue from Fear and the advisor matches the established tone while remaining distinguishable. A few explanatory lines near the end tilt briefly into expository register, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and sensorially lush, with a distinct musical-physical lexicon (“orchestra,” “concerto,” “primary node of his fractal”).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, almost ceremonial cadence that fits both Aris’s profession and the solemn stakes. Dialogue is purposeful and distinct—Elara’s brief, guarded statements contrast with Aris’s structured, argumentative lines. Occasional generalized commentary (“People felt the hollowness, even if they didn’t know its source”) tilts toward essayistic, but it still plausibly reads as Aris’s analytic framing. The modulation from descriptive quiet to intense, low-voiced argument is smooth and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is tightly controlled and distinct, blending technical grounding (“firm shore surveyor,” “foundation repairs”) with lyrical metaphor in a consistent register that plausibly reflects Elias’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well managed, sliding closer in the panic of the inkwell’s loss and then easing back into reflective cadence in the hut. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction choices (“interlaced absence,” “quiet, unshakeable purpose”) feel of a piece with the overall tone. The voice enhances rather than competes with the content.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s professional sensibility. Diction (e.g., “tranquilly perceptive,” “cartouche,” “provenance,” “maker’s mark”) suits both the world and character.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, blending technical vocabulary with lyric metaphor in a way that feels like Amal’s particular mind.

There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice maintains its texture under pressure without drifting into generic sci-fi exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)

Phrasings like “brilliant dimness,” “font of pure meaning,” and “perpetually surprised look” give the prose a recognizable texture without sliding into self-parody. Psychic distance is stable; we remain inside Elara’s perceptions and inferences without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm varies enough to keep the scene fluid, and the lyricism mostly supports rather than obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elias’s haunted interiority (“a sound like sandpaper on bone,” “panning for a feeling”). Diction stays coherent and mostly avoids register clashes, and the narrative distance is well-controlled—intimate but not confessional. There’s effective modulation from more atmospheric opening lines to the sharper, colder articulation of his new purpose at the end. Occasionally the elevated lyricism risks feeling authorial rather than fully character-inflected, which keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close POV is steady, confident, and well-matched to Elias’s reflective, professional sensibility. Diction is elevated but not ostentatious, with lines like “space between apology and forgiveness” and “furrowed hush” creating a distinct, controlled texture. Dialogue is sparse yet functional and aligned with the ceremony’s severity. The voice could risk a slightly sharper edge or idiosyncrasy under peak stress, but as-is it is polished and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture, marrying nautical and astronomical diction with a weary, self-lacerating lyricism (“the stars had become a cartography of his failure”). Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping between sensory immediacy and reflective metaphor without losing the scene’s present tense pressure. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty matches what Elias can plausibly infer. The elevated language feels character-appropriate rather than generically “poetic,” though a few abstract formulations brush the edge of essayistic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a cool, slightly clinical diction that matches a man recovering from an empathy-wiping procedure yet capable of sensory noticing. Cadence is varied and the narrative distance tightens effectively around key beats (the cavern reveal, the letter) without head-hopping or stance confusion. The “jaded wonder” tone is maintained without excess melodrama, and elevated language feels organic to the speculative-literary mode.

Psychic distance is well-controlled, weaving Elian’s interiority into the descriptive fabric without head-hopping or confusing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct sensibility (cartomancer, ink, stars) shaping word choice and metaphor. The narrative distance stays tight enough to feel like Elara’s mind while still allowing elegant sentence-level turns. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from suffocating awe to calm resolve is smooth. At times the voice leans toward high-register lyricism across multiple sentences in a row, but it remains coherent and purposeful rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, assured, and lyrically restrained, with a consistent register that suits the character and premise. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative doesn’t slip into omniscient knowledge outside what the frame reasonably allows. The prose modulates with pressure—more compressed and tactile when she’s overwhelmed, more spacious when she floats—without losing coherence. There’s a slight tendency toward elevated conceptual phrasing, but it feels like an intentional stylistic choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent—elevated, sensory-rich, and tuned to Kael’s contemplative mindset. Phrasing like “philanthropist of moments” and “the world’s quiet suggestions” gives the narration a distinct perceptual signature without drifting into opaque abstraction. Narrative distance stays stable; we are inside his priorities without head-hopping or unearned omniscience beyond the mild, mythic framing of the legend.

Kael’s perceptions—mathematical sigils, patterns, aurora as “borrowed dawn”—create a distinct perceptual signature.

Diction like “rarefy the past” and “storm-kissed wonder” fits his sensibility and the story’s tone without breaking plausibility. The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance, sliding closer at key beats (the timer ping, the flash revealing the face) without head-hopping or unmotivated abstraction. Lyricism is high-density but controlled; it rarely trips over into muddle or self-conscious ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with elevated but coherent diction that fits a “dueling philosopher” and maintains a consistent, slightly ornate register. Phrases like “a silent monument of patience” and “a whirlwind of dignified chaos” give the prose a distinct texture without slipping into full purple; the narrative distance feels stable.

    The close third-person voice filtered through Silas is confident and lyrically textured without losing clarity, and the “penny poet” sensibility is evident in metaphor choice and attention to language. POV remains stable and grounded; reflection is anchored in concrete cues (the prison library, personas) and always feeds back into current choices. Dialogue is spare but effective, with Elara’s grounded tone contrasting Silas’s more poetic register and advancing the scene’s stakes. Rhythm modulates well between lush description and plainer, purposeful lines at moments of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but distanced, favoring a "told" legendary quality over immediate immersion. While stable, the tone summarizes emotional states ("felt the drain") instead of allowing them to disrupt the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward the melodramatic and overwrought ("cold iron ligament," "symphony of security"). The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to Elara's perception, but the elevated tone sometimes clashes with the tactile grit of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic interiority ("earthquake in my soul," "violent, powerful certainty") that feels unearned. The narration occasionally slips into "as you know" exposition to establish the backstory quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a high poetic register that suits the subject matter. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw") creates a layer of distance that buffers the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a disciplined mechanical remove that makes the intrusion of the human memory feel genuinely alien and profound. The perspective shift at the climax is handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent gothic tone appropriate for the genre, though it lacks a unique perceptual signature. The point of view is stable, but the reliance on familiar genre phrasings dampens the distinctness of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident and atmospherically consistent, blending technical terminology with elevated emotion. A few phrases ("auroral sorrow," "indigestible stone") teeter on the edge of purple prose, but the specific register generally supports the "oracle" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is generally atmospheric but slips into expository "telling" that creates distance ("I, a firm and religiously skeptical man"). The narrative stance wavers between immediate immersion and retrospective explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, carrying a weary, elevated tone that fits a timeless chronicler without becoming stiff. The shift in rhythm from the frantic library to the slow river effectively mirrors the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is consistent and the therapeutic voice is sustained, but the tone often veers into sentimentality. The narrative distance collapses in moments of emotional summary, telling the reader exactly how to feel about the grief rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)

    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching Alistair's intellectual approach to exorcism. The control of distance is stable, keeping us firmly in Alistair's perception. The voice falters slightly only in the didactic nature of the final dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is stable and maintains a consistent, slightly melancholic tone. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("He believed," "He saw") that creates unnecessary distance in high-emotion beats.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a "roadside poet." However, the reliance on filter verbs ("He believed," "Elias knew") creates an unnecessary layer of mediation between the reader and the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyricism that suits the "muted age" atmosphere. There is a distinct perceptual signature in how sound is described, though the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("magnificent simplicity") rather than staying grounded in the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, perfectly suiting the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice relies on filtered perception ("Elias felt," "He saw") and explicit emotional labeling ("cautious exuberance," "stunned, radiant gratitude") instead of embodied experience. Dialogue is functional but stiff, serving primarily to deliver exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, relying on poetic phrasing ("luminescent ache") that borders on sentimental. The use of filter verbs ("he realized," "he knew") distances the reader from the character's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the melancholic tone, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory telling ("This was how his particular insight worked").

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic fable-like quality that suits the subject matter well. The third-person limited perspective is stable, though it occasionally dips into expository knowingness rather than strictly filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a high, slightly academic register that fits the "collector" archetype. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("hurricane inside me," "shrieked at me") that feels less controlled than the surrounding narration. The focus remains tight on the protagonist's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is generally distinct and atmospheric, but a significant POV slip in the second paragraph ("thread this labyrinth with your own story") breaks the first-person frame. This unmotivated shift in address disrupts the otherwise consistent narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is generally atmospheric but suffers from tonal clashes, specifically the modern/cinematic "cameo appearances" within a gothic fantasy setting. The narration occasionally slips into overwrought sentimentality that distances the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic quality appropriate for the genre. There is a slight reliance on adjectival stacking ("profound, dusty silence," "hauntingly optimistic") that distances the reader, but the tone remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic descriptors ("profound hollowness," "cautious enchantment") that distance the reader. The tone feels more "writerly" than character-driven, filtering the experience through elevated language rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is consistent and the voice maintains a suitable gravitas ("freighted with what she knew"). The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally dips into purple phrasing ("symphony," "screamed with silence") that distracts slightly from the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV remains with Elara until the climax, where it abruptly hops into Kael’s internal experience ("He wasn’t seeing words... his heart seizing"). This unmotivated shift breaks the established limited perspective to deliver emotional information that should have been shown externally.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent in its lyric, mythic register, but it creates a "telling" filter that summarizes emotional states instead of dramatizing them. The distance is too great for intimate engagement, reading more like a legend told from afar than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending technical observation with emotional reflection in a way that suits the machinist persona.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is lyrical and consistent, fitting the melancholic atmosphere of the attic. There is a strong sense of the protagonist's worldview (astronomy metaphors).

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the magical realism tone. However, it occasionally lapses into slightly purple abstraction ("fractured hush," "bloom in his chest") or expository telling of emotional states rather than letting the strong imagery do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama ("unadulterated grace," "symphony of stressed metal"). The dialogue tags and internal monologue often tell the reader how to feel rather than evoking the emotion through restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of "cheerful gloom" that fits the premise well. The specific vocabulary ("transliterate," "buoyant") builds a distinct texture, though there is occasional distance created by filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a detached, slightly elevated tone that fits the "artist" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching the "logical dreamer" persona. The distance is stable, though slightly cool and detached. There are no head-hopping issues or major breaks in register.

    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and suitably somber for the subject matter. It maintains a distinct "high-concept sci-fi" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, matching Kaelen’s "urbane" and precise nature with elevated diction ("vivisectionist," "ideogram").

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone suitable for the subject matter. However, it relies heavily on expository telling ("She was a schemer," "Her purpose was singular") to establish character and motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending high-concept sci-fi elements with a contemplative, almost elegiac tone.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric. However, the use of meta-fictional terms ("narrative thread," "narrative sensation") creates a register drift that intellectualizes the magic, pulling the reader out of the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the weird-fiction tone with confidence. The integration of the glitchy text interface is smooth, though the "virtuously mischievous" phrasing feels slightly ornamental and "telling" rather than purely shown.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.3)

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.9)
    The POV head-hops from Kaelen to Elara ("warmth bloomed in Elara’s chest... unwanted crack") to facilitate the plot, breaking the established limited perspective. The narrative voice struggles with consistency, veering into heavy-handed abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a cohesive "moonstruck" tone. However, it frequently relies on filtering and abstract labeling ("profound concept bloomed," "shadowed rapture") instead of embodying these states in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the high-fantasy subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "telling" abstract emotions ("maelstrom of regret and panic," "chaos churning") rather than showing them through perception. This creates a psychic distance that muffles the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the high-fantasy visionary concept. However, it occasionally relies on filtering ("She felt," "She knew") and somewhat breathless phrasing that distances the reader slightly from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a somber, mythic tone suitable for the setting. However, the exact repetition of the phrase "fiercely gentle" in the second and sixth paragraphs disrupts the immersion, reading more like a prompt checklist than organic description. Otherwise, the distance and focus are well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, confident control, blending the grit of a roadie with the precise vocabulary of an appraiser ("provenance," "detritus"). The transition into and out of the memory is seamless, maintaining a stable POV distance throughout. The tone matches the "echo valley longing" perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is confident, meditative, and appropriately precise for a translator protagonist, maintaining a consistent academic-melancholic register. The narrative distance is well-controlled, allowing the high-concept analogy to land without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic solidity that suits the titan protagonist, blending mechanical terminology with lyrical description. The shift in tone from the rigid Archivist to the fluid Smelter is reflected in the rhythm of the sentences without breaking the established POV.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a poetic, elevated register that suits the "eulogy" framing. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("he found," "he understood"), but the tone effectively supports the fable-like quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, managing the "sandpaper" sensory metaphor well. It occasionally drifts into overwritten territory ("confluence of geography and grief," "desperate logic"), where the narration explains the emotion rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistently elevated and atmospheric, fitting the magical realism tone, though it occasionally tells emotions ("cautious exuberance") rather than evoking them. The POV is stable, effectively filtering the abstract world through Elara's focus.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The POV is consistent and close, effectively filtering the world through Elias's melancholic and sensory-sensitive perspective. The voice is suitably atmospheric, though it occasionally explains subtext that has already been dramatized ("He knew what it meant"), which slightly distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone, though the rhyming label "beautician mortician" clashes with the solemn register. The perspective remains distant, filtering the experience through observation rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally dips into "telling" via filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood"). The tone supports the magical realism elements well but lacks a distinct, character-specific edge.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a "noir-philosopher" texture that fits the "conscience for hire" role perfectly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, observing Kaelen's micro-movements with professional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, though the dialogue leans towards standard "wise master" aphorisms. POV is stable, filtering the experience clearly through Kael's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "reverent" character. There is a slight tendency toward filtering ("Kaelan saw," "Kaelan felt") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is stable and suits the poetic nature of the protagonist. It maintains a consistent distance, though it occasionally slips into explaining emotions ("familiar knot of inadequacy") rather than demonstrating them.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and reverent tone appropriate for the subject matter. It occasionally veers into slightly purple territory ("celestial river," "soft lights and softer sentiment"), but the focalization remains tight on Silas.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of cosmic melancholy that suits the subject matter. The shift from technical observation to awe is handled with control and appropriate distance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice matches the fable-like quality of the story, maintaining a consistent distance that allows for atmospheric description. The pacing mirrors the rhythmic focus of the protagonist's task, though the filter is occasionally distant ("Kael felt," "He believed").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholy, suiting the subject matter. However, the reliance on summary creates a psychic distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Elias's moment-to-moment experience during the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, diagnosing Elias's emotions and the significance of objects ("a process he understood," "sentiment... a fact he hid") instead of demonstrating them. This reduces intimacy and narrative distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tense, elevated tone appropriate for the "watcher" archetype. Narrative distance is well-controlled, though phrases like "ghost in the glass" veer slightly toward melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent with the meditative setting, effectively mirroring the protagonist's detached state without slipping into inconsistent interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and appropriately contemplative, matching the protagonist's persona. It effectively balances the intellectual solving process with the emotional weight of the legacy, though it occasionally strays into preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "mournfully eager" tone that balances the absurdity of the premise with genuine pathos. A few moments of expository interiority ("He was, by nature...") tell rather than show, but the overall texture is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly melancholic register that suits the guardian. The POV remains tightly anchored in Lyel’s perceptions. However, the integration of required phrases occasionally feels slightly distinct from the established voice, creating minor ripples in the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The generally elevated high-fantasy voice is disrupted by the jarringly modern idiom "penny drops" at the climax. This tonal break, combined with the tense error, undermines the established narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the "celestial" subject matter. The point of view is stable, though occasional filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt") distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but relies heavily on stock phrasing ("panic was a luxury," "terrifying clarity," "close call"). The perspective remains stable, but the tone leans into "competence porn" where the protagonist effortlessly understands the unknowable.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly detached tone that fits the "rational enchantment" concept. While effective, the voice occasionally slips into dry explanation of the magic system's rules rather than letting the strangeness breathe on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and authoritative, suiting the "instructor" persona with stable distance control. It occasionally slips into abstract labeling of emotion ("marvel of it was breathtaking") but generally maintains a distinct, elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled but tends toward a breathless, elevated register that creates distance. The reliance on explaining the protagonist's nature ("He wasn’t a medium... he was a technician") rather than dramatizing it weakens the immediacy of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe POV consistency failure occurs in the second paragraph, switching jarringly from third-person ("Elias") to first-person ("my grandmother," "I remembered") and back. This unmotivated head-hopping breaks the narrative frame and distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    The meditative tone is consistent and controls the pacing well, suiting the quiet observatory setting. However, the poetic register occasionally feels performative ("salvage operation for the soul"), distancing the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately mythic, controlling the pacing well. However, it relies occasionally on filtering ("I felt," "I knew") and slightly melodramatic phrasing that distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is atmospheric and consistent, capturing the "damp, cool" mood effectively. However, it leans occasionally on explanatory assertions ("This world operates on its own logic") rather than trusting the dramatization to convey the rules of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre but relies heavily on filtering ("She knew," "She felt," "She understood"), creating unnecessary distance. The tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("intoxicating perfume of freedom") that reduces the emotional impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a distinct mood, though it occasionally filters immediate action through heavy poetic abstraction that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The distance is well-controlled, staying close to Elias's perception without slipping into head-hopping. The tone supports the magical realism elements without breaking suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated to match the "sanely eccentric" librarian persona. Control of psychic distance is generally good, though the brief hop to the patron's internal reaction ("dismissed it") slightly blurs the otherwise tight focus on Elias. The tone supports the magical realism effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the fable-like mode, though the psychic distance remains somewhat remote. The tone dictates the reader's emotional response through elevated adjectives rather than allowing the feeling to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable third-person distance. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction without grounding the emotional beats in specific behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies too heavily on filter verbs ("he watched," "he heard") which creates unnecessary distance during the discovery beat. A more immediate psychic distance would enhance the sense of awe.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and controlled. There is a slight POV slide in the opening paragraph—moving from Kael’s internal perception of fractures to Elara watching him—but it stabilizes quickly into a coherent focus on Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reverent and breathless ("symphony of the high places," "sacred act"), creating a distance that prevents intimacy. The tone fits the genre but feels monochromatic, lacking the modulation or distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, somewhat elevated tone appropriate for the high-fantasy setting. The narrator's authority is palpable, though at times the register drifts into slightly melodramatic phrasing ("echoed only in the soul") that feels less grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the protagonist's understanding and motivation. The psychic distance is often too great, summarizing the emotional import of scenes ("she understood that her job was not...") rather than immersing the reader in the immediate experience of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately detached, fitting the "analytic" attribute well. The personification of the ROV ("Mortimer") provides a necessary focal point for the narrator's isolated perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "balladeer" persona. However, it suffers from a tendency toward purple phrasing and modifier stacking ("driftingly alert," "pregnant with unshed sound") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent and appropriate for a dutiful yet observant character. There is a slight register drift in the middle ("stray photons," "schematic of polarized hues") that clashes with the established fantasy/magic tone ("shimmering script").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly controlled, maintaining a consistent distance that matches the character's physical and emotional isolation. The prose rhythm mirrors the drifting gondola, creating a unity of form and content. Perception is filtered strictly through Elias's meteorologist lens, enhancing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and controlled, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. The third-person limited perspective stays firmly anchored in Elara’s sensory experience, filtering descriptions through her pattern-seeking worldview. The transition from the dusty silence to the celestial finale is handled with smooth tonal modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a steady, slightly elevated tone suitable for the genre. However, it leans on telling over showing ("profound yet sociable isolation") and misses opportunities to filter the world more deeply through Elias's unique cartographer perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened, mythic tone appropriate for the genre. The narrative distance is controlled, though the prose occasionally leans into slightly purple descriptors ("silent screams trapped") that distance the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative suffers from unmotivated head-hopping, shifting from Elara’s perspective to the ghost’s internal monologue ("He saw their potential") to explain the plot. This expository intrusion deflates the mystery and breaks the established limited voice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic register. However, it frequently slips into melodramatic phrasing ("screaming moments," "aching wonder") that distances the reader. The tone holds, but the lack of distinct, grounded texture limits engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somber, atmospheric tone that suits the "cursed" subject matter. The POV remains tightly anchored in Elias’s resignation and expertise, though it occasionally leans into adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, high-quality close third-person filter, effectively blending scientific lexicon ("surfactants," "monomers") with emotional introspection. The distance control is steady and appropriate for the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a polished, lyrical tone appropriate for a modern fable. The control of rhythm is steady, though the high-fantasy register occasionally distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable distance. The shift in Kaelen’s internal state is reflected in the prose, moving from the "echoes" of the opening to the "solid and real" peace of the close.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice struggles to integrate the disparate prompt elements naturally. The narrative distance is somewhat clinical, explaining Elias's motivations and the meaning of his actions rather than immersing the reader in the immediate sensory experience of the psychic storm.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the "helix-minded" protagonist well. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the focus tight on Elara’s internal perception without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. However, there is a tendency toward slightly melodramatic descriptors ("lethal inversion," "breathtaking") that occasionally distance the reader. The perspective remains firmly with Kael throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The reverent, mythic tone is consistent and suits the material well. The narrative distance occasionally slips into filtering ("she realized," "she felt"), and the direct insertion of prompt labels ("symphonically minded") feels clunky within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    The elevated, somewhat academic voice suits the character of a royal tutor well. However, the psychic distance remains static, keeping the reader at arm's length even during the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lush, matching Elias’s "theatrical sincerity." The third-person limited perspective stays firmly with his sensory experience, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly purple territory ("tapestry of pinprick stars") that feels less disciplined than the character's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is generally atmospheric and consistent, but occasional phrasing disrupts the immersion. "Journalize" reads as anachronistic corporate-speak in a fantasy setting, and "olfactorily sensitive" is clinical compared to the lyrical tone established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("grace that defied its own violence") that creates distance. The tone fits the fable-like quality of the story but lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistently analytical and controlled, matching the protagonist’s detached professional persona. The tone maintains a "hazy precision" throughout, though the shift to summary in the climax slightly distances the reader from the POV's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.7)
    The mythic tone is consistent but creates distance, prioritizing elevated abstractions over grounded experience. The voice dictates how the reader should feel ("spontaneous joy," "profound") rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. However, it occasionally drifts into melodramatic abstraction ("captured sliver of sun") and adjective-heavy phrasing that creates a layer of distance between the reader and the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the genre. However, the shift in focalization from Elias's detached observation to Anya's internal realization at the end ("She was her grief, she realized...") is a slight breach of the established distance, acting as a functional baton pass rather than a seamlessly integrated POV.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is consistent and the voice fits the genre, though it relies on filter verbs ("He saw them," "He watched") that distance the reader during the climax. The tone is maintained, but the internal monologue leans slightly towards exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice successfully balances scientific precision with mystical yearning, perfectly mirroring the protagonist's internal duality. The control of psychic distance during the revelation is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered through a poeticized, melodramatic register ("gossamer connection," "ancient grace"). This tonal distance prevents the visceral reality of the sacrifice from hitting as hard as it should.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, fitting the fable-like tone well. However, the voice occasionally slips into expository summary to accommodate prompt requirements ("His motivation was...", "His attribute was..."), which momentarily distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric filter appropriate for a "cartographer of ghosts," blending technical language with lyricism. The perspective remains tightly controlled, ensuring that the sensory exposition feels like character experience rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. It occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought description ("haunted lantern room," "frenzy of foam") that distances the reader from the protagonist's grounded mechanic persona.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama, using "manic" descriptors and elevated diction that distances the reader. The tone feels performative, prioritizing mythic grandeur over the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric, fitting the "valley-mist" tone well. However, it occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("steam... curled into questioning shapes") that distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the "quiet hum" of the protagonist's work. The tone is controlled and fits the magical realism genre well, though the emotional distance prevents a deeper connection to the "consuming need" described in the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone. However, the reliance on standard fantasy phrasing ("sharp as a thorn," "thin as a spider’s thread") keeps the voice from achieving a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but tends toward melodrama and purple prose ("precipice of midnight," "silent clarity of a sunrise"). The tone matches the intent but lacks the freshness required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and filtered through Elara's observant, slightly melancholic voice. The narrative distance is well-managed, zooming in on the bread's texture at the crucial moment to ground the emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for a "Records Chief," avoiding head-hopping. However, the register occasionally drifts into ornamental excess ("brilliant, defiant nova") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice is generally consistent, but the clumsy insertion of the required attribute phrase ("her attribute of being curiously steadfast") breaks the narrative distance and immersion. This moment feels like authorial intrusion rather than character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and well-tuned to the magical realism genre. Narrative distance is managed effectively, keeping the reader close to Elara's sensory experience while maintaining her analytical filter.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, suiting the "crystalline" setting. Internal monologue is consistent, though it occasionally drifts into slightly heavy-handed thematic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a reverent, slightly fable-like tone appropriate for the genre. However, the narrative distance is somewhat remote, summarizing emotions ("strange hope bloomed") rather than inhabiting them viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic elevation ("ancient glacier," "pearlescent sky") that suits the fable-like genre. However, the tone is somewhat distant, and the "seasonal muteness" offers a missed opportunity for a unique, sensory-focused perceptual signature that could have enriched the prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The POV is stable and maintains a consistent "robotic but feeling" texture throughout. The narrative distance is well-controlled, allowing the reader to inhabit the android's specific perceptual signature. The voice falters only slightly during the climax, where it leans into generic dramatic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated ("thumb long since turned to dust," "reedy hum"), creating a fable-like distance that clashes with the modern setting. The "storytelling tapestry" metaphor feels overwrought for the narrative scope.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, matching the "lyrical code breaker" persona with elevated, rhythmic diction. At times, the tone drifts into slightly overwrought phrasing ("splintered by genius"), but it maintains a cohesive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. The tone appropriately matches the melancholy subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("hollows of his life," "fragile testament against the void").

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, high-fantasy lyricism that fits the subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, frequently stepping in to explain the significance of actions ("an act of such precision it could be mistaken for loyalty") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.9)
    Voice consistency is shattered by the intrusion of technical jargon ("progressive disclosure") into a mythic fantasy tone. The narrator suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly summarizing the meaning of events instead of allowing the dramatization to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "vigil" tone, but maintains a high psychic distance that keeps the reader at arm's length. The "unseen director" perspective dilutes the immediacy of the confrontation, favoring observation over immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, contemplative tone that suits the protagonist. The distance is controlled, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly precious phrasing ("shy moon," "quiet creature") that draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled, precise, and appropriately analytical, matching Kaelen’s worldview. The third-person limited POV is stable, though it occasionally leans into exposition to clarify the physics rather than staying deep in the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a high-gothic, slightly elevated tone that suits the "lonely visionary" archetype. The prose texture supports the atmosphere, though it occasionally veers into melodrama ("tasted of ozone and regret") that feels slightly performed.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical, fable-like voice is maintained consistently ("whisper of wind," "grey silk"), fitting the genre well. The narrative distance is appropriate, and the rhythmic control supports the quiet, atmospheric tone without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") that create unnecessary distance during high-tension beats. The tone matches the "fleshly ethereal" prompt but feels slightly adjective-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the high-concept setting. It occasionally leans into elevated abstractions ("aching simplicity") that distance the reader slightly from grounded interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, aptly somber tone that suits the subject matter. There is a slight tendency toward "purple" phrasing ("frail note," "impartial glory") that draws attention to the writing itself, but the POV remains stable and intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the subject matter. However, the dialogue and internal monologue occasionally slip into stock phrasing ("beautiful disaster," "no sense building a church...") which detracts slightly from the unique tonal promise.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the setting. However, it occasionally leans into adjective-heavy description ("impossibly steady," "frantic drumbeat") that softens the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately grave, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("shadow-laced peacekeeper"). The perspective stays firmly with Kael, maintaining control, though the elevated tone sometimes distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and slightly detached tone that fits Elara's "muted" worldview. The shift between the gritty details of the debris and her philosophical interiority is handled smoothly. There is a strong sense of a distinct perceptual signature, though it occasionally tells the reader what to feel ("peculiar kind of peace").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    The lyrical, meditative voice is generally consistent but suffers a severe register fracture with the intrusion of clinical jargon ("intersubjective"). This single phrase disrupts the established distance and texture, momentarily turning a rustic focalizer into a philosophy professor.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fantasy setting, maintaining a focused third-person POV. There is occasional reliance on filter verbs ("sensed," "found") that slightly distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like atmosphere, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("lavender-scented sky"). The narrative distance is too great, prioritizing summary over immediate, sensory experience of the character's work.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and fittingly curatorial ("keeper of catalogued endings"). The perspective remains firmly with Elias. The shift to a more wondrous tone at the end is earned, though the middle section relies slightly heavily on filter verbs ("He heard," "He realized") that distance the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and melancholic, suiting the "junkyard prophet" archetype without slipping into melodrama. The narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader firmly anchored in Silas's deteriorating perception of the future-past.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately focused on Elias's internal state and perception. The shift from technical observation to philosophical realization feels earned and natural within the POV. Narrative distance is controlled well during the high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, slightly elevated tone that matches the hospice setting ("composition of care," "hymning the mundane"). However, the distance is somewhat remote, prioritizing the aesthetic beauty of the scene over the gritty reality of death or estrangement. The control is good, but the effect is sanitized.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately scholarly, though it occasionally suffers from register clashes, such as the whimsical &quot;spoons bent reality&quot; alongside high-fantasy phrasing like &quot;velvet of the void.&quot; The tone serves the story but feels slightly detached, lacking a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending a slightly formal, intellectual tone with deep emotional vulnerability. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elias's specialized understanding of the world (anatomy, structure) even as that structure collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Elara, filtering the world through her celestial obsession. At times, the "purple" diction threatens to distance the reader, but the rhythm generally supports the meditative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the "hush" of the setting. However, it occasionally slips into explanatory filtering ("understood that his silence was not empty") rather than trusting the dramatized moment to convey the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "literary fantasy" tone is largely consistent but is punctured by jarring, prompt-forced phrasing like "ephemeral cameo appearances," which introduces a technical/cinematic register that clashes with the magical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a generic "high fantasy" tone that feels detached and ornamental. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature for Elian, relying instead on standard elevated diction ("colossal," "luminous," "suple") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, matching the reverence of the alchemical ritual. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Kaelen’s sensory experience, and the "surgeon" metaphor effectively conveys his precision. The prose maintains a distinct texture that suits the fantasy elements without slipping into generic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and appropriately contemplative, matching the protagonist's persona. The psychic distance is stable, keeping the reader close to Elian’s perception of the light and mechanics without slipping into unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately lyrical, fitting the high-fantasy tone. However, the phrasing occasionally strains for effect ("boundary-lessly trapped" is clunky and breaks immersion). The perspective is stable, but the register sometimes drifts into adjective-heavy description that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the meditative pace of the story. However, it occasionally lapses into slightly elevated, "purple" phrasing ("ocean of stillness," "breath on a cold day") that feels more decorative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and elevated tone that suits the setting. The distance is generally well-controlled, though there are moments of slight expository drift. The dialogue is functional but occasionally feels a bit staged to serve the backstory ("Are you sure about the harmonics report?").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and polished, fitting the contemplative engineer persona. However, it occasionally slips into explanatory filtering ("She recognized," "she understood") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose. The reverence of the tone matches the character well.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately moody, suiting the "legend seeker" persona. Occasional lapses into purple diction ("nascent light," "liminal quiet") slightly distract from the grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like quality that suits the subject matter well. The perspective is stable, filtering the world through Elias's specialized knowledge, though the tone occasionally drifts into abstract reverence that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, maintaining the "lonesome splendor" tone throughout. However, the register often drifts into "writerly" affectation ("breath of autumn," "mournful fire") that feels performed rather than authentically perceived.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice aims for a high, mythic tone but occasionally stumbles into purple prose ("quaking reverie") or clunky, unmotivated phrasing ("obsessive method of hypothesizing about everything"). These tonal shifts break the immersion and feel like artificial insertions rather than organic character voice. The register is generally consistent but lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally strays into purple prose ("ghost ship on a glassy sea," "weeping gashes"). The narrative distance is stable, keeping close to Elara’s perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a polished, atmospheric tone ("clean, hard light") that suits the magical realism genre. Narrative distance is well-controlled, though the interiority sometimes drifts into explaining the character's traits rather than showing them in action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the mythic/fable-like quality of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Xylar, effectively filtering the environment through the specific lens of a "sentimentalist."

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama and heavy-handed poeticism ("thundering calm," "bleeds across the horizon"). The reliance on abstract emotional labels distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent but distanced by frequent filter verbs ("He felt," "He believed," "He envisioned") and the "He [verb]" syntactic pattern, which creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy, writerly style that creates distance rather than intimacy. The register occasionally drifts into melodrama ("crushing weight of a journey never completed") that feels unearned by the on-page events. The tone is cohesive but lacks the rhythmic variation needed to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, matching the gravity of the task. However, the psychic distance is often distant, relying on filter verbs ("He felt," "He thought," "He stared") that keep the reader observing the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and reverent, suiting the "devotional" nature of the protagonist's work. However, the tone occasionally feels elevated to the point of detachment, prioritizing poetic description over the visceral grit of the dystopian reality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    The reverent, somber tone is well-maintained and suits the subject matter. However, the narrative voice occasionally lapses into clunky, manual-like phrasing ("guided him... through incomplete information") that breaks the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is distinct—intellectual, weary, and precise—fitting the protagonist perfectly. The shift from internal reflection to dialogue is smooth, though the "diagnostic" narration in the first half feels slightly more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a contemplative tone throughout. However, the diction occasionally leans into sentimentality (&quot;fragile music breathe,&quot; &quot;magnificent decay&quot;) that distances the reader from the grit of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent but occasionally lapses into abstract summary and interpretive telling. The narrative distance keeps the emotional stakes at arm's length, and the tone shifts into diagnostic jargon ("synaptic plasticity") that jars with the atmospheric opening.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story commits a clear head-hopping violation, shifting from Silas’s focalization to Lena’s internal realization (“She finally understood his purpose”) mid-scene. This breach of psychic distance undermines the narrative control. The voice is otherwise consistent but marred by this structural error.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is strong, maintaining a consistent, slightly elevated lyrical tone that suits the protagonist's "archivist" persona. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Elara’s creeping normality lens, though the narration occasionally directs the reader's interpretation too rigidly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The single POV is strictly maintained, handling the telepathic inputs without head-hopping or confusion. The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical mission language with the elevated, atmospheric tone of the underwater setting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the mythic setting, though it occasionally dips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("geography of sameness"). The perspective remains firmly anchored in Elian’s experience.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent but leans into elevated, abstract phrasing ("lexicon of grace," "descent into imagery") that creates distance. The tone borders on sentimental, reducing the grit of the dystopian setting.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately solemn but suffers from repetitive tagging ("historically oriented man/mind"). The narration occasionally slips into expository summary ("connection between warmth, creation, and survival") that distances the reader from the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated tone that suits the mythic quality of the clockmaker. The perspective stays firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his technical and philosophical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately surreal for the genre. The distinction between the narrator's thoughts and the advisor's "silken" voice is maintained. The tone supports the high-concept narrative without slipping.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic subject matter. However, the blend of archaic/natural diction ("leeward," "mallet") with technical/mathematical terms ("fractal generating," "dub") creates occasional register friction that feels more like authorial insertion than character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "mythic" tone. However, it occasionally slips into clichéd phrasing ("The world held its breath") that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate sensory experience. The focus on Kaelen remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly formal, resulting in stiff, stagey dialogue that lacks naturalistic rhythm. The "measured as a metronome" tone flattens the emotional variance between the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("skeletal hand reaching from a watery grave," "sickening lurch"). The elevated register occasionally feels performative ("inexorable," "solemn mission") rather than organic to the surveyor's grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and appropriately elevated to match the scholarly protagonist ("sacrilege," "provenance"). The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering all sensory details—like the "shriek of wood"—through Elias’s distinct, logical sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a poetic and melancholic register appropriate for the content. It effectively conveys the protagonist's emotional landscape, though the high-flown diction occasionally creates a distance between the reader and the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a high-intensity, poetic register that suits the "obsessed scientist" archetype. While it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("festering heart"), the tone generally supports the high-stakes, metaphysical nature of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice is generally consistent but marred by a significant tense shift in the second sentence ("after the pilgrim arrives" vs "had vanished"). The tone leans into purple description ("universe's quiet enigmas") which distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a somber, noir-inflected tone appropriate for the subject. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("bleeding from blue to bruised purple") that prioritizes poetic sound over narrative precision.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and melancholic, fitting the mood. However, the phrase "in his uncommonly thoughtful way" constitutes a breach of the close third-person filter, reading as authorial characterization rather than character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly "writerly," prioritizing poetic effect over immediacy. The distance created by the heavy metaphor usage ("cartography of his failure," "pilot light in his soul") prevents a tight psychic bond with the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("planting a forest in a desert of ash"). The tone matches the melancholic subject matter but lacks distinct textural variation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like tragedy. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("singular, damning message," "hollow of his heart"), which slightly distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately lyrical for a story about a cartomancer. The control of psychic distance is solid, staying close to Elara’s perception throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistently reverent and lyrical, matching the fable-like tone of the narrative. The narrative distance is stable, though the register occasionally drifts into high-flown sentimentality that risks distancing the reader from the immediate physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and controlled but adopts a precious, elevated tone that distances the reader. The reliance on grandiose abstractions ("heavens were engaged," "singular motivation") creates a fable-like quality that lacks intimacy or distinct perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is stable and maintains the requested "winking hush" tone, conveying secrecy and suppressed excitement. The voice is consistent, though it relies on somewhat standard thriller phrasing ("practiced casualness") rather than a unique perceptual signature. The internal monologue is functional but doesn't deeply explore the character's psyche beyond the immediate mission.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and well-suited to the mythic sci-fi tone. POV remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the cosmic events through Kael's specific burden and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.6)
    The poetic, slightly elevated voice fits the character of a censored poet, maintaining a consistent filter on the world. However, the narration occasionally slips into melodrama ("screaming hurricane," "acid of his memories") that feels performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that fits the "dueling philosopher" persona. The perspective is tightly controlled, and the seamless integration of mechanical and philosophical terminology enhances the specific flavor of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, perfectly matching the "penny poet" persona. The POV remains tightly controlled, filtering the world effectively through Silas's romantic, reconstructive gaze without slipping into authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent but relies on a high-flown register ("silvered sorrow," "unforgiving mists") that drifts into melodrama, creating a distance that softens the urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally dips into summary to explain Elara's internal state rather than showing it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a melodramatic register that prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over clarity ("vast canvas of cerulean regret"). The POV stays with Kenji, but the distance is often too close to the abstract concepts and too far from grounded, embodied experience. The "slow-spoken" trait is told rather than shown through dialogue or distinct internal cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Aris’s scientific sensorium: neutron-star vocabulary, vector language, chitin optics. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees “ugly equation” not “tragedy.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure: short declaratives during wipe, then a long breath to end. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Minor template cadence in “He would…” lines just below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric, slightly elevated register suits a woman who hears in color. Syntax flexes with pressure—“the violet deepened, swirling with threads of silver”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature is consistent: thermal vision always filtered through circlet bias. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. One template cadence (“She… She… She…”) in para 1, but it teaches pattern and pays off in ritual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers at a distance that matches Elias’s exhausted remove; diction stays mortuary-lean (“gave rest a permanent address”) without poetic inflation. Rhythm accords to pressure—short clauses under the sea, longer sinuous sentences in the library’s hush. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature clear in his noticing of fracture patterns as spiderwebs of despair. One syntactic run of three “he” openers mid-descent keeps it from 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent with an artist-viewpoint: “pilgrim of sparks,” “luminous ghost of reality.” Perceptual signature is strong—notice of light, dew, vein-like petal rivers.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers at Elias’s shoulder, lexicon of drafting and geometry credible for a maze-maker; perceptual signature in leaf-screen hallucinations is sustained. Rhythm flexes—long cadence for memory, staccato for final disintegration—without template drift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Single POV never slips; free indirect “he had thought it was the answer” keeps modest distance.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: she reads the city through “vibrations in the links,” measures time in “three thousand days,” notices fletching pattern before material. Syntax lengthens then fragments under pressure—“A groan of ancient gears answered her”—mirroring her controlled hurry. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; diction (“clandestine collection of life,” “ghost of manufactured joy”) remains within a strategic, horticultural lexicon she would plausibly hold. Voice modulates but never breaks pattern, and the final compressed clause “her purpose was now free” lands with cadence payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature saturates prose: colors sing, moss hums, aurora screams. Syntax stays tidal—long sentences for underwater light, fractured fragments at climax: “a sound like grinding glass and tearing silk.” No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs fused to nouns (“salt-streaked glass,” “compact-ash forge”). Register stable—never drifts into clinical or self-help diction. Rhythmic acceleration during compression beat mirrors cardiac tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lush yet controlled lyricism—“ghost haunting the brief, perfect moments,” “universe dream in a bottle”—is consistent with a visually obsessed thief. Syntax lengthens in calm beats, shortens in stealth beats, matching pulse. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature is sharp: moonlight is “honeyed,” then “silver,” always filtered through an artist’s gaze. One tiny scaffold: three sentences open “He…” in the final paragraph; pattern is not taught, so a −0.2 applies, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice carries glassblower precision—molten silica, starlight, crucible—yet modulates from theatrical boom to tremor under threat. Syntax mirrors pressure: lush clauses collapse into clipped “And with a final bow.” Perceptual signature (noticing rust showers, pipe drip as metronome) stays consistent; no head-hop, no filter clutter; dramatic narration device is taught early and paid off in choked exit line.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “the cold metal…bit into my palms,” “a spray of distant stars,” “the rusted floor fell away.” Syntax tightens under stress—fragments like “This was real.” punch against longer reflective coils. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is strong (“keyed,” “flashed,” “vanished”). Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Julian’s actor-smile versus the hero’s inner script.

Rhythm slows into long sentences that mimic held breath, then fractures at climax to mirror release.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers at a reverent distance, matching Elias’s guardedness; syntax leans on tactile verbs (“ran a hand,” “pulled,” “tapped”) and weathered diction (“gnarled,” “smoky quartz”).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: hydraulic-stained hands, tool-specific vocabulary, quiet vertigo rendered as “mechanically warm” sensation.

    Third-person hovers at an ecstatic middle distance—precise musical lexicon, yet lyric cadence (“dark mirror,” “unshed tear”). Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens at the soak. No head-hop; perception stays Elias-bound. Filter verbs rare; metaphors organic to venue. Risky repetition of “hush” and “silence” is pattern-taught and paid off when the living city finally intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is sinewy and climate-specific: “raw wool,” “ozone from the storm two nights ago,” “hygrometer by feel.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s data-filtered mind without ever sounding report-like. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she was peripherally aware”). Rhythm clusters in short, cold clauses that breathe with altitude.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person voice is cohesive, rhythmic, character-specific: short, tactile clauses mimic breath-holding exploration; hyphenated adjectives ("sleep-deprivation filter") feel like his engineer mind. Perceptual signature—radio chatter as rational tether—remains consistent and paid off when caller mirrors his predicament. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under fatigue. Compression ("drowsy alertness") is taught early and holds to final exhausted cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    First-person voice sustains a dusty, archaic register without slipping into mock-antique; syntax lengthens and contracts like breath during fold-transition.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s sensorium; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: “slow crawl of afternoon shadows” mirrors his unhurried tempo; kalimba tines “coax quiet from stones” is therapist-apt.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is dense, vaulted, ecclesiastical—“bronze quiet,” “cupping memory like water”—yet filtered through a scholar who notices thread-of-gold fire before he notices his own pulse. Syntax lengthens and breathes like dust motes; no drumbeat cadence. Compression is purposeful: “the colors are fading… from the mind” packs diagnosis and elegy into five words. POV distance holds steady; no leakage into Elara’s head beyond what ink can testify.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature: “faint, tinny echo,” “ghostly metronome.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at exit (“He packed… He descended”).

Rhythm modulates with pressure; read-aloud ear test clean.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, yet always Kael-sighted: “each droplet…like a fallen star” is perceptual, not decorative. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during loop chaos, then steadies as geometry stabilizes. No head-hopping; flicker-Kael is external hallucination, not POV drift. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and justified; diction stays within plausible lexicon.

    Third-limited clings to Elias’s perceptual circuitry: “quiet, ordered language of data,” “elegant physics of a cold front,” giving rhythmic signature of restrained scientific lyricism. No head-hop; city remains opaque as he experiences it. Compression like “whetstone, sharpening his focus” is brief, pattern-taught by earlier metaphor chain, paid off in final line. Dialogue absent—appropriate for a solitude arc—and narrative voice stays consistent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature: olfactory bias, light-fracture obsession, lantern-dealer diction (“faceted coolness”). Rhythm modulates—long humid sentences early, short staccato at bloom (“And then it came.”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Filter verbs minimal; “he suspected” justified by reflective moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)

Register never drifts above the conjurer’s quietly scholarly idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual bias—silverfish grit, magnetic pulse felt in fingertips—never ventriloquizing Anya.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual palette: colors are named by pigment, time in tides, value in trade or story. Syntax lengthens under insomnia fatigue, then tightens at the discovery: “Lodged in the pale, stone-like wood…” Voice modulates without register drift; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is minimal, idiomatically worn, and carries subtext (“I don’t want much”) that advances the bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person stays tightly anchored to Lyra’s perceptual filter; sound verbs dominate, matching musical premise. Syntax lengthens during the rush of returned sight, then shortens at release, reflecting pulse. No dialogue clutter; when Kael speaks it’s low and resonant, a foil to crystal chime.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person POV stays locked to Elara’s perceptual sieve: verbs of precision (“charting,” “isolating”) and synesthetic slippage (sound = texture). Rhythm mirrors procedure—long sentences during slow charting, staccato fragments at pitch shift. No dialogue, so voice carries entire load; diction never exceeds her plausible lexicon. Compression (“incandescent restraint”) is earned because earlier beats have shown the furnace of her discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)

    Third-person limited remains locked to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: sentences angle toward measurement, magnification, metal fatigue. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic alternation between short declaratives and longer, gas-filled clauses that mimic thermal expansion. No dialogue, so no register drift. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to tremble”) is forgiven as character-uncertainty, not narrator hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is astronomer-poetic (“dust-stars,” “microscopic waltz”) yet stays credible for a grieving amateur. Syntax modulates: long, star-mapping sentences in calm, clipped fragments during leak. No head-hopping; Anna’s interior is rightly opaque. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, voice-true. One minor filter verb cluster (“he imagined them released”) could trim, but it doesn’t mar the overall rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s astrologer perception—geothermal “circulatory system,” jelly “meadow of stars.” Syntax lengthens under awe, then compresses at the exhale. Elara’s single whispered line carries maximal subtext; earlier curtness contrasts. No head-hopping; diction stays within Kaelen’s poetic yet plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is crystalline, compressed, rhythmically buoyant—“cheerful gloom” diction sustained without lapse. Perceptual signature is distinct: Kael sees emotion as color spectra, filters every noun through light. Syntax stays clean, no filter-verb fog; metaphor is internally coherent (geode, vines, transliteration). Minor 0.3 deduction for occasional poet-template cadence (“Then, abruptly…”) but never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s analytic sensorium; diction (“silver tongue licking foundations,” “polished mitre”) is precise, tactile, and consistent. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure, mirroring his calculus-to-wonder shift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person intimate sustains obsidian grace: syntax lengthens and softens during dance, fragments into star-breath at the anchor-moment, then firms for the final epitaph-on-skin. Perceptual signature—measuring voids in primrose exhale—remains idiosyncratic and consistent; no head-hops or filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within Kaelen’s poet-exile lexicon; the single overt phrase “cosmic verse” is justified because it is literally enacted. Rhythm modulates cleanly with pressure; the lyric pattern is taught early and paid off in the final clause “ etched into his very skin,” earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline: sentences refract, syntactic angles vary, vocabulary stays within glazier’s lexicon (facet, geometry, vapor). No dialogue, so evaluation is rhythm and filter control; free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “felt”) are motive-driven, not hedging. Opening and closing lines book-end with light imagery that re-circulates meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; no leakage. Diction—“house screaming,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”—bears his firefighter-poet tongue. Syntax lengthens during memory, shortens on ridge, mirroring breath. Dialogue sparse, subtextual: “Bargained innocence” spoken once, carries full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is disciplined scientific lyric—”quantum nudges,” “staggeringly complex idea”—precise yet luminous. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices angles of spirals, inter-dimensional hum, salt film, never tourist clutter. No head-hop, no POV leakage; psychic distance tightens imperceptibly as tide rises. The only micro-slip is one “she felt” filter that could have been cut, but rhythm recovers instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is tight third with consistent perceptual signature: Elara’s hearing is “sensitively perceptive,” filtering every detail through acoustic bias. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, never drumming; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“acoustics,” “frequency”) without academic drift. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hop. Voice modulates from hush to chill without breaking texture.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent idiom of hush, fractured color, and musical syntax. No dialogue, so mechanics issues are moot. Perceptual signature—selective attention to shimmer, echo, wetness—remains painter-specific. Compression (“a thousand liquid rainbows”) is taught early and pays off in the light-conducting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual lens; no head-hop. Syntax—“operative gentleness,” “midwife a peace”—carries strategist cadence. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for persuasion, staccato fragments at sigil moment. Filter verbs absent; perception concrete. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when Vorlag’s grunt replaces speech. No register drift; diction stays within war-weary diplomat range.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is relentless, salted, precise—“manufactured drought killed the rivers,” “calligraphy of cracks.” Syntax lengthens in lyrical cadence then fractures in short clauses mirroring shell dissolution. No head-hop; focalization stays locked to Vance’s guilty sensorium. Diction never exceeds his worldly lexicon yet achieves poetic elevation, a controlled paradox that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter: every metaphor is one she could plausibly craft—starlight as filament, regret as frost. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the dance, creating muscular rhythm without drumbeat monotony. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; the elevated register is justified by her cultivated persona.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice carries a calligrapher’s tactile precision—“delicate dance of brush on vellum,” “perfectly rendered ideogram”—yet stays restrained, aligning with urbane serenity. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then shortens at the decision beat, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Register remains elevated but plausible for an artist who carves ideograms; no corporate drift. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“he felt the first tremor”).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays inside Elias’s perceptual rim: filigree of dust and light, soil grammar. Lyric diction ("blushing stillness") is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final blush of sky. Rhythm modulates with task tempo; no filter-verb clutter. Voice is distinct and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, tactile, and wax-caster specific: “surgeon’s precision born from the memory of clumsy, grieving hands.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences during braiding, clipped fragments at the breath-holding moment before glow. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays cleanly inside Elian’s perceptual filter. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; even “conceptual repricing” is rendered as “ghost of a ghost.”

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is rigorous astronomer—star-catalog syntax, metallic consonants, refusal of metaphor until the sky provides one. Rhythm accelerates with chalk-lines, breathes during hum. Filter verbs absent; diction stays within Babylonian-tech lexicon. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Under stress, syntax compresses to single-clause observational bursts that mirror star-count precision.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—temperature, pressure, frequency—never ventriloquizing Vale. Syntax lengthens during memory broadcast, then fractures into short clauses as the sanctuary tears, mirroring Vale’s flicker. No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon of cellular and acoustic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s quartz-eye perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax grows shorter under branch-top stress: “He took the tiny seed…pushed.” Distinct perceptual signature—milky quartz vision filters every sensory note. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation collapses to interior texture, which remains consistent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature: astronomical metaphors, botanical lexicon, recursive time-speak. Syntax flexes with pressure (“frantic, beautiful chaos”). No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he saw the pale, confused face”). Rhythm accelerates into the breakthrough, then settles into grave cadence—effective modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter: colors are measured against paint squares, the air tastes of rust because she is “a walking paradox.” Syntax lengthens under stress (“silent, dark, liquid warmth…”) then fractures into the staccato realization “a life unmade.” No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Free indirect style is clean: “Her own memory…was now fraught” carries her diction without filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is consistent archivist: “a library in itself,” “page torn from a book that never was.” Syntax modulates from long curator clauses to surgical fragments during the braiding beat. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within a scholar’s lexicon. One tiny lapse—“temporal anomaly ticking away”—slips toward textbook idiom, barely audible.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited remains locked to Elian’s perceptual signature: glass hum heard only in memory, starlanes read as “winter sky” not astronomy text. Syntax lengthens under starlight, then fractures into short clauses at shard insertion, mirroring tension. No head-hop; diction stays within custodian lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter—lightning after-images, rod tremor in damp fingers. Syntax lengthens under storm tension, then contracts to short declaratives at the console. No head-hopping; diction stays within his antiquarian lexicon. A single filter-verb cluster (“he saw… he felt…”) during the white-out is acceptable stress compression.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s pyrotechnician perceptual signature—chemical names, color terms, ambient fuse-listening. Rhythm modulates: incantatory chant vs compressed filter moment. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Psychic distance stable; no head-hopping. Prose as character: syntax mirrors fuse-burn pacing. No register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual signature—fossil-veined wings, tidal-pool metaphors, starlight travel time. No head-hopping; Kael’s face is read from the outside. Syntax breathes with emotional cadence: long reflective sentences build to the short, declarative final line. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal-only and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that still stays anchored in Elian’s proprioceptive terror—“lungs seized,” “bones tremor.” Syntax breathes with altitude: clauses lengthen in open sky, tighten on descent, no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice remains pure image-stream faithful to POV.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s calm, precise register; perceptual signature is the catalog of faint vibrations. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the glide of the boat; no filter-verb clusters. Passenger’s brief dialogue is thin but sufficient contrast. Voice is the story’s engine and remains controlled under the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays lashed to Elara’s perceptual bias—she “reads” paint as data-sealer, hears rock as resonant substrate. Syntax lengthens during sonic work, contracts at sunrise: “She pressed… It clicked…” mirroring pulse. No head-hop; even the AI’s ping is filtered through her wrist-unit. The diction—“kaleidoscopic,” “palimpsest,” “metallophytes”—feels native to a Lore Keeper’s lexicon, not thesaurus tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—calloused thumb, ozone scent, recruiter hallucinations. Diction is precise but avoids corporate jargon; syntax tightens under pressure (“guttural cry born of old rage”). Glitch-text fragments are pattern-taught early and remain legible. Voice never explains what Elara already knows; interiority is shown via bolt-focus and sensory narrowing. Minor cadence hiccup in “her life’s ambition had crystallized” dips into tell, not show.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“sepia”, “sub-audible”, “flotsam of history”) carries archaic-bookish tinge appropriate to an heir. Rhythm swells with crank turns—sentence length mimics rising pressure. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly bounded (she must work to earn what reader finally sees). Read-aloud cadence varies; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person tight focalization stays inside Kaelen’s perceptual filter: articulated steel vs. puppeteers’ nimble ghosts. Syntax flexes from crystalline observation to compressed clause bursts under surge (“cold fire that scoured him clean”). No head-hops; diction remains within alchemical-engineer lexicon. The one filter-verb cluster (“he felt…he felt”) is brief enough to keep immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is saturated with archival diction—“brittle ledger,” “raking light,” “acid-free sleeve”—yet remains emotionally porous. Syntax elongates under melancholy, shortens under discovery, mirroring archival caution. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature is consistent: every detail is catalogued and emotionally priced simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter: she sees “vacuum where comrades used to be,” notices overdue library dates, never lectures us. Syntax tightens under pressure— clauses shorten as drones hum, then elongate in the starlit stillness. Lyric compression (“language of coded freedom, written in ephemeral ink”) is earned because the prior beats have taught the puddle cipher. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; even the broadcast flicker is kept at observable distance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: “pearlescent mist,” “mother-of-pearl keys,” “stone teeth.” Syntax lengthens during sustained notes, fragments when “coded sequence” intrudes. No head-hopping; knowledge strictly bound to him. The faint lyrical compression (“he descended, the world outside dissolving”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final “dissolving” of the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is tinker-specific (“measured his life in the quiet tick,” “sap translucent as amber”). Syntax mirrors his methodical patience—long vowel clusters, comma-joined clauses—then fragments under cavern awe. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“quenched coal,” “slag pedestal”) is character-specific, not encyclopedic. Syntax flexes—long furnace breath vs. fragmentary tremble—under pressure. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor stays physical (coin “pulses,” light “pours”). Voice never slips into allegorical lecture; perceptual signature is alchemist-cold yet grief-hot.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person poetic, steady cadence mirrors Silas’s calm; diction stays within his mystic-craftsman register. Perceptual signature—sound as shape, silence as texture—remains consistent. No dialogue, therefore no voice leakage; interiority is concrete. Filter verbs serve voice (“He let the vibrations guide him”) rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Kaelen’s somatic channel; diction never exceeds his enhanced but human lexicon. Rhythm mimics neural spikes—long sensory sentences cut by memory shards, no template cadence. Figurative language is biomorphic (light as weight, hum in molars) rather than poetic overlay, keeping voice character-bound. No dialogue, so no contamination; perceptual signature is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: smoke you “could almost hold,” “whisper-thin map of a dream,” lens “cool, familiar weight.” Rhythm modulates from languid market drift to crystalline “eternal instant” without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to distort; internal diction stays within an archivist-poet’s lexicon. Compression taught early (“elusively tangible like smoke”) pays off in closure’s translucent paint.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays inside Leo’s perceptual signature: “greasy guts of the lift mechanism,” “faint shimmering outlines,” “weightless burden.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“Silence crashed down”—then exhales with longer cadence after the find. No head-hop; ghost remains externality. Diction stays within a technician’s lexicon; no register drift into lyric purple.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient is kept at a cool, observational distance that matches the Operator’s affective flatness—appropriate texture for a figure who wants to annihilate time. Syntax is steely and periodic, mirroring the “precise and economical” movements described. Occasional lyric swells (“birth of a star, the last word of a dying god”) are earned by the conceptual stakes. No head-hop, no register drift; voice remains singular and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“chiseled spires,” “caesura in a line of forgotten verse”) is poet-scholar specific. Rhythm swells and subsides with storm intensity; no head-hopping. Velvet-over-mirror repetition is patterned, taught early, and paid off. Filter verbs serve voice: “he watched moments flicker” keeps reflective distance appropriate to aging observer.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptual filter—his noticing priorities are gears, acoustic feedback, temperature of the chip. Syntax lengthens during calibration work, then fractures into shorter units under the voice of rust, mirroring stress. No head-hopping; diction remains within a craftsman’s lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; the prose’s rhythmic control substitutes for spoken voice without flattening into monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person selective stays tight to Elara’s collector-perception; no head-hop. Diction—“petrichor,” “geologic hinge,” “aurora captured”—is within her lexicon. Rhythmic control: long sentences in cavern vastness, clipped fragments during psychometry strain. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy remains. Voice scales with pressure without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice carries sculptor’s perceptual signature: grain, burl, sea-castoff mythology. Syntax tightens under wave-threat—fragmented verbs, no filter clutter. “Turbine-hum reverie” and “timewoven” risk lyric neologism but pattern is taught early and echoed at close, earning consistency. No dialogue, so no register clash; internal lexicon stays within artisan range.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—light temperature, pane opacity, pigment memory—never generic. Syntax lengthens under contemplative beats, fragments under discoveries (“a second layer emerged”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Register stays within Elara’s artist lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Kaelen’s perceptual filter—brass vibration, salt sting, driftwood weight. Rhythm flexes from languid clause-strings inside reverie to staccato “He dismantled… He laid” at pivot. No head-hop; diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon without academic drift. Final coordinate decoding keeps psychic distance intact.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian with perceptual signature of antiquarian precision (“paper-thin wax cylinder phonograph shaving”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under shock (“A cold realization…”). No head-hopping; knowledge strictly bounded—he alone interprets the dead tongue. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence survives without it.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance that can dip into synesthetic perception (“scent of ozone from a grandfather’s strange experiment”). Syntax elongates during gathering beat, then shortens to single drop image—rhythmic mirror of inhale/exhale. Diction stays within gardener-caretaker lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Patterned repetition (“threads…threads”) is taught early and pays off in closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-loyal: “solstice hush,” “ferocious power,” “crystallized final moment.” Compression and lyric pattern are taught early (“wind that scoured the stone”) and paid off in the final hum. No dialogue to test, but interior monologue stays concrete and idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature: starlight “drifts,” silence “flourishes,” dust “whispers.” Syntax mirrors cosmic scale—long sentences for eons of cold, then fragmentary beats under frictional heat. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; diction remains within a custodian-poet’s plausible lexicon. Minor rhythmic over-indulgence in two successive “was not just…was not…” constructions, but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final negation “was not just dying,” keeping the slip sub-threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is beekeeper-poetic (wax-light, comb-cells) without purple drift. Syntax modulates—long laments vs. clipped “latch clicked.” No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Compression (“ghosts… dissolved like sugar”) is pattern-taught early and paid off. Unreliable self-knowledge (his “sacred gravity” belief) accrues subtly. Only hairline slip: “profound miscalculation” edges toward diagnostic label but is saved by ensuing embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Narrative distance stays tight third-person, filtering perception through Kael’s bone-light metaphor set. Syntax lengthens for obsession beats (“He would hold it for hours…”) then fragments at trigger (“Kael’s breath caught”). Diction remains within plausible post-Collapse lexicon—no academic register drift. No dialogue; therefore voice distinction bullet waived. Free indirect style cleanly handles internal chord-flood without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person ventriloquism of a quiet poet: diction (“salt-laced pages,” “burnished hush”) stays within his lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for lagoon calm, staccato “snap / tumble / drift” for kite rupture. No head-hopping; perception stays tightly focalized. Filter verbs serve voice: “his gaze coaxed” implies intentional attention, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person POV stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “calloused finger,” “worn boots,” metallic scent sharp to his nose. Syntax lengthens and relaxes during grafting, then compresses into single-clause beats as fatigue rises, mirroring bodily rhythm. No dialogue means the voice must carry all tonal modulation, which it does through shifting sensory hierarchy. The final hum is rendered with aurally onomatopoeic consonants—“low hum began, a vibration”—letting sound become the POV’s last perception.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “luminous skeptic,” “existential vertigo,” “psychogeographic resonance” are Aris’s native lexicon, never authorial intrusion. Syntax lengthens under intellectual pressure, then fragments at arrival (“a quiet click”). No head-hop; distance remains steady close-third. Rhythm modulates with weather and breath—drizzle sentences patter, tower sentences widen. Experimental compression (“dusty footprints left by people who weren’t entirely solid”) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person hovers at a liturgical distance, mirroring the coachman’s ceremonial precision; diction (“tabernacle,” “velvet pockets”) stays inside his lexicon of reverence. Rhythm lengthens during planting, then shortens to a quiet coda, echoing physical fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter—dust taste, loupe glare, moss warmth—without leakage into dog mind. Diction stays sparse, metallic, scavenger-apt: “hand-crank,” “husk of a city,” “iron bones sing.” Rhythm accelerates/shortens during decoding fatigue, then widens into cavern hush—intentional cadence shift. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue; narration owns consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person intimate maintains clean psychic distance; perceptual signature is character-specific—time is “syrupy,” silence is “a physical weight,” starlight “paints her face in ghostly light.” Syntax modulates: longer, liquid sentences during dilation, then staccato gasp at rupture. No head-hop; no filter-verb clutter. Free indirect style cleanly slips in “She felt that same yearning…” without announcing itself. Voice stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon yet achieves rhythmic distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual signature—“whisper-soft exchange,” “sterile antithesis”—with rhythmic compression under peak pressure; no head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter, and the final “soul lighter” cadence modulates voice to match release.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person tight stays inside Elara’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is theatrical—lights, acoustics, blocking—yet never clichéd. Compression is taught early: “nomadic penumbra” is legible twilight. Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences during the tear-streaked climax, then exhales with the groaning lock.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric glides into free-indirect without filter verbs: “her mind performed its harrowing trick.” Perceptual signature is mercury-silvered—fractured reflections, salt-spray, chill alpine air—never generic. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to clipped precipice beats (“This felt like the final precipice”) under pressure; zero head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—“fidget productively” is idiosyncratic and precise. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: long sentences for rumble of guilt, staccato “click” for breakthrough. No head-hopping; thunder and rain are external correlates, not POV slips. Register remains in character—no academic jargon intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers at cinematic distance yet filters every detail through Elara’s sound-shaping sensibility; perceptual signature consistent. Syntax warps with pressure—fragments mimic echo decay (“…a soul from death?…”)—teaching pattern early. Diction stays within plausible artist-poet lexicon; no register drift. Dialogue minimal but differentiated: Kael’s rasp vs Elara’s lilt. No head-hop. Rhythm controlled: nursery-rhyme cadence under threat heightens tension without obscuring causality. Meets 9+ hairline: one clause (“cosmic stakes”) momentarily over-asserts meta frame.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person POV remains stable, interior, and acid-pressurized. Perceptual signature is distinct: “screaming green tumult,” “quicksilver-infused binder,” “cartography of ruin.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences vs the staccato of micro-choices. No head-hopping; diction stays within alchemist-tinker lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual palette—color, light, surface—without leakage. Syntax lengthens and breathes in the oasis, then shortens at the drop: “He opened his fingers.” No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Diction remains within a coastal painter’s lexicon; no register drift. Patterned elision (the argument is lacquered over, never narrated) is taught early and paid off by the shell’s submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perception is colored by his scent-memory bias and lighthouse intimacy. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“He didn’t think of a ship…”) then widens to lyrical long sentences post-resolution, mirroring emotional dilation. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter verbs and therapy-speak. Voice distinctiveness peaks in the oxymoron “gentle scream,” whose risk pays off because it is immediately embodied as action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—starlight felt as solid, bronze weight as warm hum—remains consistent. Diction favors sibilants and low vowels that mimic wind moan, creating rhythmic cohesion. One compressed phone line—“grinding stars” static—teaches textured elision early and pays off in dish hum. No head-hopping; psychic distance shortens under pressure without syntactic fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: mycological diction (“symbiotic,” “Tuber melanosporum”), storm-light seen through apple blossoms, the eye’s “tiny radial lines.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short clauses during the ritual, mirroring stress. No head-hopping; neighbor’s dialogue is spare, utilitarian, distinct from lyrical interior. Register never drifts into academic filler.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Elias’s perceptual filter: “smudging the graphite,” “patience of a glacier,” “smelling of damp soil and something else… night-blooming jasmine.” Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates slightly inside the glowing cavern then settles into the long breath of the final paragraph. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Diction remains within the plausible lexicon of a solitary map-dealer who names terrain and light.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited holds tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “silk of her gloves as a shroud” is queenly yet claustrophobic. Syntax lengthens in grotto to mimic hypnotic drip, then snaps short at Kael’s intervention. No head-hop; Kael’s interior is conveyed only through gesture and voice hoarseness. Voice modulation tracks altitude: breath-starved diction at ridge, liquid cadence inside starlight chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited to Elara stays locked; perceptual signature steeped in alchemical diction—“ethereal physics,” “logarithmic spiral,” syntax rhythmic yet precise. Emotional modulation compresses diction under grief without voice drift. Dialogue minimal but differentiated; Kael’s hushed brevity counterweights her analytical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person lyric texture is sustained: crumbling charcoal “dry whisper,” “thick with dust motes,” rhythmic compression under trance. Perceptual signature—time-slippage, ranger’s geologic eye—remains consistent; no head-hop. Internal syntax frays slightly under stress (“yesterday and next week are bleeding”) yet stays legible. Final sentence cadence mirrors glide-path descent, reinforcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited clings to Elara’s tactile bias; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“liquid heartbeats,” “sterile gleam”). Perceptual signature is scentless—every observation is filtered through touch, sound, light, never smell. Rhythm flexes: long sentences for drip-time, staccato for screw revelations. Dialogue is sparse but voice-distinct—old man’s “spun-glass” thinness versus father’s brisk brass tone.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Elian’s perceptual signature: veins “pulsed with faint, cold light,” diction scholarly yet vulnerable.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Julian’s perceptual signature—his palm sweat, dental hum, taste of old arguments. Free indirect style is clean: “notes seemed to crawl” reflects his dread, not objective magic. Vex’s voice is sharply distinct—gravel wrapped in silk, occupational metaphor—without violating POV since Julian hears and filters her. No head-hop; oscillator dial twist is observed externally but through his bodily reaction, maintaining distance discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric maintains distance yet breathes through cadenced long sentences that mimic spiral motion. Perceptual signature is monk-librarian: every noticed detail (obsidian, creases, hush) is catalogic yet devotional. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction control—“wanderingly exact,” “universe’s hiccup”—which stays within lexicon of an archivist of silence. Rhythm swells then cuts off in the final fragment, mirroring absorption into hush.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is engineer-poet hybrid—precise gear-count next to “water sighing through copper pipes.” Diction remains within plausible lexicon: “geodetic arcs,” “obsidian razor edges,” yet never drifts into jargon for show.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature—“a lattice of forces, a symphony of pressures and vacuums”—maintained throughout; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors spatial mind: long Latinate clauses for lattice perception, then staccato “soft, definitive click” under stress. Diction stays within POV lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Compression taught early (“ghosts of a loss”) pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)

No head-hop; Tomas kept at observational distance. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within conservator lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Silas; perceptual signature is wry, logistics-tinged—“a joke that landed with the soft thud of moss on brick.” Syntax mirrors his cataloguing mind: short, tool-ready clauses when he catalogs parts; longer, looping sentences when he listens to the guitar. No dialogue is attributed to him, preserving his edge-of-circle stance. Register holds: “horologist” is justified by grandfather lore, not ivory-tower intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited adheres to Kaelen’s synesthetic perception; diction stays tactile (“cool whisper,” “vibration thinner than spider silk”). Rhythm accelerates with note-discovery, then widens into chordal cadence at closure. No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is cool, analytic, matching a signal-interpreter’s mindset. Diction tightens under pressure—short declaratives during edits, then longer reflective cadence at release. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested; internal voice stays coherent. One template run (‘He… then he…’) mid-text barely audible; rhythm otherwise controlled.

    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter; diction (“rippling sheet of silver,” “spectral symphony”) mirrors his musical synesthesia without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates in the final paragraph, mirroring the desperate ballet of hands. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. One minor echo—“silence” repeated eight times in 100 words—drops it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is analytical (“almost imperceptible shifts”) yet tender (“threads worn smooth as worry stones”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under rage—“Rage, hot and familiar, coiled...” No dialogue, so voice is carried by filtered perception and metaphor. Free indirect cleanly blends “he remembered” with sensory immediacy; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is musically tactile—everything is surface, vibration, shimmer.

Free indirect slips cleanly into sensation: “she felt the cool weight of his hand” reads as her fusion, not authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited hangs close to Silas, lexicon of maintenance and celestial navigation specific to his trade. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for climb, staccato for rivet code. Kaelen’s dialogue—"my grid is down…"—carries immediate goal and status bray, distinct from Silas’s sparse replies. No head-hop or register drift; prose stays inside plausible dock-worker diction.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distilled, ritualistic, almost incantatory—syntax elongates then contracts like breath, mirroring the "spiralingly calm" psyche. Perceptual signature favors optical minutiae (shutter-sliver angles, thumbnail mirror) over auditory detail, fitting a guardian whose tool is sight. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk; every descriptor is filtered through Kaelen’s patient gaze. Patterned repetition ("one slat… another…") is taught early and pays off in the beam-path release, satisfying lyric-mode rules.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—“he could feel them; he heard the unspoken words.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses at bell-strike, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests are waived. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and justified by his psychic attribute.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited hugs Kaelen’s senses: selective attention to rope texture, whalebone grooves, brine scent. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional swells—long, fluid clauses on dock, staccato whispers at root-snapping climax. Elara’s dialogue “You stare at the water…” carries subtext of fear disguised as scolding; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within dockhand lexicon. Only tiny slip: “conceptual repricing” register moment in “meaning I need” could sound more salt-crusted.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited clings so close to Elias’s perceptions that narration adopts his theatrical cadence in the mock-ceremony lines, then thins to stark fragments during whittling. Syntax mirrors attention: compound, performative sentences while “on stage”; short, blade-clean clauses when alone. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature (e.g., steam “the color of rust”) is idiosyncratic yet precise. Voice modulation under pressure—compression during kettle whistle, elongation during tea pour—demonstrates rhythmic control that heightens clarity rather than obscures it.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)

Dialogue is minimal but pitched correctly—her whisper is child-simple, contrasted with his crafted metaphor. Filter verbs appear only when they mimic a telescope’s mediation (“he saw her then”)—voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-close distance is stable; perceptual signature—“stresses and loads,” “lens magnifying”—is engineer-legacy specific. Rhythm modulates: long atmospheric sentences for rain, staccato card placements for ticks of contagion. No head-hop. Dialogue minimal but carries subtext: “why did we all believe so hard?” is genuine plea, not exposition. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she noticed,” “he felt”) and serve psychic distance shifts cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: academic precision (“fine silk a flimsy barrier”) collides with lyric compression (“atoms of nostalgia”). Rhythm accelerates during ritual—fragments, em-dashes, percussive verbs—then exhales into the long last sentence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Diction stays within scholar-lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person omnimodal ventriloquism perfectly calibrated to Kaelen’s sensorium: scientific lexicon (“wave functions,” “quantum ghost”) yet lyrical compression (“a fractured lullaby whispered to a feverish child”).

    Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual palette: “calloused but careful,” “captured twilight.” Syntax breathes with descent—longer sentences underground, clipped emergence. No head-hop. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Diction within rural-smith lexis; no sudden academic intrusion. Rhythmic control under pressure in memory-offer paragraph. Distinctive without mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Kael’s perceptual filter: syntax lengthens during shard-gaze, contracts to fragments at redirect. Diction stays within a technician-poet lexicon without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through sensory idiom. The shard’s “fractured” world-view recurs with shifting emotional color, proving rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Silas’s perceptual filter: storm spray tastes metallic, lens facets “absorb rather than refract.” Syntax tightens under duress—fragments mimic gasping climb. No head-hop; keeper’s vantage is only inferred. Diction is sailor-lean, never venturing beyond Silas’s plausible lexis. Rhythm modulates: calm opening cadence, staccato during repair, then quiet close-out that mirrors lamp’s renewed sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Kaelan’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: “language far older than the forgotten tongues of the last print newspaper,” “cathedral of light and shadow.” Syntax grows breathless under pressure—clause-stacking mirrors storm-chant. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; narrative voice sustains rhythmic propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person dye-master voice carries perceptual signature: loupe, vat, pigment, refraction—lexicon never drifts. Syntax breathes with observation—long calm sentences, then clipped “I think I understand” under stress. No head-hop; interior certainty matches sensory limits. Dialogue (two lines) carries indirection and subtext. Meets 9+ quick test: rhythmic control sustains valley-mist wonder without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance, diction precise yet modest (“basso complaint,” “dizzying fall”). Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Aris’s professional solitude. Rhythm accelerates only during dream-map projection, mirroring his frantic pencil. Voice never breaks POV modesty; no 9+ only because syntax stays safe—no signature fragmentation or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays close to Elara’s senses; no head-hop. Texture is horticultural–alchemical: “phosphorescence,” “Moon-Petal,” “silver-barked” delivered in rhythmic, slightly incantatory cadence that mirrors song-magic. Psychic distance compresses in the sun-birth moment—sentence fragments mimic orb’s pulse. Diction never exceeds keeper’s plausible lexicon. Dialogue absent, so no register conflict; narrative voice remains consistent, urgent, and character-tinged.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar: vellum scent as balm, clock voice “soft and deep,” Elara’s sorrow perceived as “gentle” before name or face. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at the click of the latch, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; even Elara’s grief is inferred through stance and book-clutch. One clause drifts toward editorial: “a testament to such nestled paradoxes”—minor register lift, but it recedes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays snugly inside Elara’s diction—mortar “gaps,” “headless statue,” “small trowel” mirror her gardener’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses under guard pressure (“This is thyme,”), mirroring physiological calm vs. guarded alert. Dialogue is minimal but sharp: guard’s flat bureaucratic opener contrasts with Elara’s teacherly attribution, instantiating status without exposition. No POV leakage; even the guard’s memory of Saturday queues is relayed strictly through Elara’s auditory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: noticing lens-gleam, breath-fog, ledger-glyphs—never external judgments. Syntax lengthens during methodical cataloguing, then fragments into staccato clauses (“Hold.” / “He stabbed…”) under pulse-urgency, teaching the rhythm early and paying it off at the screamed tone. Diction (“hoarfrost,” “aethelburg,” “luminous vow”) invents a cold-lexicon without slipping into purple excess. No dialogue = no voice-contamination risk.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction—“ghost in homespun,” “sycophantic laughter”—carries idiosyncratic rhythm without purple drift. No head-hops; Silas and Eva rendered only through Elara’s ears and eyes. Dialogue sparse but functional: Silas’s “little bird” and Eva’s hiss carry status cues. Recorder’s click and tossed fob provide the final percussive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s synesthetic register; diction stays within a field-scientist lexicon. Perceptual signature—taste as barometer—remains consistent, no head-hop. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks as storms converge, then breathes post-aurora. No dialogue to distort voice. Compression like “terrestrially cosmic” is pattern-taught early and paid off in auroral descent, so elision reads intentional, not opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—charcoal grit, crystal glint, tumbler clicks; syntax lengthens for awe, shortens for lock tension; no head-hopping, diction stays within his artistic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person focalization stays tight to Elian’s calligrapher eye: parchment smell, ink loops, seed surfaces “impossibly smooth.” Syntax remains calm and precise, mirroring his craft, then opens slightly at the arboretum reveal. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; diction stays within his plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays exterior yet adopts Elian’s silent rhythm—syntax grows spare, tactile, wind-shaped. No head-hop; the focalization is consistent, the diction precise to a craftsman who feels rather than speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is unmistakably machine: “memory banks,” “core processes,” “chassis,” yet capable of registering “ghost of her hand.” Syntax stays precise, telegraphic under overload—“processors scream with overload warnings”—then widens into one lyrical inhalation of outside air. No head-hop; Elara exists only as stored sense-data, keeping POV pure. The diction never drifts into human cliché; even “nostalgia” is diagnosed as glitch, maintaining robotic modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: worn silver, reedy hum, thumb-polished pattern. Syntax is clean, slightly antique cadence suits curator without drifting into purple. No head-hopping. Dialogue snippets carry subtext (Mrs. Petrov’s “key to her heart” is data and eulogy). Voice doesn’t modulate much under stress, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical, compression-heavy voice stays in Elara’s coder-poet idiom; patterned elision (“spun from threads only she could read”) is taught early and paid off in the poem-code closure, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the dance without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays locked inside Silas; perceptual signature is maritime and nocturnal—every noun carries brine or rust, every verb is a quiet tread. Rhythm modulates: long saline sentences versus the staccato of the spiral reveal. No filter-verb stacks; “he felt” appears once at the ghost-memory climax, justified by alien sensation. Diction never exceeds a keeper’s lexicon; “leviathan” and “divination” are occupational, not ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Clara’s perceptual grammar: sentences curl like plaster, verbs echo architectural decay (“wreathed,” “settling,” “whisper”). No head-hop; Elias’s interior is accessed only through Clara’s sensory inference until he speaks from the air, a reveal that fits the building-voice premise. Psychic distance compresses under pressure—“she had to interrogate the source” is the closest we get to her assertive interior. The lyric pattern of building-as-body is taught early and paid off in the final aerial-shift metaphor of falling stars as stories, keeping voice coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance, perceptual signature colored by skepticism and tactile wariness (“pearlescent curve cool,” “psycho-acoustics”). Syntax lengthens during memory flood, mirroring vertigo. No head-hop; knowledge stays character-bound. Free-indirect hesitation (“his skepticism screamed…”) enriches voice without filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent, so voice rests on idiosyncratic sensory diction; consistent, with rhythm modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is scalpel-precise (“color of pearl twilight,” “comma of liberation”).

Voice modulates from reverent to tremulous without register drift, achieving rhythmic control that heightens tension without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV remains tight third; no filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is musicianly: “shape of the silence,” “counter-melody to the universe’s low drone.” Syntax mirrors breath control—long clauses swell, then punctuate with single-word echoes (“Unfinished”). No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; internal monologue avoids therapy-speak. The elevated diction is justified by the cosmic scale she perceives.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: “breath-hollowed space,” “blue, million-year-old cold.” Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences for trance, staccato clauses when dream-cameos burst. No dialogue to distort voice. Poetic diction (“borrowed starlight”) is internally consistent with her vocation. Filter verbs serve trance logic, not timidity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen’s perceptual signature—professional mender’s eye for knot-equivalents in fireflies, moon shards, tea foam—creating distinct internal idiom. Diction within plausible lexicon: “scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity” read as philosopher-mender’s self-coinage, not authorial flourish. Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences on parapet, clipped fragments during meadow immersion, mirroring attention narrowing. No head-hopping, filter stacks, or register drift; voice compression under peak stress is purposeful and taught by early pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: “coated everything,” “groaned with fruit,” “greasy smear”—diction is precise, tactile, slightly clinical, matching the investigator’s temperament. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; psychic distance compresses naturally under the antenna climb. Voice distinction is high for a single-POV piece; rhythmic control is confident.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s synesthetic perception (“tasted of ozone and regret”). Cadence waxes lyrical under storm pressure, compresses during console action. Diction—“bruised-indigo,” “spectral ones”—is character-bound, not authorial flourish. No head-hop; filter verbs serve voice. Distinct texture sustains throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains perceptual signature: every noun is beach-worn, every verb low-tide hushed. Syntax elongates then contracts like breathing surf, teaching the reader to hear cadence as container. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Diction never exceeds a self-taught beachcomber’s lexicon; “pearlescent” is the lone near-poetic reach, justified as offering ritual benediction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is crystalline, metallic, rhythmic—matching an engineer who thinks in waveforms: “note in a symphony she had spent a lifetime learning to conduct.” Compression taught early (“economy born of endless repetition”) licenses later ellipses. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress—full sen­tences collapse into single verbless bursts (“a feeling of being torn apart…”). Lexicon stays within plausible technical range; “sonic absolution” risks coined grandiosity but is earned by dramatized mechanics. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during frequency lock, mirroring heart-rate spike.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person distant is consistent, but perceptual signature is sharp: Kaelen notices magnetic thrums, silver threads, chronometer ticks—horizon mapper’s sensory hierarchy. Syntax tightens under pressure: “A ripple…disturbed the water” chopped into monosyllabic beats matching the skipped heart. No head-hop; no filter-verb clutter. Voice modulation is purposeful—calmer exposition, staccato at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Elias’s perceptual filter: “watchfully calm precision,” “jolt went through him—not of electricity, but of sensation.” Syntax lengthens under stress then snaps to short clauses at the end, mirroring regained control. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within an investigator’s lexicon. Voice doesn’t quite achieve the idiosyncratic rhythmic signature required for 9+ but is consistently character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays close to Arthur’s perceptual filter: sacramental cadence, prison jargon, and mechanical metaphors mingle without register drift. Elias’s dialogue carries ex-con brevity (“We talk a lot about what we deserve…”), distinct from Arthur’s more formal interior monologue. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts naturally under the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Compressed, gear-greasy diction stays inside Kaelen’s tinkerer lexicon; sentence rhythm accelerates with file-cuts and rivet hits. “Metallic sculpture of a paradox” is the one allowed poetic flare because it’s earned by glyph vision. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulates to irreverent awe without losing tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature: numbers pulse like “whispers,” servers breathe “noise,” the patch is “cool” metal—every sensory pick is filtered through Elara’s hyper-attuned coder ear. Rhythm compresses under stress: “She clicked ‘forward.’ The data packet… shot out” — two paratactic punches that mimic the packet’s own velocity. Corporate jargon (“legacy stacks,” “recursive code loops”) is kept inside Elara’s professional lexicon and never flattens into exposition. Voice remains distinct even in the single line of dialogue, her steady lie sharpening against Kael’s bland circle.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited adheres to Kael’s perceptual signature: “calmly intuitive sense,” “cool and smooth in his palm,” vision-access described as passive reception. Syntax lengthens during visionary drift, shortens for public verdict, mirroring pressure. No head-hops; narrator knowledge never exceeds Kael’s. Lexical choices—“keening wind,” “shriek of rope fibers”—are idiosyncratic yet transparent. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “You severed the anchor-line” carries history, fear, status.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature attuned to sonic and tactile minutiae—“tasting of salt and diesel,” “rolling the parasol tip”—syntax lengthens and contracts with tidal rhythm. No head-hop; diction stays within Elara’s sensorium without academic drift. Compression in opening sentence (“come…not for the end, but for the overture to it”) teaches the reader to accept lyrical elision that pays off in final cadence. Voice modulates from exhausted sifting to wind-whipped affirmation without breaking atmospheric skin.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance anchored to Elias’s sensory filter. Diction—“fermented earth,” “skeletal structure of wood and glass panes”—is concrete, viticulturist-appropriate, rhythmically varied. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Metaphorical pattern (vine pairing = romantic incompatibility) is consistent, taught early, paid off in final re-seeing. Voice never drifts into editorial omniscience; inference stays modest. Texture is controlled, lyrical, with no syntactic loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through Kael’s “peripheral awareness” idiom.

The rhythmic control of long vowel echoes (“loom,” “cool,” “spheres”) mirrors the sonic theme.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: lavender scent as “gentle balm,” conveyor belt “silent,” vines “creep.” Syntax lengthens and softens in parallel with the calm demeanor, then shortens at the final latch—“The puzzle was solved.”—creating rhythmic closure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within the plausible lexicon of a contemplative archivist. The calm is not just labeled but enacted in cadence, earning the high-band mark.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close sustains Elias’s perceptual signature—lexicon of morphology, hush, prism, cadence—without drifting into editorial. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments during discovery (“A cough from 1892…”). No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Psychic distance tightens from “man folded into a question mark” to final crystallized poise.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person psychic distance remains tight to Silas; perceptual signature is synesthetic and rust-metallic (“vibration in his teeth”).

No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual lens: “sound of a leaf falling” as internal metronome, diction precise yet tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)

Rhythm tightens into staccato clauses during key-manipulation, mirroring her deliberate hand. No head-hop or filter-verb bloat; even the automaton’s perception is inferred through her hypothesis. Voice distinction is not tested (no dialogue), but internal signature is vivid and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Free-indirect diction—“shrewdly innocent gaze,” “cartography of his own failures”—sustains Elias’s medical precision salted with latent wonder, no POV slippage. Rhythm swells from long horticultural clauses to short percussive trowel-clinks, mirroring tension crest. No dialogue, so no register clash; perceptual signature (bone-setter’s anatomical cataloging) colors every hedge leaf. One minor cadence hiccup: triple “he could…” anaphora in paragraph three feels template-ish under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric close stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature—constellation kinship, grit under fingernails, cataract simile.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lens stays welded to Kaelen’s perceptual marrow: “listening not with his ears but with the resonant marrow of his bones.” Syntax lengthens during the pour, then compresses at ignition, mirroring starlight’s thread-to-flash arc. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within an alchemist’s lexicon without sliding into RPG manual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature—peripheral, metallic, patient; no head-hop. Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic sweep-and-dart of reflected light; diction favors metallurgical precision (“velvet cloth,” “spun silver”) true to locksmith vocation. No dialogue, so voice must carry subtext through imagistic beats—achieved. Register never drifts into faux-poetic; restraint itself becomes voice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person sustained psychic distance, yet diction is saturated with Kaelen’s tactile bias: "smooth stone he turned over in a mind," "starlight drilled through the rock."

Near 9+; minor over-adjectival (“rust-hued peace”) keeps it 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature filters every noticing through engineering logic—gradations, schematics, power flows. Syntax mirrors her mindset: parallel clauses (“redirecting flows…daisy-chaining…running”) mimic circuit diagrams. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. One register slip: “resurrect” for ceiling lighting is poetic intrusion; she’d likely think “activate.”

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)

    Third-person POV stays tightly bound to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: he “hypothesizes,” “whispers,” “theories,” never slipping into omniscience. Syntax grows shorter, almost breathless as the crack appears: “He watched, breath held so tight his lungs burned.” No dialogue = no voice convergence risk. Diction remains within a prince’s ruined education—latinate “filigree,” “orrery,” but also tactile “salt-rimed,” “scraped.” The rhythmic crescendo matches the egg’s final tap, a taught pattern paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is firefighter-lean: “slow, silent migration of clouds” reads as smoke plume mirror; “deep, weeping gashes” is structural-fire diction.

Red thread image recurs with shifted charge, showing pattern control. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—“realistically imaginative mind” dictates the diction of “dormant machine” rather than spell. Sentence rhythm accelerates with each micro-rotation, mirroring her narrowing focus. No filter-verb stacks; light “streams,” colors “bleed,” the click is “felt,” maintaining immediacy. Voice distinctiveness slips only once with “tremor in her soul,” a faint cliché that recovers instantly in the goose thunder.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is cosmic-sentimental yet precise: “gossamer veils of hydrogen and helium” keeps the diction within Xylar’s expanded lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for drift, staccato “ping” repetitions for search beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Xylar’s empathy-sense. Filter verbs (“Xylar perceived”) are few and motivated by the alien sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays stone-carver-close: syntax favors chisel-taps, tactile verbs, muted palette. No head-hop; grandmother’s voice is inference only.

Psychic distance is clean: we are never told more than his tools and fingers can know.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close sustains disciplined psychic distance; register stays within Kaelen’s scholarly diction yet pulses with kinetic verbs (“piercing,” “plunged”).

Syntax lengthens during transcription, then fragments when the broadcast crackles, mirroring attention shifts. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Elias’s professional eye. Voice modulation under pressure is subtle but present: the lyrical lift in “teach dust to tell stories” is earned by the quiet accumulation of ritual detail.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Narrative distance remains steady in close-third, filtering every detail through Elara’s curator-biased perception—she notices “charcoal dust and old paper clinging like a second skin.” Diction is specific and occupational: “brazier,” “taper,” “earthenware urn” locate us inside her ritual lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is a controlled lecture-hall cadence laced with subterranean grit: “abrasive calm” is not a label but a syntactic signature—measured clauses, no exclamation marks, Latinate nouns dropped into sewer muck. Perceptual signature is exquisite: Silas hears “rhythmic drip” as metronome for thought, sees “breathtakingly fine pitch” in a thumbnail wheel. No head-hop; the girl’s interior is only inferred through her hug and step-back, keeping focalization pure. Compression is taught early (“grand gallery”) and paid off in the velvet-lined reliquary.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is patient, autumnal, slightly elegiac (“slow, magnificent decay”). Syntax varies; no drumbeat patterns. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (“We will not sing a single word”). Filter verbs are sparse; diction remains within Elias’s plausible lexicon. The only compression is the quick cut from library to rehearsal, but the transition is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight, chef’s perceptual signature—flavors as memory, synaptic soup, chlorophyll as conscience. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Snip. He tasted…”) echoing surgical urgency. No head-hopping; diction stays within culinary lexicon. One near-template cadence in the pruning sequence is noticeable but voice-motivated.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong density—most lines perform double duty (taste + memory + moral judgment). Occasional stacked metaphors (“physical manifestation of a society’s traumatic decline”) verge on purple but fit the lyric mode. Minor paraphrase loop in “He tasted… Snip.” triad; clarity intact. Final image is clean, luminous, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at Silas’s shoulder, filtering dusk through ozone and lacquer gleam—perceptual signature is consistent. Diction stays inside his lexicon: “syrupy, nectar dusk” reads as his sensuous defiance of sterile jargon. No dialogue over-articulate; Lena’s lines are worn thin, functional. Rhythm climbs and subsides with the matchbox reveal, no drumbeat templates. One hairline slip: “tasting of ozone and the last of the day’s pollen” edges toward tourism, but forgiven because taste is the story’s first sensory hook.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Free-indirect texture is consistent: “salt-heavy air smelled of mud and nascent blossoms,” “fashionable contagion” reflect Elara’s educated, sensory bias. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for dawn bleed, clipped for heart hammer. Compression is taught early (“a shard of hush inserted”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is specific enough to separate her from generic flaneur.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person internal stays tight to Mara; diction—“foxglove-stained glass,” “sculpted stone and patient coral”—is POV-colored perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV maintains steady psychic distance aligned to Elian’s analytical remove; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—mathematical nomenclature, geometric metaphors, sterile sensory filtering—remains consistent even at rupture moment. Syntax mirrors mindset: long, clause-heavy sentences for proofs, then staccato observations during rupture. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk null. Free indirect thought clean; diction stays within plausible autodidact lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks at “Seven.” single-word paragraph, ear-tested and justified.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “ochre and burnt sienna pooled” is painter-vision; “saffron quiet” is his chromatic lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally under stress—single participial phrase “breath catching” amid short sentences. Distinctive rhythmic cadence in “waxing moon fought its way through the chemical haze” teaches pattern early and holds. Minor over-adjectival drift (“soft, apologetic glow”) nicks the 9+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited stays locked to Alistair’s curator sensorium; perceptual signature is color-filter, archival cross-reference, and sculptural vocabulary. Rhythm modulates from elegiac opening to urgent imperatives at climax. No dialogue, so voice carries all exposition without strain. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels like rubric intrusion, not character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is maker-specific—“perfect tolerance” of gear-fit, “ozone and cold brass.” Syntax ripples under pressure: clauses shorten as lever descends. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs minimal; “he felt” is earned as bodily change. The lyric cadence of backward clocks is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final silent sweep—meets 9+ quick test, capped only by a single adverbial cluster (“quietly, silently”) that briefly flattens rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person voice owns a narcotic, paradox-drunk cadence (“silken scrape,” “cloying companion”) that modulates into stripped clarity at climax. Perceptual signature stays photographic—everything is seen in after-images and reflections—without ever naming the mechanic. No head-hop; advisor’s voice is diegetically external. Syntax tightens under stress: final paragraph trades clauses for blunt beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Kai’s perceptual signature—”clouds whispered of a coming dissonance,” “fractal generating patterns”—maintaining synesthetic bias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: geological diction (“skeletal dome,” “new fissure,” “datum points”) and tidal rhythm (long sentences on calm water, clipped fragments during surge). No head-hopping; even the inkwell is focalized through his palm-weight and temperature. Psychic distance tightens from panoramic marsh to knuckle-scrape immediacy without register drift. The prose’s cadence mimics surveyor patience, then heart-beat staccato underwater, then slowed polish in the hut—voice as character physiology.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s tranquilly perceptive filter: “tranquilly perceptive” is not told but enacted in the steady, unsentenced noticing of condensation drip and moss glow.

Diction stays within drowned-archivist lexicon: “cartouche,” “kelp-vellum,” “frond-symbol” feel organic, not glossary items. Zero head-hop; no POV leakage even at peak discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate sustains lyrical compression: “descends while ascending” teaches paradox pattern early, paid off in mirrored descent.

Register never drifts into academic abstraction; diction remains within his plausible intellect.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person tight stays strictly inside Elias’s perceptual filter: “mist tasted of salt,” “gloved hand worried brass.” Syntax lengthens under stress—subordinate clauses mirror his weighing of Kaelen’s tremor. Dialogue is minimal, all subtext: “The lockbox” = I’m ready if you are. No head-hopping; Kaelen’s interiority is inferred only through observable tremor, preserving distance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s salt-bitten perceptual lens; diction (“phantom helm,” “keel broken on the shores of what should have been”) is navigator-poetic yet precise.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Silas; perceptual signature is architectural—“cataloguing failures,” “blueprint for what could be.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at the intrusion—“his breath caught.” Dialogue is minimal, idiomatic, and goal-driven: Elara’s “Time to plant the garden” carries double meaning without exposition. No head-hopping; the young woman’s voice is reported, not interiorized.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet piano-precise: phrases like “silvered sorrow” and “sonic key” extend metaphor but remain rooted in Elian’s perceptual world. Rhythm mirrors musical cadence—crescendo syntax, arpeggio sentence crest—without drowning clarity. No filter-verb clusters; every perception is an action (“let his fingers drift,” “studied the sequence”). Distinctive idiom holds under pressure; even the single abstract noun “longing” is alloyed to “steely,” keeping it specific.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid (“riot of impossible blues,” “internal pulse…in her bones”).
