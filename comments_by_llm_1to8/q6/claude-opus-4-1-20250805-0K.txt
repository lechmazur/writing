    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and Elena's perceptual signature shows in how she processes the greenhouse through her physics background ("gravitational lensing effects," "fractal patterns"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract register ("preprocessed reality without mathematics as an intermediary") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception focused on artistic details and material properties. The perceptual signature of an artist noticing patterns and transformations is distinct. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she thought") slightly dull immediacy in reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains lyrical precision with scientific grounding ("62 Hz," "432 Hz fork," "two degrees Celsius"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Mira experiences the world through vibration and temperature rather than sound. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("prismatic symphonies," "crystallized breath") but mostly serve the piece's textural accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, literary register appropriate to the material, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("rainbow ghosts," "crystallized into something he could inhabit"). The perceptual signature of an undertaker viewing everything through death-work holds throughout. However, syntax becomes uniform in longer passages, and the Sleepless Librarians' dialogue lacks distinction from narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent formal register with selective details like "terra-cotta arbor" and "antique silver bell" creating texture. Dialogue feels natural ("From someone who remembers hunger"). Some filter verb clusters ("she discovered," "she found") and occasional register elevation ("benevolent shadows") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive mystical voice with controlled rhythm ("phosphorescent trail that only the spiritually curious could see") and effective modulation during revelation sequences. The ghost's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly register, though some phrases like "foggy lucidity" and "spiritually curious" edge toward abstraction rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's designer's eye viewing time spatially ("passages that led both forward and backward") and the controlled rhythm accelerates toward dissolution, though some passages drift into elevated register ("quaking reverie of creation"). The lyric compression serves the accumulative mode effectively despite occasional opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the stakes, with selective perception focused on Marcus's escape tools and seed knowledge. Some diction occasionally drifts toward abstract ("confluence of circumstances," "imperceptibly filing") without full POV grounding. Narrative distance remains stable, though interiority sometimes tells what could be shown ("Marcus knew better").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthesia ("heard it as rainfall on leaves"). Voice maintains poetic control under pressure with purposeful compression ("Hours passed, maybe days"). The scientific-lyrical register fits Elena's designer-granddaughter duality. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"emerald-tiled walls gleamed like scales," "amber glow from sunset photographs." The perceptual signature of someone who thinks in terms of light and its capture is consistent. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in phrases like "archaeology of light" that momentarily drift from the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina's self-narration creates a distinct perceptual signature—she sees the world through the lens of craft and transformation ("blue at its heart, like hope itself"). The ritualistic commentary maintains consistency while revealing character through what she chooses to narrate. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with the couple's "Is it safe?" carrying appropriate subtext about more than physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with evocative phrasing like "metal's chill seep through his skin like a promise" and "a sound like grinding metal." POV remains stable in close third. Dialogue serves multiple functions - Jake's "A stunt double seemed poetic" reveals cruel calculation while advancing plot. Minor register drift in technical passages ("synthetic memory compounds") that briefly breaks voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through the oracle's synesthetic perception ("marble the air, creating veins of sound through silence") and her unique attention to varieties of darkness. The lyric compression serves the contemplative mode, and specialized vocabulary ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") creates consistent texture without obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Seven's mechanical precision ("optical sensors registered," "neural networks amalgamating") creates a convincing AI consciousness voice. The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation and wonder, maintaining POV consistency even through philosophical revelations, though some passages drift toward elevated register beyond Seven's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent close third POV with Mira, distinctive perceptual signature in how she reads Samuel's doodles and notices acoustic properties. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I kept it" implying deeper meaning). Some register drift into elevated literary language ("architectures of protection") not fully aligned with character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific register with purposeful technical precision ("magnetic nexus," "holographic principles") that reflects Ira's expertise. The perceptual signature shows through selective attention to electromagnetic phenomena others miss, though dialogue lacks distinct character differentiation between Ira and Vasquez.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("like a patient dog," "peculiar purgatory"). Some register elevation in places ("architects never imagined") but generally consistent. The absence of dialogue works for the "wordless conversation" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with scientific precision ("magnetometer," "electromagnetic bath") balanced against poetic perception. POV control is strong—we know only what Mira experiences. Perceptual signature is distinct in how she processes multiple truths simultaneously.

    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm: "She gripped reality loosely these days, understanding that truth bent like light through water." The perceptual signature—seeing decomposition as transformation—remains distinct. Some passages edge toward elevated diction ("perpetually transformed," "eternal regenerative silence") that slightly exceeds the meditative POV's natural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains Elena's therapist perspective with consistent psychic distance and selective perception ("cautious exuberance," musical metaphors). Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("For the eclipse. Bring what started everything"), though brief. Some filter phrases ("Elena understood," "she felt") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Thrain's tactile sensitivity ("fingers trailing along spines that remembered being trees") and selective attention to whispers and impressions. Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression, though occasional register drift ("existential axis") momentarily breaks the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Chen sees fortunes as musical notation, notices the lighthouse's rhythm. The prose modulates effectively with emotional beats, though occasional register elevation ("transpose their lives into new keys") slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus's perceptual signature—hearing architecture in sound, understanding emptiness as truth—remains distinct throughout, with controlled modulation during the exorcism sequence. The dialogue between Marcus and the possessed woman carries subtext effectively, though some philosophical abstractions ("what assumes that assumption itself cannot be assumed away?") slightly strain naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice modulates from contemplative to urgent as exhaustion approaches, with syntax mirroring temporal folding ("forward and backward simultaneously"). The perceptual signature—seeing time as shattered reflections—remains consistent while allowing lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and strong perceptual signature ("between the drop and the ripple"), though occasional register drift into abstract philosophical language ("labyrinth of self," "quantum foam") slightly undermines POV consistency. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the merging sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through tactile sensation replacing auditory ("fingers reading the air's subtle pressure changes"), with controlled lyric compression in passages like "the symphony written in stone and skin." Some filter verbs ("she felt it then") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV maintains Elena's scientific precision throughout—"documented seventeen major storm systems," "barometric pressure gauge carefully." Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to charged realization without losing its measured quality. The brief dialogue in notes maintains subtext effectively. Slight register elevation in "tyranny" and "revolution" doesn't quite match Elena's otherwise grounded lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with phrases like "trafficking in the light of lost things" and controlled psychic distance. Some moments of elevated diction ("aromatically cautious," "temporal echoes") occasionally drift from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with poetic sensibility: "Time had texture here, rough like the rope's weave." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("cosmic scales that could never be balanced") beyond Marcus's established roadside poet lexicon. The abstract interiority sometimes tells what could be shown through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with musical metaphors naturally embedded ("notes that seemed to rise from the greenhouse itself"). POV remains stable with Mara's acoustic perception filtering observations. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("mendicant's bowl," "chronic hush") slightly strains against more grounded character moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Vera reads emotions through static discharge. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("molecular structure loosening") that slightly exceeds the established voice's naturalistic range.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.7)
    Margot's perceptual signature filters everything through commerce—"tallying manifests," "broker," "personal cargo," "currencies beyond calculations"—until this lens expands to include human exchange. Prose rhythm accelerates during discoveries and slows for reflection, supporting emotional beats. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb clustering ("she discovered," "she initiated") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited through Kira with selective, poetic perception ("crystalline orchard trembled with morning light"). Dialogue effectively distinguishes Tomás's warning tone from Kira's optimistic certainty. Some register elevation in peak moments ("luminescent ache") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled diction ("temporal naturalist," "sculptable") that fits the world.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's exhausted perception colors descriptions effectively ("fingers still gripped," "tongue heavy"). Dialogue carries subtext well, particularly "You're late" when she's on time. Some filter phrases ("Mara understood then") and occasional register elevation ("liquified time") create minor friction with the otherwise grounded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with lyrical passages like "crystal formations sang their ancient harmonies" and controlled rhythm during Vera's expansion sequence. The shadow-entity's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldliness. Minor register drift when narration slips into explanatory mode ("Magic wasn't in the dramatic prophecies...") that doesn't match Vera's established perceptual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism: "ocean-spray archivist," "navigated absences," "topology of loss and return." Some register elevation in passages like "palimpsests where one story had been written over another" that slightly exceeds Kessa's established lexicon but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct voice with cartographer's perception ("tracing the cracks," "meticulously drawn maps"). Controlled psychic distance shifts from external observation to internal recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Mari's ability to feel memory's texture on objects and navigate by echo patterns. Controlled psychic distance shifts during the annotation discoveries. Minor dialogue integration feels natural with proper subtext ("Living there for months before anyone noticed").

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina's perceptual signature shows through her investigative habits (humming unconsciously, myth-busting instincts flaring) and professional skepticism yielding to wonder. Dialogue between Marina and Claudia feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some filter phrases ("Marina understood suddenly") could be stronger, and occasional register elevation ("repository of human longing") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Maya reads walls and navigates platforms "with practiced ease." Voice maintains consistent register though peaks toward mild elevation ("ungoverned and ungovernable"). Some filter-verb clustering ("Maya watched," "Maya stood," "Maya began") reduces immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("pregnant and blue," "dawning hush"), though register occasionally elevates beyond Vera's technical background. Some passages drift toward essay voice ("The space age would continue, perhaps, but not like this") rather than maintaining embodied perspective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya's POV maintains consistent focus on tactile and auditory perception, with phrases like "whispered their locations through altered resonance" staying true to her blindness. Dialogue between Maya and Chen feels natural if somewhat functional. Minor dock for Chen's overly convenient setup questions ("How do you oversee such delicate work while blind?").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.7)
    Margot's perceptual signature shows in how she reads frost patterns, bird gestures, and condensation as data. Her dry wit ("Well, that's almost too convenient") maintains consistent voice under pressure. Dialogue between Margot and inspector carries strong subtext about trust and shared purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition ("infinitely patient" echoes effectively). The bell tuner's dialogue maintains consistent riddling quality ("Your town stutters"). POV remains stable in limited third, though perceptual signature could be more distinctive—whose consciousness filters these observations isn't always clear.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific precision mixed with wonder, appropriate for Maya's cartographer role. Perceptual signature strong in passages like "mathematics of impossibility."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains fairy-tale register appropriately ("Devil's Tooth Reef," "Marcus True-Tongue"). POV stable with controlled psychic distance. Some moments of elevated diction ("amber repose") fit the mythic tone. Minor deduction for occasional telling over showing and some filter phrases that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with gothic register ("ashen-veil ghost bride," "ephemeral cameos") and controlled rhythm especially in dialogue. The ghost's speech carries appropriate otherworldliness. Minor issues with register elevation in places ("particular joy of greeting something beloved yet poisonous") that slightly exceed the POV's established range.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.7)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency through selective perception focused on weaving metaphors and tidal rhythms, with purposeful compression around the sleepwalking paths that pays off when revealing the golden spiral pattern. Diction like "wharf weaver," "phantom stitches," and "orchids—rare, delicate, and impossibly alive" creates distinct texture though occasional elevation ("frequencies only she could hear") slightly strains the register.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that modulates during discovery moments. Perceptual signature emerges in how Miriam notices death-life intersections ("pomegranates splitting against marble angels").

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Vera processes the world through textile metaphors and mnemonic melodies. Dialogue effectively carries dual registers—her performed fool's speech versus internal precision. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strays from Vera's established lexicon ("hemoglobin code," "synchronize their charts").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice blends mystical perception with emotional specificity ("where roots twisted like frozen screams"). The narrative distance modulates effectively from external ritual to intimate confession. Minor register elevation in places ("elastic and patient") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon but doesn't harm comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature through morphine-filtered awareness and translator's attention to language patterns. Dialogue between Maya and child feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some register drift into elevated diction ("convolutions," "collaborative art") that doesn't fully match the intimate, wounded POV established earlier, and brief head-hop to child's "shrewdly innocent gaze."

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity ("Light began pooling in her palms, golden and warm as summer honey"). The dreamlike register fits the liminal space between waking and sleeping.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through emotional longing ("Marina traced the gauge's crystalline face"). The perceptual signature is distinct - seeing mathematics in nature, equations in spirals. Some passages drift toward explanatory register ("The disappearance hadn't been accidental"), but overall the voice sustains its unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature of someone attuned to acoustic memories and physical vibrations. Voice modulates appropriately with discovery and maintains distinct texture, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("eternal collection") that slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya's perceptual signature is distinct—she sees "rainbow fragments trapped" and paints "dusky harmony" between states. Voice modulates effectively from calm observation to urgent creation. The brief dialogue (sung lullabies) carries crucial subtext about finding doors "painted spring," though more varied syntax under pressure would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("dark-bodied and heavy, moving like grief itself") and effective modulation during Mara's speech. Some register elevation in phrases like "infinite grief" and "certified hatred" that slightly exceed the POV's established lexicon.

Some elevated diction ("infinitesimal pause contained lifetimes") occasionally drifts from character register, but perceptual signature remains consistent in how Lyralei reads bodies and threads as texts.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice has distinct texture with phrases like "cathedral echo" and "meteor hush," maintaining consistent psychic distance. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("manufactured consent," "subversive act") that feels more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Mira's esoteric knowledge—reading atmospheric currents, understanding moth-scale messages. Some register drift into elevated literary diction ("transiently rooted," "systematic erasure") that occasionally distances from immediate experience. Voice maintains consistency but lacks the rhythmic variation that would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision befitting a lost wax caster, with selective perception focused on materials and transformation. Some passages drift into elevated register ("ghost-echo of that long-ago street organ") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon, and occasional filter constructions ("She understood now") dull immediacy.

    Voice maintains lyrical precision with phrases like "exhaled centuries of silence" and "cathedral rays." The perceptual signature stays consistent—Kira experiences time as layered certainty. Minor weakness in dialogue-free narration that occasionally drifts toward explanatory register during the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the material, with selective perception focused on astronomical and architectural details reflecting Mara's expertise. Rhythmic control evident in the building cadences toward revelation. Some filter-verb clustering ("she understood," "she felt") in middle sections slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    The mystical register maintains consistency with phrases like "reality bent like water around stones" and "ghost of its lost melody," though some passages drift into overly abstract territory ("existed in fragments across timelines"). The soundless sanctuary conceit justifies the lack of dialogue while touch-based communication creates unique narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice through Elara's craftsperson perspective—"fingers reading the curve of glass the way others might read braille." Clean free indirect style and consistent POV.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through scientific precision ("coordinates etched...in microscopic script") meeting poetic observation ("blossoms fell upward").

    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm—"The pause that followed wasn't silence—it hummed with the susurration of retreating waves." Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Chen's "Do you know why cicadas?" Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("susurration," "calcium cities") slightly above character lexicon but maintains consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent wonder-tinged precision with phrases like "inverted mountains" and "liquid starlight" that feel earned rather than overwrought. POV holds steady through Mira's specific perceptual signature - a collector's taxonomic attention to silence varieties. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("xenial sanctuary") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus's perceptual signature focuses on acoustic subtleties and atmospheric pressure changes others can't feel, creating a distinct professional expertise.

The narrative distance remains stable in close third, with syntax appropriately slowing during contemplative moments and tightening during navigation sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with effective free indirect style ("They chose not to rule," Anya murmured). Perceptual signature shows in details like "rainbow fractals dance across her environmental suit's visor," though some passages drift into elevated register ("the future's memory of a past") that slightly exceeds Anya's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with distinctive perceptual signature—"charcoal pillars rose like burnt fingers against starlight."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent archival perception ("dust had its own language," "reading the accumulation like braille"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Marcus notices what others overlook (faint pencil notes, dust patterns).

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception reflecting Mira's focus on light and reflection ("reading the language of reflected light," "star-map in the water").

    Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's professional attention to spectral states and Thomas's musician-specific focus on sound. Dialogue carries subtext ("what if the bride preferred it that way?"). Minor register elevation in "achingly luminous" doesn't match established voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through enhanced proprioception creates a unique POV filter ("could feel every nerve ending, every muscle fiber, the exact angle").

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with musical/mechanical lexicon ("sympathetic vibrations," "mainspring," "resonance chamber") that fits the repairman POV.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("collection vials clinking softly"). Free indirect style is clean and psychic distance modulates appropriately during the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third person maintains Marina's perspective consistently, with her perceptual signature evident in how she reads wood and weather. Voice modulates effectively during the carving sequence, though some passages drift into elevated register ("history's expanse," "origami") that doesn't fully align with Marina's established lexicon. The prose rhythm successfully mimics the storm's "turbine-hum" during key passages.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "The pavilion transformed under her hands." POV remains stable in close third, with Mara's artistic perception filtering details like "pigments that seemed to shift in the dying light."

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the archival perspective, with selective perception focused on documents, symbols, and historical weight. Dialogue between Amara and Marcus serves the conceptual exchange but lacks naturalistic texture—"The truth creates tension" reads more as thematic articulation than organic speech, though this fits the story's allegorical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward exposition ("Other alchemists scorned his work"). The perceptual signature of an exiled alchemist comes through in how he reads essence and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira's perceptual signature filters everything through botanical and temporal metaphors ("velvet worn smooth," "entropy from chaos"), maintaining consistency even under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice emerges through technical precision ("electromagnetic pulses," "mathematical patterns") filtered through mystical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct academic voice with controlled elevation ("luminous skepticism," "bronze quiet") that mostly maintains POV consistency. Dialogue feels slightly stilted ("The chemistry of homecoming") but carries subtext about their rivalry's irrelevance. Some register drift toward corporate in "spectral analysis revealed synthetic polymers" without full POV grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the coachman reads gull patterns, translates extinct languages, understands phosphorus rising from coral. Voice modulates effectively from practical ("knelt among the roses") to lyrical ("narrow vastness"). The consistent focus on translation and interspecies communication creates a unique POV filter throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Sage's scent-based cognition ("no longer trusted her nose") and the synesthetic translation of grooves into color-tinted meaning.

Minor deductions for occasional register elevation ("scripture," "mythology") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("moments folded inside moments") and technical precision. The perceptual signature—Kira experiencing time differently—is consistent throughout. Some filter verbs ("she could glimpse") slightly dull immediacy in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct narrative voice balances lyrical descriptions ("colors that shouldn't exist") with grounded action. The Keeper's voice ("like wind through icicles") contrasts effectively with Renn's more embodied perception. Minor filter verb clusters ("Renn recognized," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy in transition moments but don't compromise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina's perceptual signature—noticing architectural acoustics, small gestures, absences—remains consistent and character-specific. The walking-writing device creates distinct rhythm. Dialogue (brief but present) carries subtext when the other survivor calls. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through blindness—trailing fingers on spines, feeling stories through bindings, sensing the stone's message "like the texture of a feather."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("fierce repose," "winnow truth from possibility"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with discovery, though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("temporal prison") that slightly exceeds Kaspar's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception (Kira notices acoustics others miss). The prose modulates effectively—whispers becoming stronger voice as the rebellion builds.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Mara's grief-filtered awareness (lighthouse's "ancient pulse," Thomas as "shimmer"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from established register ("molecules of intent," "dimensions on frequencies"). Voice maintains consistency through emotional peaks with controlled modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina's voice maintains consistent texture through selective perception ("scarred hands trembling," "poisoned corridor") and dialogue that carries subtext of false hope ("They'll return by morning"). The cryptic midnight instructions feel authentic to emergency communication, each line pursuing the goal of survival guidance. Minor slip in "raw certainty" feels slightly elevated for the established register, but overall the piece sustains its worn, pragmatic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective detail ("verdigris," "mortar and pestle") though occasional overwriting appears ("fractured grace," "hanged men"). POV control is solid with no head-hopping, but some filter constructions ("she watched") slightly dull immediacy during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with phrases like "nautical twilight" and "softly persistent silence." The perceptual signature of noticing gaps and timing patterns reflects Magnus's lighthouse-keeper precision. Minor repetition of "softly persistent" works thematically but slightly dulls freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("dusty shop," "empirically intuitive nature") and modulates effectively from melancholic opening to crystallized ending. The grandfather's dialect "follow the ants home" distinguishes generational voice, though Marcus's internal register could vary more under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled imagery like "silk drawn across broken glass" and "roses bloomed backwards into buds." Some register elevation in places ("monuments to some ancient burning") slightly strains the POV's natural diction, but the perceptual signature remains consistent through Seraphina's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Lyra experiences the nexus ("dying heart at twilight") and scientific romanticism.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with phrases like "time had become negotiable" and "feral nostalgia." POV distance modulates effectively between intimate reflection and wider temporal perspective. Some passages edge toward overwriting but remain character-motivated by Maya's fractured perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice through Mara's tactile perception and measured prose rhythm matching the water clock's tempo. Clean POV control with effective free indirect style. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext though occasionally edges toward articulating theme too directly ("Your grief did the same thing").

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature with Kira experiencing stress as crystallization rather than conventional responses. Voice modulates effectively from controlled observation to oxygen-starved revelation. Minor dialogue between Kira and Master Yuen carries appropriate subtext, though limited exchange prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style. Dialogue carries subtext effectively (Marcus's "You've been ripping spirits out like weeds").

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") and purposeful paradoxes that serve the spiral concept. Some elevated diction ("euclidean reason," "möbius strip") fits the scholarly POV but occasionally drifts toward academic register in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision with poetic undertones ("fjord stretched in perfect stillness, its surface holding the mountain's reflection like mercury"). The counting sequence creates rhythmic propulsion. POV stays cleanly limited to the shepherd's perception with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya's technical POV filters perception effectively ("mycorrhizal networks," "quantum tunnels"), though some phrases feel elevated beyond her voice ("constellation beneath the earth"). Dialogue sounds natural and carries subtext. Minor register drift in philosophical moments ("fundamentally alien," "patient heat") that doesn't quite match the technical specialist's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent academic-poetic register with distinctive perceptual signature ("rivulets trace equations she'd never solve"). Dialogue between Elena and stranger carries appropriate subtext about shared loss. Minor convergence in their speech patterns docks points, though the mirroring may be intentional given their parallel experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with Marcus experiencing time as loops and frequencies. The voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression. Dialogue between Marcus and Eleanor carries appropriate subtext. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in passages like "liminal space" that doesn't fully match Marcus's working-class position.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through Sadie's "desperately jocular" register and specific diction like "disaster-relief logistician extraordinaire and professional ghost." Dialogue carries strong subtext, particularly "Everything worthwhile is technically illegal." Minor convergence in the philosophical exchanges doesn't significantly harm the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression and controlled rhythm, particularly in "the pause of shifting constellations, in that breath between stellar movements." Some elevated diction ("ultrasonic architecture") occasionally drifts from embodied perception. Strong perceptual signature through blind navigation and tactile language-absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct voice with scientific register appropriate to Mira's role, though some passages drift into overly explanatory mode ("Not rewriting the past, but revising how the universe presented its own story"). The perceptual signature of a signal interpreter seeing patterns everywhere is consistent. Minor register inconsistencies in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Maya experiences the world through visual music—"Listen with your eyes," framing "silence through its viewfinder." Sign language dialogue creates unique texture. Minor wobble in register when narration explains Maya's historical significance rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "surgically precise" and "volcanic tenderness" that suit Mira's analytical-artistic fusion. The controlled, distant register matches her isolation, though peak moments could benefit from more syntactic variation to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through musical/acoustic vocabulary and the specific way Mira notices frequencies and resonances. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the transition to the shared consciousness space. Some register elevation in peak moments ("ineffable quality that made them sacred") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent technical competence with Marcus's maintenance worker perspective coloring perception ("heel-heavy stride," "rolling gait"). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and goal-pursuit, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("labyrinth groaned around them") that slightly exceeds the POV's natural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with occasional free indirect moments like "Mira recognized the weight of unfinished confessions." The prose achieves a meditative rhythm matching the "spiralingly calm" tone, though some phrases edge toward purple ("ribbons of sunset"). The complete absence of dialogue serves the theme of wordless teaching, creating a distinctive narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches ("forests of second thoughts," "amplified quiet") that suit the magical realist tone. Marcus's ability to hear unspoken words is handled cleanly through italics. However, dialogue between Marcus and Elena occasionally drifts into overly articulate territory for an eight-year-old under stress ("That you're teaching us to overthrow"), and some narrative passages employ elevated diction that doesn't fully align with a chess coach's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's selective perception of grace and danger reflects her defensive positioning well. Dialogue between Mira and Torven carries subtext about hidden selves. Some register elevation in passages like "sublittoral fringe" and "detach from false selves" slightly exceeds dock worker lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The performer's flat narration creates distinctive voice through purposeful drain—"her voice flat as pressed paper." Mrs. Chen's perspective filters observations with grief-tinged specificity. Dialogue serves as demonstration rather than conversation, advancing the ritual's teaching. Minor repetition in descriptive phrases prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Silas. The voice reads as generically poetic rather than character-particular, with abstract philosophical observations ("taxonomies," "permeability") that don't feel anchored in this specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira's perceptual signature shines through her attention to "texture and tone" and reading "particular gray" in gestures. The prose modulates effectively between negotiation and emotional revelation, though some phrases like "innocently cunning undertone" feel slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("golden shadows," "Victorian glass"). Some elevated diction ("artificial pilgrimage," "acoustic heritage") fits the setting but occasionally drifts toward academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with Elena's selective perception (noticing grief postures, recognizing fresh loss). The prose modulates effectively between lyric description ("curtains of intention...hung invisible") and grounded action. Dialogue between Elena and the woman carries subtext about transformation without over-articulation, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera's perceptual signature—seeing patterns in "ghost data" and reading "futures not from ancient symbols but from the patterns left behind"—remains distinct and consistent. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision and metaphorical richness, though Marcus's voice lacks comparable texture in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong conceptual voice with distinctive premise vocabulary ("atoms of nostalgia," "steadily unpredictable"), but register occasionally drifts into abstraction that doesn't match Mira's embodied experience. The prose controls rhythm well during action sequences but loses specificity in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and lyric touches ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "blooming library spread its glass petals"). The POV remains stable in close third, with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the vision sequence. Perceptual signature shows through selective attention to light and shadow. Some register elevation in peak moments ("luminous regret," "softly deliberate grace") fits the story's tone but occasionally feels reaching.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("chromatic dance," "prismatic displays") that reflects Marina's scientific background. Some filter-verb clusters in emotional peaks ("she'd felt," "she'd seen") slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature of noticing medical precision even in crisis ("micro-sutures," "subcutaneous light emitters") remains distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stability through Marta's perspective with appropriate access to her thoughts.

    Mira's perceptual signature shows in how she reads "emotional architecture" and experiences shadows as bridges rather than weapons. The keeper's dialogue carries weight ("Violence breeds in groups. Peace grows in solitude").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with some lovely moments ("each crack in the frozen marina played a different note"), but occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains against the POV ("windborne solace," "beautiful disaster").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative fantasy diction ("murmuring pavilion," "whisperfield calm") but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

The POV remains stable but doesn't modulate with the claimed urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent archival precision—"traced the photographs' timeline as vines climb, slowly but with inevitable purpose."

Perceptual signature clear in how she reads objects' whispered stories and sees patterns others miss.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent close third POV with Marina's astronomer lens coloring perception ("liquid starlight," "phosphorescence"). Clean free indirect style during memory sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara's perceptual signature—seeing weights as measurable geometries—creates a distinct voice through specialized lexicon ("fractal," "recursive," "vertices"). The lyric compression and patterned repetition ("burden," "weight," "weave") serve the accumulative structure, though occasional elevation ("prehistoric patience") slightly strains the meditative register.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature in how Margaret notices wood grain, measures time by kettle, sees "tears that wouldn't fall" in rain. Voice maintains consistency through emotional modulation. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor filter verb clustering in middle section prevents higher score.
