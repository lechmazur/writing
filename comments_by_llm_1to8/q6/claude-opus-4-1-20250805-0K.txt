  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during reflective passages ("preprocessing reality without mathematics as an intermediary," "requests for patient, humble observation") that feel more authorial than character-particular. The perceptual signature—physicist noticing gravitational lensing in dust patterns, stellar formation in mold—is specific and voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or subtext. Purposeful compression in the resignation beat is efficient, but the final paragraph's "The butterfly dust shows us how" shifts from Elena's idiom to didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled; Marina's perceptual signature (glass artist's eye for "microscopic structures," attention to frost patterns) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the ledger revelation and opening slightly during reflective beats. Diction remains within her register (technical but accessible), and the voice carries rhythmic control under pressure. Minor: a few phrases ("steadily adjusting to each revelation") edge toward summary rather than embodied perception. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV is stable throughout; Mira's perceptual signature (deaf scientist noticing heat signatures, vibrations through feet) is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her immediate sensory frame ("prismatic symphonies," "capsize survivor turned thermal composer") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular under peak pressure. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, wider during reflection). No dialogue present. The prose reflects her scientific mind but sometimes polishes emotion ("frozen tears, tiny crystals") where rawer texture might sharpen urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature: "rainbow ghosts," "breathable grief," "shadow—the peaceful darkness of earned sleep." Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chased stillness he'd pursued," "inadvertently stubborn insomnia") that feels more authorial than character-rooted, and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("The living would have to bury themselves") reads as narration stepping outside Silas's focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Marta; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during bell-ringing, wider during the six-month summary). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("benevolent shadows," "amplified quiet"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—Samuel's whispered question and Marta's reply carry subtext and advance theme without exposition. One register slip: "bureaucrats in distant capitals shuffling papers" and "woven itself together so tightly that individual threads became invisible" tilt toward elevated metaphor that slightly exceeds the established texture. Filter verbs ("understood," "discovered") appear but remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable single-third throughout. Diction carries a dreamy, elevated register appropriate to the mystical premise: "prayer written in stone," "phosphorescent trail," "copper of that ancient heartbreak." Perceptual signature reflects Mae's artist sensibility through camera-focused observation. However, elevated phrasing pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation—"foggy lucidity," "ribbons of light... like silk scarves in an underwater dance"—resulting in uniform texture that doesn't accelerate with urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Distance remains consistent but the voice doesn't tighten under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("quaking moment of revelation," "eternal, quaking reverie"). Psychic distance is controlled, filtering setting and memory through Elara's designer perspective. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("retrocognitive imprisonment," "hyperbolic geometry") that reads more authorial than character-specific, and the final paragraph's certainty ("she understood now," "she had found") smooths over ambiguity at a moment that could sustain perceptual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marcus. Diction is mostly controlled but drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure: "staggering grace," "weight of ten thousand possible futures," "forest" from "a tiny act." The piano-key decoding sequence ("each key corresponded to a number based on its position from middle C") reads more like puzzle exposition than Marcus's embodied thought process. Filter verbs ("he'd been," "he thought") are present but not intrusive. Voice is competent but not character-particular—could describe many liberators in many settings.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: Elena's synesthesia colors every sensory note, and her technical background inflects diction ("prototype," "auditory imprinting technique," "solar batteries"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the forge work. However, several passages drift into elevated, quasi-omniscient register ("Time moved differently at the cellular level") that exceeds Elena's plausible idiom under pressure. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she realized") are used sparingly and voice-appropriately. No dialogue on the page to assess. The prose rhythm supports the meditative, textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, lyric voice ("emerald-tiled walls...gleamed like scales," "amber glow"). Diction is elevated but consistent; no head-hopping occurs. The dialogue between Cassia and the mother is spare, subtext-laden, and goal-driven. Some filter verbs ("watching," "studying") appear but do not flatten immediacy. Brief convergence in the final exchange reads purposeful. Perceptual signature (light-focused, tactile) is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Marina's perceptual signature—glassblower's attention to heat, patience, transformation—is consistent and voice-specific. The self-narration device ("First, I must clear the workspace," "The torch ignites") creates purposeful ceremonial distance but becomes repetitive across multiple beats without modulation under rising pressure. Dialogue from the couple is functional and brief; Marina's spoken line carries subtext but the phrasing "Safety is not given, it is crafted" feels writerly rather than spoken in crisis. Psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Marcus's perceptual signature (the flashlight trembles "not from his usual fears, but from something deeper") anchors his specific lens. Jake's dialogue pursues clear goals (submission, control), and Marcus's responses carry subtext. Register holds mostly steady, though "trembling certainty," "grinding metal" laugh, and "firmply adaptive" edge toward thesis-speak. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains narrative distance. However, some lines veer into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "poetic," "stellar dust," "synthesis of existing ideas" phrasing in interiority undercuts the stunt double's working-class voice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with a consistent perceptual signature: the oracle notices stars, darkness, patterns, silence. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("ambered hush," "marbled the air," "veins of sound through silence"). Psychic distance remains close-third throughout. Some phrases trend toward elevated lyricism ("resin preserving a moment forever," "excruciating, beautiful patience") that edges into register drift but remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Interior access is maintained, though interiority skews abstract (thought about silence) rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Seven's processing-core metaphors, sensor readings, and temporal overlays. The prose stays within his plausible idiom ("optical sensors," "neural networks," "processing wavelength"). Purposeful compression ("seventeen timelines") is taught early and legible at closure. Minor slip: "A human would have called this moment transcendent" is helpful-narrator commentary that slightly breaks immersion. Otherwise, voice modulates cleanly with the pressure of discovery, and filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") serve the POV without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mira with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (museum lexicon, visual metaphors via lens and light). Dialogue carries subtext ("Then you know," the lens as stand-in for their history) and advances confession efficiently. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("elaborate architectures of protection," "withheld truth had crystallized") in ways that feel authorial rather than Mira's natural thought. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") cluster in mid-scene without harming immediacy. Distinct voice, minor polish needed.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable throughout, anchored in Marta's sensory signature ("gnarled fingers," "clicked softly," "wisely pragmatic"). Voice is character-particular: "This one was from the drought of '31" and "Perhaps your machine needs calibrating" carry her wry, knowing register. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven (the young woman's defeat, the inspector's bafflement, Marta's instructive tone). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the jasmine and young-woman encounters. Minor slips: "Her wisely pragmatic approach" reads slightly external, and the inspector's "Impossible" is functional but not deeply internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is moderately distinct (scientific precision, metaphor bias). However, the voice converges with the prompt's conceptual register ("holographic principles," "temporal displacement") rather than Ira's lived idiom under pressure. Phrases like "she had come to recognize" and "she could see" stack filter verbs in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Dialogue is functional but minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV distance remains stable throughout with Marcus as clean focalizer. The prose carries distinct texture through musical vocabulary and perceptual specificity ("the friction creating harmonics that shouldn't exist"). The voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to intensified closure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Psychic distance is controlled and the narrative stance fits the character's expertise. Minor slip: "miraculously dry in its waterproof shell" tells function rather than shows, and some phrases edge toward explanatory ("not a ghost but an impression, like the music notation") where image could carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature. Voice carries a distinct texture: "prayer flags in the thin alpine air," "grief made visible," "swaying certainties." Distance modulates appropriately—tighter during the aurora sequence, slightly pulled back during contextual grounding. Minor slip: occasional phrases edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds what the focalizer would plausibly formulate mid-crisis ("peripherally aware of something crucial lurking at the edges of her consciousness" reads more authorial than character-filtered). No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus filters the tunnel through explorer's idiom ("drowsy alertness—that peculiar state between exhaustion and adrenaline") and Methodist skepticism. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at discovery. Radio voices carry distinct idiom and subtext; the caller's confession reads as natural speech under stress. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: longer contemplative sentences in transit, shorter beats at the valve wheel. One minor slip: "the strange comfort of knowing that some shifts never really end" edges toward authorial summary rather than Marcus's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping appears. Diction is controlled and elevated ("phosphorescent," "catacomb," "perpetual twilight") but remains voice-consistent across beats. Perceptual signature is legible: she notices decay, pattern, and silence in character-specific ways. However, interior texture flattens under peak moments—"crumbling peace," "delicate ecology"—into abstract summary rather than embodied sensation. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations, longer lyric clauses), and no filter-verb stacks appear. The piece earns mid-6s for clean distance and voice coherence, with the caveat that stress does not degrade diction or perception as expected.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in Elena's third-person limited; perceptual signature reflects her music-therapist lens ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance"). Psychic distance is mostly controlled, though occasional omniscient drift ("Sofia grabbed her mother's hand, squeezing it with the same intensity she had during her first day of kindergarten") asserts knowledge Elena wouldn't access in the moment. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and advances the ritual. Register occasionally slips into clinical abstraction ("softly adaptive to the gathering darkness") that reads more like prompt echo than Elena's lived voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Thrain's heightened perceptual awareness. Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring clarity: "fingers trailing along spines that remembered being trees," "stories that walls had absorbed." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, contracting during the climactic perceptual opening. Diction stays within akeeper-scholar's lexicon (reclaimed, repository, stellar configurations) with purposeful elevation that matches her contemplative role. No dialogue to assess. One minor slip: "fundamental sliding of reality's centerline" in the diary's voice reads slightly more abstract-philosophical than the established register, though it's brief and attributed to a written source.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Chen with a consistent perceptual signature (musical notation, cryptographic detail). Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching Chen's analytical lens. Psychic distance is appropriate and filter verbs are minimal. One slip: "enigma of his situation" in late sections edges into abstract summary rather than lived perception. The narrative voice is distinct but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("transpose their lives into new keys") that feels more authorial than character-bound under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited on Marcus, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: architectural metaphor, sonic layering ("rooms within rooms of sacred silence"), rhetorical precision. Diction is controlled and elevated but voice-motivated for a priest-philosopher. The woman's possessed dialogue ("I am assumption... the unexamined life") shifts into abstract thesis-speak that flattens her individual texture, reading more like the story's premise voiced aloud than her interior crisis. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during loop-building, slightly wider for thematic reflection). Minor register drift when Marcus's interior turns fully expository ("Such things required patience, like teaching stone to remember it was once sand")—lovely but slightly over-written for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (temporal dislocation, musical metaphor). Diction is lyric and elevated, with purposeful compression ("upturned hush," "when that kept shifting"). However, filter verbs appear frequently ("felt," "understood," "realized") and some phrases drift toward poetic abstraction that could belong to any narrator ("space between moments"). Distance control is clean but voice specificity weakens under peak pressure when metaphor stacks without grounding in Mei's particular idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: gravity-defying physicality, fractured consciousness, architectural and procedural metaphors. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress ("she felt herself fragmenting further"). The elder-Kira dialogue feels slightly elevated ("every choice murders infinite possibilities") but remains within speculative-fiction idiom. Diction occasionally drifts toward concept-language ("infinitesimal moment," "quantum foam," "procedural generation") that reads more authorial than character-filtered, though the speculative frame allows some leeway. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited stays stable, and Lucia's perceptual signature—reading air pressure, feeling vibrations through bone—is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled and lyric ("mirrored hush," "filament of hush," "emotional permafrost"), fitting the reflective mode. The opening "fingers reading the air's subtle pressure changes" establishes sensory filtering. However, the final two paragraphs drift into summary and overt articulation ("she understood now," "she had discovered") that tell rather than trust the image. Psychic distance widens at closure when specificity would sharpen the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Elena's perceptual signature—cataloguing the bird's condition, adjusting calibrations, documenting with precision—is character-specific and maintained under pressure. The prose carries distinct texture through scientific lexicon ("barometric pressure gauge," "anemometer," "atmospheric pressure") filtered through her worldview. Voice modulates appropriately from methodical observation to charged resolve. Weakness: occasional elevated register ("progressed laterally through her routines," "intuited their purpose") reads slightly formal for the character's interior state, and the phrase "layered quiet" / "layered tranquility" recurs mechanically rather than purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice carries elevated, poetic diction ("terra-cotta," "ethically complex game," "terrible beautiful complexity") that remains uniform across emotional beats—no modulation under pressure. Marcus's perceptual signature is generic poet-speak rather than character-specific. No dialogue present. POV remains stable, but the prose reads as committee voice rather than singular perspective, and the lexicon ("savoring impossible choices like wine") feels more authorial than grounded in Marcus's roadside drifter experience.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: "able to hear melodies in the spaces between sounds" and "not an echo, but a harmonic." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("ash-dusted glass doors," "chronic hush," "acoustically perceptive"). The choice to avoid dialogue during the musicians' gathering ("for words would have shattered the delicate emergence") is purposeful and preserves tone. Minor slip: "the magnificent simplicity of survival itself" briefly elevates register in the final third, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and texture-rich: "affectionate detachment," "severed sentiments," "those merciful lies that are truer than honesty itself." Diction matches Vera's professional precision without slipping into corporate jargon. The single line of dialogue ("There you are") is brief but voice-apt. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts upward ("subsume," "electromagnetic field," "truncated form") in ways that feel more expository than character-particular under pressure. The phrase "crystalline walls into pools of liquid gold" in the opening, while vivid, risks purple flourish. Free indirect style is clean and the perceptual signature—sensing through static, tasting emotions as colors—is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Margot's perceptual signature (cargo broker's practicality meeting quiet longing) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Torres's "Personal cargo" exchange and Martha's whispered questions carry subtext. The prose modulates well from brisk opening to reflective close. Minor register drift occurs in the final paragraph ("currencies beyond her careful calculations," "eternal exchange") where diction elevates beyond the established texture, but the effect supports the thematic close without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV anchors to Kira with consistent psychic distance, and diction—"crystalline orchard trembled," "luminescent ache"—maintains a heightened lyric register throughout. However, voice modulation under pressure is minimal; Kira's interiority at the climax ("Then we'll find them together," "You were never outside the web") reads identically calm to her opening observations. Dialogue from Tomás and the artist is functional but lacks subtext or resistance, and the village youth remain undifferentiated in speech and perception. The prose serves clarity but never tightens rhythm or compresses syntax to reflect rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-close on Marina with consistent perceptual filters (illustrator's eye, temporal sensitivity). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("impossible insects," "sculptable, like clay"). No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax in the dive sequence). Psychic distance tightens during the chamber discovery. Minor: a few filter verbs ("She knew," "Marina understood") slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Morrow; no head-hopping. The prose carries a measured, slightly elevated register consistent with a "secretive conjurer" and her methodical nature. Diction choices like "dovetailed," "phosphorescent pigments," and "geometric language of glowing fungal threads" maintain voice. However, peak-beat interiority drifts into abstraction: "emotion operated on different mathematics" and "perpetually solving for connection" feel more like essay than embodied perception. Dialogue from Elias ("The formula that lets love persist despite physical absence") is articulate but lacks subtext or goal-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable in Edgar's limited third with consistent perceptual signature: he notices building systems (copper pipe temperature, beams, ventilation), sense memories tied to technology (oxide coating, vacuum tubes), and the archivist's movements through his hidden vantage. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during memory triggers, more observational during cache-giving. The archivist's single line of dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Minor deduction for "sapphire hush of dawn" in her speech, which tilts slightly purple for spoken words in this moment, though it serves the tonal requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus; narrative distance is controlled and psychic access consistent. Diction is purposeful and voice-specific ("circuitous sincerity," "reconstructing... fundamental architecture"), with perceptual signature rooted in Marcus's botanical expertise filtering all observation. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "The plants... they remember things we've forgotten" in grandmother's dialogue risks thematic echo, but it's attributed to her character and supports the premise without flattening present pressure. Rhythm modulates well under the transformation's mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Mara's perceptual signature evident: she notices rain trails as neural pathways, water as "liquified time," the woman's eyes holding "metallic hollowness." Diction stays within an artist's lexicon ("pigments," "texture," "stroke") with purposeful elevation at thematic peaks. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—"You're late" when Mara is exactly on time signals shared desperation. Minor slip: "wryly earnest tone" in the dialogue tag tells more than the line itself shows, though the woman's subsequent speech delivers the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Vera's foresight-trained attention to "silver threads" of futures shapes her noticing. The shadow-presence's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly cadence, though its explanatory function occasionally overwhelms voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, and sensory filtering (tooth-aching hum, overlapping shadows) grounds abstraction in embodied perception. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("steadily unpredictable," "bright darkness") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, particularly in the final summary paragraph where diction becomes generic and theme-serving.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV distance remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Kessa notices through an archivist's lens (palimpsests, water-marks, "topology of loss"). The brief dialogue with Matthias feels natural and advances understanding. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility ("reactively visionary," "emotionally," "accumulated patience" as explanatory phrases). Free indirect style is clean. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative voice and maintains it, though some passages read as thematic summary rather than filtered perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent distance. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "liminal hour when bad habits surrender to the possibility of change," "geometry of intention," "fortress of unspoken truths." Perceptual signature reflects her cartographer lens ("cracks in the pavement that had begun forming perfect arrows"). However, register occasionally inflates into self-conscious lyricism ("her cartographer's eyes," "the devotion of a medieval monk illuminating scripture") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate. The opening and closing images frame the arc, though the final paragraph's didactic turn ("she had become the meticulous route mapper of truths too profound for daylight") asserts voice rather than demonstrating it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with good perceptual anchoring through Elena's scientific lens. Diction fits her background (mathematical proofs, stellar movements, notation) and modulates appropriately under pressure. However, the voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("intersection where they met," "hidden sympathies," "formula for transcribing the universe's hidden sympathies"). The grandmother's quoted mysticism ("courageously kind to mysteries," "sculpting absence") reads slightly anachronistic and forced as direct speech. Psychic distance is mostly consistent but wavers when narration claims insight into Elena's final understanding without showing the micro-steps of that realization on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third on Vex; psychic distance and tense are consistent. Voice carries distinct texture ("hushed thunder," "drinking light") that modulates with the solar storm's intensity. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Thorne's two lines advance plot without subtext or character distinction. Filter verbs ("felt them gathering," "watched Thorne's crew") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts, though the narration occasionally tilts toward cosmic abstraction ("dimensional awareness," "fold in reality") that flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during embalming work, pulling back for exposition). Perceptual signature is consistent—Maya sees equations and mathematics throughout. Dialogue carries subtext (Wei's "That's not enough" / Maya's "No" exchange) and advances plot efficiently. Voice has distinct texture in the prep-room professional register blended with Maya's analytical bent. Diction remains mostly within POV lexicon. One slip: "liquefying into confusion" and "dissolving" feel slightly imposed by the prompt's "liquefies rigid thinking" requirement rather than organic to Maya's mathematical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "the valley's throat," "manuscript written in living wood," "incandescent restraint." Diction remains elevated and consistent throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. One minor register slip: "electromagnetic patterns that still echoed in the moisture between leaves" feels slightly anachronistic for the otherwise lyric medieval-monastery texture, but it does not break the established voice. The perceptual signature—filtering through the lens of temporal frequencies and "invented histories"—is clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is controlled, lyric, and consistent with Mari's contemplative, memorial focus. Perceptual signature—memory as texture, reality filtered through erasure—remains distinct throughout. Diction ("labyrinth of steel and secrets," "texture on objects") fits the introspective register. The overheard foreman dialogue reads natural and purposeful, advancing Mari's discovery without head-hopping. However, runs of similar syntactic structures ("She'd discovered… She'd learned… She kept…") and a few filter-verb stacks ("she would read," "she noticed") slightly dull immediacy in high-density passages. Psychic distance is stable, and the prose reflects Mari's state without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Marina's perceptual filter (myth-buster listening for lies, humming unconsciously) is established early. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, with occasional poetic elevation ("dying moths," "sea foam") that fits the gloomy-cheerful tone. Dialogue is functional but leans expository—Claudia's explanation delivers backstory and theme rather than pursuing goal or subtext. The line "I know what you're thinking" is meta-convenient, pre-empting skepticism rather than dramatizing it. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya throughout. Voice carries distinct texture: "hopeful desperation," "orderly intuitive mind," the graffiti decoded as survival language. Perceptual signature is present (stone chip, weathered notebook, carnival's chaos). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present (Maya's gathering speech). The phrase "before privatization reached their floating sanctuary" and "absorbthe shock of change" edge toward essay register. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the carnival's encoded warnings filter consistently through Maya's practiced lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation ("pressed her gloved finger") to reflective contemplation. Narrative stance is consistent, and diction carries a distinct texture: "Earth hung pregnant and blue," "dawnlit melancholy," "budget committees didn't care." Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: Vera notices seismic sensor gaps, chemical reactions, and ancient impact patterns. Some late-paragraph lines drift toward elevated register ("sublimating into nothingness," "when curiosity itself became too expensive") that feels slightly authorial, though the effect supports the elegiac tone. Filter verbs ("understood," "thought") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters sensory detail through Maya's heightened awareness of sound, vibration, and texture. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent. Dialogue feels functional but slightly expository—Chen's "How do you oversee such delicate work while blind?" exists to prompt Maya's explanation. The phrase "magnetic calm" appears three times across the text, twice in narration and once in dialogue, trending toward authorial assertion rather than earned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Margot's voice is distinct—dry wit as shield, atlas-editor precision, controlled observations. Her perceptual signature (noting asymmetric frost, dendritic patterns, "almost too convenient") is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext in the inspector's quiet "He believed the rivers would return" and Margot's careful hedging. POV distance is stable; free indirect style is clean. The phrase "subtly confident precision" in narration risks slight register drift, but the voice otherwise remains grounded in Margot's expertise and wary intelligence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on the bell tuner with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: "ebony tuning fork...worn smooth by centuries," "wild hush," "cities aren't made of stone...made of harmony." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Learning to rebuild...with memory and rhythm"). The perceptual signature (listening to footsteps, feeling rhythm) remains character-specific. Minor register drift: "infinitely patient" and "shared balance" read slightly elevated for the focalizer's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Maya; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—scientific observation layered with mystical receptivity—and diction balances technical terms (nitrogen narcosis, bioluminescent) with lyric phrasing ("lonesome splendor," "unsnarl from time"). Voice modulates appropriately as urgency rises, compressing syntax in the final paragraphs. Minor artifice: "unsnarl" recurs three times as a verb for both spatial paradoxes and consciousness, reading slightly forced; "gathered hush" appears four times, pushing from motif into over-reliance. Filter verbs ("felt it in the way," "understood") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated and do not flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("copper light," "hover-carved"), though some phrases edge toward overwrought ("threading his way into the corridor like smoke through a keyhole"). Marcus's perceptual signature is present but generic—no character-specific filter beyond the hovering trait. The lattice glowing and accepting threads reads as slightly florid metaphor rather than grounded perception. No dialogue present to evaluate. Voice is competent but lacks a sharp, embodied texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Marlow notices resin, mercury, carved stone warmth). Dialogue carries subtext ("You're early this year" implies ritual familiarity). However, elevated diction risks register drift: "ephemeral cameos," "lovingly venomous affection," "resonant awakenings" read more authorial than character-particular under stress. The ghost bride's voice is distinct from Marlow's in dialogue, but interior narration occasionally smooths into generic lyricism ("toxicity that both preserved and slowly consumed") rather than Marlow's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and cleanly filtered through Calla's perceptual signature: "phantom stitches," "pigments that refused to fade," "air grew thick with possibility." Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with purposeful elevation that fits the mythic frame. Minor register drift in the final paragraph ("a story that began with ending, a precedent built from broken rules") edges toward thematic caption rather than lived perception, but remains legible and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV focalization is clean and stable throughout; narrative distance matches Miriam's knowledge state (historian's recognition of the bronze, grandmother's role). Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—"catacomb orchard," "keeper of hours," "diaspora's circular path"—without register drift. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads landscape through ancestral memory and historical layers. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; Yakov's lines ("You came back," "She knew you'd come back") carry subtext of inevitability. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the ending when Miriam's interior reflection ("something Miriam hadn't known she'd lost") modulates to the closing image. Minor deduction: the phrase "cautious enchantment" appears both as descriptor and internal state, creating slight label-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature (professional attention to chalk symbols, inherited tools, analog rituals) is distinct and consistent. Diction is confident and purposeful ("juxtapose the authentic self against the performed one"), with rhythmic variation across paragraphs. Brief elisions (client's full backstory, chalk decoding mechanics) serve compression without harming clarity, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Vera's perceptual signature: she notices officers' "echoed silence," tracks guard rotations, sees flame-cast shadows revealing "adjacent possibilities." Her professional lens (mathematical precision, memory techniques encoded as melody) filters all observation. Dialogue carries subtext effectively—"The stars whisper such lovely secrets" masks tactical intelligence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening to close observation during Crane's inspection, pulling back for summary of months' work. Clean focalization with no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent—elevated but grounded in her scholarly-artisan register.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: the medium filters setting through her gift (spirits' songs, visions, the shard's pulse). Diction is elevated and lyric ("mercury between the mangroves," "pearl of truth") and remains within the established voice; no register drift into mundane corporate speak. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the window-touching moment, slightly wider during the spirits' explanation. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she heard herself say, though her lips hadn't moved") in one high-pressure beat, but it serves the mystical mode rather than obscuring immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's perceptual signature is consistent—she notices script, pattern, neural pathways in coral convolutions—and the morphine justifies her "loose and honest" tongue. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the child's "My mama used to dance" lands with subtext. Free indirect style is clean throughout. One minor slip: "lotus-hearted ache…not quite grief, not quite guilt" drifts toward poetic abstraction that slightly exceeds Maya's established diction under morphine, though it remains within plausible range for a practiced translator.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is clear: Marina notices pigments, plaster texture, photon metaphors, all filtered through artist's idiom. Diction stays consistent ("gossamer strokes," "luminescence flowed," "fold of daydream") with purposeful lyricism. No head-hopping. The knowledge-network moment risks slight omniscience ("hundreds of muralists ... their techniques flooded") but reads as gift-enabled perception rather than POV leak. Psychic distance modulates well from concrete touch to expansive vision. One line edges toward prompt echo: "Show me what joy looked like here" reads slightly authorial, but recovers quickly in embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elena's perceptual signature (methodical restorer noticing layers) is established early. However, the disembodied voice ("she heard herself say, though her lips hadn't moved") introduces unexplained dual consciousness that blurs focalization without teaching the pattern or paying it off as unreliable narration. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Marcus's single line lacks subtext. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to be watching") cluster in the opening without voice motivation. The prose modulates toward lyricism under pressure ("bewitched the space itself") but the elevated diction ("methodically painting over what she'd just uncovered") does not always match a restorer's working register.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Marcus's professional lens (documenting chrysalis, recognizing beetle-track script). Psychic distance is controlled; the narrative never claims knowledge beyond Marcus's sight or speculation. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit—Serena's "fashionably so" and "candidly cryptic" speech patterns establish character, though her voice could be more distinct from the narrator's elevated register in peak beats. Filter verbs ("watched," "spotted") appear but are voice-motivated. The prose maintains distinct perceptual signature (entomologist's trained observation) throughout pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is poetic and consistent: "reef-shadow joy," "fossilized forgiveness," "nutritiously complex." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ensconced," "permeates") that feels authorial rather than emerging from the poet's specific idiom under pressure. No dialogue, so subtext and voice-distinction tests are not applicable. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off at closure, but the voice lacks the grit or embodied texture that would charge peak moments more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Mira's perception throughout. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Diction ("gently systematic precision," "foxglove regret") is elevated and lyric, fitting the library's ethereal register, though phrases like "methodical rituals" and "practiced grace" edge toward stock descriptors. The prose carries a distinct, formal texture that matches the setting. Perceptual signature is clear (Mira notices chimes, orchids, preserved sounds). No dialogue to assess. Free indirect access is clean. The final paragraph's "sacred work" risks slight sermonizing but stays within character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Elena's perceptual signature shows through her focus on symbols, patterns, and the archive's sensory details filtered through scholarly urgency. Diction is largely controlled and voice-consistent, though occasional elevated phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "the symphonies of truth") trends slightly abstract for peak moments. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The phrase "carefully reckless" and "truth could still symphony" show purposeful compression that supports voice, though "symphony" as a verb in the final paragraph ("truth could still symphony") reads as a reach for effect rather than natural idiom within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dappled resolve," "star-drunk night"), though occasionally elevated in ways that slightly exceed a machinist's plausible lexicon under stress. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices thermal expansion, adhesive resins, and flow patterns. The "slyly heartfelt" voice is established and held. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext cannot be judged. Minor: a few phrases ("encrypted compassions," "the building breathing through centuries") read as thematic declaration rather than embedded perception, creating slight distance drift at those beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Margot's perceptual signature—mapping trajectories, converting songs to flight patterns—remains consistent and voice-specific. Free indirect style is clean with controlled psychic distance. Register occasionally drifts upward ("blooming with suspicion," "vast archive of her healing heart") in moments that would benefit from tighter embodiment. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Dialogue is minimal (Theodore's two lines) but purposeful and advances the reveal. Rhythmic control supports the meditative accumulation, though the closing paragraph edges toward summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and strong perceptual signature: Marina notices grain, measures distances, interprets weather codes. Diction is consistent and elevated ("featherly determined," "fractured hush") but some phrases—"intuited," "sacred geometry," "drifting soul"—drift toward stock lyricism. No dialogue; interiority is clear. Filter verbs ("felt it," "knew better") are voice-motivated. One minor slip: "the corn maze exhaled" personifies setting in a way that softens POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature: she traces constellations in condensation, watches for what machines can't measure, and filters the city through astrological metaphor. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("shadowseam wonder," "dialogue between sky and abyss"). Chen's brief dialogue serves his goal (requesting evidence) and stays distinct in register. No head-hopping or unmotivated psychic leaps. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: the sea-foam recollectionist's perceptual signature (emotions that taste, hum, smell) and the "cheerfully gloomy" diction establish a consistent narrative stance. Psychic distance is stable; reflection is anchored in present stimuli (holding the glass, kneeling by sprouts). However, some phrasing leans toward abstract philosophizing ("archaeology of abandoned futures," "genetic material of a path") that drifts into elevated register without full grounding in the character's immediate sensory experience. The final singing line and "bright melancholy" nicely reinforce voice under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with Marcus's perceptual signature (sight lines, acoustic sweet spots, "calculated wilderness") consistent throughout. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "engineered spontaneity," "liminal space between land and sea." The single line of direct dialogue—"Life's a chess match..."—feels slightly expository, a thesis moment rather than goal-driven speech, but it's brief. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the teenager interaction, wider during the setup and packing. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the closing rhythm ("Behind him, waves erased...") charges the exit. Minor slip: the "calculated wilderness" phrase recurs as both image and meta-label, risking self-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance consistent. Perceptual signature: Mira notices gaps, tides, intervals. However, diction drifts into elevated register—"spontaneously anchored," "meridians that mirrored planetary orbits"—that reads more authorial than character-bound. Psychic distance remains steady, but the narrator's texture is not strongly differentiated from generic literary fantasy voice. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Marcus's perceptual signature: he notices stress fractures, beading condensation, interference patterns. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a lyric cadence that matches his contemplative stance. Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the stone-throwing beats. Small deduction: some metaphorical constructions in the final third drift into elevated register ("noctilucent reckoning," "birthplaces of possibility") that feel slightly authorial rather than organically Marcus's lexicon under pressure, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with tight psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—fire metaphors, embodied physicality, sensory grounding. The recorded message uses clean dialogue that advances theme without feeling expository. Two slips: "grief transmuted into something harder and softer than sorrow" toggles into elevated register briefly, and "mocked human urgency" in the celestial passage anthropomorphizes in a way that slightly breaks the grounded voice. No head-hopping, and the filter verbs ("watching," "thought of") feel voice-motivated rather than distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice carries a distinct speculative-lyric texture ("serene upheaval," "amplitude: the measurement of possibility waves") but frequently slips into expository summary ("Marina had discovered," "She'd become a detective"). Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. POV remains stable, but psychic distance flattens under pressure rather than modulating purposefully. Dialogue is absent; no test of voice distinction applies.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Mira's perceptual signature (trained senses, wall vibrations). Psychic distance modulates appropriately when she closes her eyes to expand her senses. Diction stays within her lexicon, though "molecular structure" and "resonance detectors" risk minor register elevation. Voice is consistent but not sharply distinct—syntax and rhythm remain steady across emotional beats rather than degrading or compressing under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maya's painter's perception (cerulean, dusky harmony, violet shadows/golden promises). Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrator's way of noticing—light, color, acoustics—feels character-specific. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("perceptively calm," "credible endurance") that reads more authorial than Maya's lived experience. The prism-parapet metaphor and the borrowed-heartbeat refrain recur purposefully. No dialogue on the page; the lullaby fragments function as sung interiority. Sentence rhythm varies but leans toward uniform lyric cadence in places ("not quite night, not quite day, but something between"), which supports tone but risks monotony under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature: her touch on the clipboard, recognition of delegates' exhaustion, ironic laughter as "broken music." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with the Theren's "bones chiming" providing character-specific idiom and Mara's speech pursuing the goal of breaking deadlock through indirection and image. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("her fingers still moving") to wider observation of the delegates. Minor filter-verb reliance ("watching," "recognizing") in a few lines and slightly elevated diction ("operatively gentle," "certified hatred") in peak beats nudge the score down from the 8+ band, but voice remains coherent and the ending's perceptual control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Vera notices drone feeds, algorithms, tax write-offs—details filtered through her technocratic lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("manufactured catastrophe," "acoustic fossil beds"). No head-hopping. Minor register issue: "archive of absences" and "sole, terrible translator" briefly elevate into abstract literary diction that feels slightly external to the established voice, though not enough to break immersion. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure (tablet update vs. final glance).

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric register ("body a living poem," "cada movement a verse") that fits the elevated Academy setting. However, the diction is uniformly ornate across all beats, including high-pressure moments, without modulation; descriptions like "alarming thing about serenity" read as narratorial intrusion rather than Lyralei's perception. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular—syntax and imagery feel authorial rather than filtered through a courtesan's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and the perceptual signature—Marcus noticing acoustic properties, shadow play, ink-wash techniques—feels character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("urbane demeanor," "diplomatic calligraphy commissions") that reads more like external assessment than his lived interiority. The prose carries a consistent meditative rhythm, but under the story's reflective weight, we lose the compression and propulsion that would modulate with pressure; the cadence stays uniformly contemplative throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's attentive, reverential perception. Diction is elevated and controlled ("interrupted cadence," "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted") with a consistent lyric texture. No dialogue appears. A few moments drift toward over-wrought lyricism ("water droplets seemed to pause mid-fall, creating prisms that hung like unfinished sentences") that risks preciousness, and the phrase "esoteric realist" in the opening feels label-like rather than demonstrated. Overall, voice is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (lost wax caster's lens on transformation), though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("technically gentle," "investment material"). The phrase "technically gentle movements" reads more like craft jargon than embodied action. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-appropriate. Psychic distance is consistent. However, some sentences feel more like exposition than character-specific perception, especially in the Victorian/Arctic peoples backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Kira notices outcomes but not origins—though her internal voice occasionally slips into elevated philosophical register ("some paths choose their walkers" repeated verbatim from childhood feels more like a motif than natural thought under pressure). Psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct texture with balanced rhythm and purposeful vocabulary. Filter verbs are minimal. However, peak moments drift into abstract language ("transcending not through escape but through acceptance, carrying the gritty truth that all foresight is hindsight wearing tomorrow's mask") that reads as authored insight rather than character-particular perception in crisis. Voice remains coherent but the diction at closure exceeds what the moment's pressure would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature tilts toward architectural and mathematical observation ("calculated gaps," "celestial ratios"). Diction is controlled but occasionally slips into elevated register not clearly motivated by Mara's voice ("orthogonal to dimensions," "uncloak itself," "dusky harmony"). No dialogue present. The final paragraph's summary mode—"She smiled, knowing her frugal years had purchased"—shifts to retrospective certainty that flattens urgency. Psychic distance widens at closure when immediacy is most needed. Internal voice is coherent but not deeply character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    Omniscient distance is consistent and the voice carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("violence lived not in fists but in the grip we keep"). However, Marcus's certainty ("His son's fever would break within the hour, Marcus knew") violates POV modesty—he cannot know future outcomes. Diction remains elevated and coherent throughout, though some phrasing trends generic-profound ("every object remembered its purpose, just as every person carried the echo of who they might become").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's POV remains stable with craft-specific diction ("reading the curve of glass," "silvering with chemicals derived from the fog") and selective attention that favors texture and light. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs. The astronomer's dialogue ("I glimpsed something...that erased all boundaries") carries appropriate desperation without filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean. Elara's perceptual signature—touch over sight, patient pragmatism—distinguishes her voice. The prose modulates from grounded craft detail to lyric intensity during the vision without losing coherence. Minor filter verbs ("recognized," "understood") appear but remain voice-motivated. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; both characters pursue their needs through implication and direct request.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; Elara's perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, crystal knowledge) is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Mira's directness contrasting Elara's measured reflection. The "deciduous vows" opener and "accidental wisdom" line carry slight authorial flourish but remain voice-plausible. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally at key beats. The prose rhythm varies with pressure, and quote mechanics are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "bewildered still but purposeful," sensory details filtered through curator expertise (acquisition ledger, ultraviolet light). Diction is generally controlled and voice-consistent. However, elevated register occasionally exceeds character lexicon during peak pressure: "temporal vertigo," "liminal space," "quantum branches" read more authorial than curator-particular. The other-self's dialogue ("Time inherits itself here, backwards and forwards, like light bouncing between mirrors") is slightly too on-theme, explaining rather than implying. Psychic distance stays consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is present—Mira notices linguistic patterns, gaps, and encoded directions—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("consuming Mount Erebis from within, its corridors spiraling through hollowed rock like the chambers of an ancient heart") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The mountain's voice ("What will you offer that they could not?") reads cleanly. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Marina; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during memory shifts, slightly wider when describing the ship). Perceptual signature is distinct: emerald swatch pressed against paint, DNA patches, "cellular memories." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-rooted, but remains within a scientist-protagonist's plausible lexicon. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and carries subtext ("You're early" / "I'm Coraline, though Marina knew that wasn't true"). No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with distance modulating purposefully (close during rope work, pulling back for world-building). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices patterns, braids, contradictions—archival details filtered through her expertise. Diction stays controlled, favoring precise, slightly elevated register ("liminal space," "fables of absence") that fits the scholarly milieu without becoming academic jargon. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance tightens during the rope configurations and the final door crossing, sharpening immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The mapkeeper's perceptual signature is distinct (reading the world through patterns, finding "where silence pooled, where sound gathered"). Diction remains within her professional register ("ripple-marks," "internal architecture," "predetermined fractures"). Voice modulates appropriately—contemplative during examination, focused during the ritual. No head-hopping. The prose reflects her patient, observational stance through rhythm and syntax. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she noticed") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. One minor slip: "gentle luminescence of understanding warm her chest like a second, quieter heart" edges toward poetic abstraction that doesn't fully match her established practical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and consistently lyric-technical, blending custodian pragmatism with metaphysical perception ("retrocognitive blessing pulling her into memories," "anti-light, a darkness so profound it illuminated everything"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that tests the custodian's lexicon ("Aurelius had been dark for a generation," "inevitable convergences"), and some figurative constructions feel more authorial than character-filtered. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply individuated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Lyra's perspective. Diction is elevated and consistent ("alabaster seas," "ancient fire," "deepening hush") but trends toward a lyric register that flattens urgency even in potential crisis moments. Perceptual signature is present (Lyra notices shadow lengths, crystal hums, lightning theater) but the voice lacks distinct idiom—sentences could belong to any reflective archivist. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("She understood now," "she realized") appear frequently at peak beats, dulling immediacy when embodied action could sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaia's perceptual signature—filtering chaos through designer's rhythm and chemical formulae—is consistent and voice-specific. The chant device is distinctive and modulates with purpose. Dialogue is minimal but natural; the mosaic artist's "Fireworks without stars?" carries subtext. The phrase "serious playfulness" appears only in narration, never embodied in Kaia's choices. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV through Mira remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "truth rarely announced itself directly...emerged sideways, like the spider crab." Dialogue feels natural with subtext (Chen's "You think I abandoned the work" carries accusation and defense). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in Mira's observations, slightly pulled back in the final paragraph's summary of Chen's return). Minor slips: "the patient drip of seawater returning home" and "texture of these transitions" edge toward elevated diction slightly outside a field scientist's working idiom, though they remain voice-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered consistently through Mira's sensory hierarchy: she notices textures of silence, the doll's warmth, molecular bonds preparing to shift. The prose rhythm modulates effectively under pressure—short clauses during the inversion ("The clouds rushed upward—or she fell upward—she couldn't tell"), longer lyric passages during the harvest. Diction stays character-particular: "honey-copper sweetness," "frost made of whispers," "cathedral of quiet." No dialogue appears, appropriately for a story centered on silence. The perceptual signature is distinct and purposeful; Mira's way of noticing (cataloguing flavors, comparing bunker silence to trellis hush) drives the piece's conceptual architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as clear focalizer; perceptual signature is strong (he reads air pressure, navigates acoustic zones "like a musician reading sheet music"). The prose texture is consistent and purposeful, with diction that fits his twelve-year expertise. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven; Marcus's "voice calibrated to barely disturb the air" and his completion of her sentence feel natural. The woman's interiority is accessed only through external observation, maintaining focalization discipline. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates appropriately as emotional intensity rises through the terraces.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scanner detecting chromium oxide, suit's visor filtering the waterfall) but not character-particular—the diction reads elevated and genre-neutral rather than reflecting Anya's specific idiom or professional priorities as a lore keeper. Phrases like "wisely adventurous steps" and "democracy reborn in exile" drift into essayistic register. The single line of dialogue ("Sally forth," "They chose not to rule") carries thematic weight but does not pursue a goal or reveal subtext. Psychic distance is consistent; no filter-verb stacks. Narrative stance modulates appropriately (wonder at the orchard, solemnity at the mural), but the prose does not sharpen under pressure—syntax remains uniform through discovery beats. The final paragraph's rhythm ("carrying the future's memory of a past that chose not to repeat itself") prioritizes lyricism over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: diction ("cauterized," "loaded emptiness," "careful devastation") anchors the keeper's particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("You're not ready," "Breathing requires emptiness first") feels voice-consistent and purposeful. Syntax modulates under pressure without losing coherence. The piece sustains a singular perspective throughout, meeting the 9+ perceptual-signature test with strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Marina throughout. Perceptual signature is present (the bolt-touching ritual, her bitter-bright laugh). However, register drifts into corporate-therapeutic diction during peak beats: "quantum multiplication protocols," "transmute failure into wisdom," "filter." Dr. Chen's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than characterized. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the phone's voice ("Trust the pressure") lacks sufficient grounding as internalized perception versus external text. The "virtuously mischievous" descriptor in narration doesn't match Marina's actual voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, with a distinct narrative voice: "the first yawn of evening," "hunger for knowledge had become a generational poison." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the gramophone sequence. One slip: "standing waves of perception rippled through the amber-tinted air" briefly elevates diction beyond the established texture, and "bridge of intuition" feels slightly imposed rather than organically embedded in Victoria's perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is elevated and poetic ("factually mystical," "bypassed the ear and etched itself directly onto consciousness") but consistent within the fantasy register. However, at peak pressure—the oath, the transformation—the prose leans into abstract metaphor ("molten possibility," "quantum simultaneously") that names states rather than grounding them in Aldric's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy when the stakes should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature throughout: Marcus reads dust "like braille," interprets files "not for what they said, but for what they desperately tried to say," and his professional vocabulary (intake form, placement record, digitization priorities) anchors his focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the button discovery and widening slightly for the final thematic reflection. The prose carries distinct texture—"dust motes unfurl...like tiny spirits released from bondage," "the broken-hearted learned to speak in artifacts and silence"—that reflects Marcus's professional precision and emotional need. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice. The final paragraph's elevated register ("repository of society's most vulnerable histories") fits the archival lens but brushes against over-articulation, a minor friction that prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout, with no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature (reading light in puddles, tracing embossed letters) is specific and consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imported rather than character-rooted: "auric lagoon," "verdigris," "algorithms listening." Dialogue is functional but thin on subtext; Jakob's lines serve primarily to prompt Mira's explanations. The voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax remains even-keeled whether Mira is crouching by the lagoon or uploading files at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; distance is controlled and Marcus's perceptual signature (musical, atmospheric, quiet) is consistent. Diction ("vested hush," "shadow-song," "unheard harmonies") leans lyric-literary and occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calibrated quiet," "cultivated restraint") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm modulates purposefully between description and action, though some passages ("practice the art of musical negative space") read more expository than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains lyric register throughout with distinct perceptual signature ("seeds hummed frequencies," "roots drank from clouds"). Psychic distance stays stable in close third. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with immediate perception under pressure: "euphoria of finally comprehending one's purpose" and "decoder of gravity's rebellious children" read as authorial summation rather than character-filtered thought. The prose commits to its pattern-taught style, but some passages (final paragraph especially) drift into thematic annotation. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Marcus notices patterns, weights, vibrations). The phrase "uncertainly certain" repeats as a stylistic tic across multiple beats, and free indirect style occasionally slips into expository summary ("He understood then what he'd been trying to do all along"). No dialogue appears. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though rhythmic variation under pressure is minimal; the prose maintains a steady, contemplative cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV through Vera is stable and confident, with distinct perceptual signature: alchemical lens colors her observations (vials "balanced between poison and cure," water patterns as biological systems). Dialogue feels natural and advances the scene without exposition dumps. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the coin demonstration. Mira's speech carries less distinct idiom but remains credible for a distressed teenager. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats without filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-melancholy register ("bronze the eastern wall," "achingly luminous") that modulates with emotional beats—compression at Thomas's materialization, expansion during the harp's final notes. Perceptual signature: Mara notices warmth in the tooth, sound distortion, light quality, all filtered through practiced soul-collector attention. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Tell me about your last performance" pursues confession; "Play it wrong" urges the breakthrough), with Thomas's hesitant "I never learned" and "I was so afraid" carrying subtext of shame. Minor filter-verb presence ("feeling its warmth pulse," "watched her") but not dense enough to dull immediacy. Thomas's voice and Mara's internal narration remain distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is tightly controlled; all perceptions filter through Lyra's enhanced sensorium (UV wavelengths, infrared heat signatures, vertebral positions). Diction matches her analytic interior voice ("inverse equation," "reciprocals," "Fibonacci spirals") without slipping into Wikipedia-voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during strap removal, slightly elevated during forest walk, intimate again at the child encounter. One brief dialogue exchange ("Every light has a frequency…") feels natural and goal-driven, teaching without exposition. No head-hopping. The phrase "gifts from the enhancement procedures that had once made her the Coalition's perfect intelligence officer" in paragraph one carries minor filter weight but is voice-motivated by her clinical self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Mira's perceptual signature: she notices pentimento, color-coded spells, and hand-signs, filtering the market through her translator's lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, slightly distant for backstory anchoring). Valdric's dialogue ("You see it," "Unfasten what time has bound") carries purpose and subtext, advancing plot without exposition. One deduction: diction in reflective beats trends elevated ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition," "eternal instant") in ways that occasionally drift from embodied interiority toward thematic labeling, reducing voice specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature is distinct (Marcus notices cable-song, dust patterns, sequin-light, "light that no longer existed"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("singing cables," "dying wasp trapped in glass," "yellow as old teeth"). Distance modulates cleanly from tight sensory immersion to brief reflective pulls without head-hopping. One Teresa dialogue moment ("You weren't selling tickets… You were buying silence") advances understanding through implication. Minor deduction: the phrase "analyzing dust accumulation patterns" in the early section reads slightly clinical and filter-heavy for the established voice, and "engaged with the space carefully" is a filter construction that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Moth with a consistent lyric register. Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("negotiable reality," "origami made of time") fits the metaphysical premise. Perceptual signature is present in how Moth notices frost patterns and whisper frequencies. No head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into narrator glossing ("She understood now why she had been cryptic") that tells rather than trusts image. Psychic distance is intentionally wide but consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Cassia's poet-revolutionary lens, with diction like "cadence of the poems she'd written in prison" establishing voice. However, register drifts occur: "temporal Revelation," "crystalline matrices," and "reimagine, reconstructed from their own memories" read more like concept-speak than Cassia's idiom under pressure. Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext; Huang's lines serve exposition ("the protocols are clear") without pursuing a competing goal. The final paragraph's syntax—"beautiful and terrible and absolutely real," "unimaginable victories"—smooths into aesthetic summary rather than maintaining the concrete texture of earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent and the perceptual filter (repairman's eye for mechanisms, resonance) feels character-specific. Vex's dialogue ("The Council demands your progress") and Elias's careful reply carry subtext and goal-pursuit. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("sympathetic vibrations," "tether... threads of pure silver... sung into existence") in ways that feel more authorial than a tinkerer's internal voice under pressure, and the narrative certainty about the Covenant's history ("when the first midnight council stole...") exceeds what Elias would plausibly narrate mid-repair without filter.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register appropriate to Vera's sensibility: "stone throat," "submarine light," "rain-memory." Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style is clean. The phrase "sensibly eccentric" recurs purposefully to frame her withdrawal. Minor register drift into abstraction ("impossible truths," "cosmic rain") in the vision sequence, but the voice recovers and grounds itself in tactile detail (vial, compass, moonlight) at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited holds steady throughout, with Marina's perceptual signature (wood as memory, reverence for grain) coloring description. Diction is elevated and consistent—"turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances"—though occasionally it drifts toward prompt-language: "scaffold complexity with simplicity" and "reimagined by the storm" echo thematic keywords rather than Marina's organic idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the carving sequence, tightening to sensory immediacy. No dialogue appears; the voice is singular and reflective. Minor filter-verb stacking ("she saw," "she felt," "she understood") in the slide sequence slightly dulls immediacy, but overall the prose maintains a lyric, contemplative texture that fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-close on Mara; perceptual signature is consistent (she notices paint, light, layering). Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful compression ("held breath," "urgently driven") that teaches a pattern. One persistent friction: "dawning hush" and several lyric phrases ("petals that caught moonlight like memories," "soft as petals, patient as the moon's slow journey") repeat cadence and vehicle across multiple paragraphs, creating convergence at emotional peaks and reducing distinctness. The prose reads as singular voice but leans toward patterned lyricism that can flatten urgency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable; Amara's archival lens shapes perception (e.g., "symbols only another archivist would recognize"). Marcus's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext ("reading it wrong could destroy everything we built"). However, diction occasionally inflates under pressure: "retrocognitively locked," "searing reverie," "inseparable in their struggle" read as elevated register rather than Amara's lived thought. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans abstract when embodiment would deepen urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable; no head-hopping. Diction reflects an alchemist's perceptual signature: "molecule by molecule," "working memory," "essence." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the transformation, pulling back for the final image. Sentence rhythm varies with pressure: short declaratives at the choice point ("He pressed the bottle against his forehead"), longer accretive syntax during the memory flood. One register slip: "the alchemy of memory married to imagination" in the final paragraph reads slightly elevated and meta-commentary adjacent, though it remains voice-plausible for a Guild-trained thinker. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture: "oath scribe," "cadence of a Phoenician merchant's haggling," "velvet disquiet" in diction choices. Perceptual signature is character-specific—Matthias notices language patterns, grooves, emotional tremors. The third-grade memory is cleanly anchored in present perception ("triggered something deep"). No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "emotional patterns within them" and "spectrums of emotion became inexpressible" veer slightly academic for the immediate POV filter, though they remain plausible for a scholar's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly throughout with no head-hopping; Mira's perceptual signature (three-hundred-winter experience, seed-saver lens filtering "velvet worn smooth" time and "humming" seeds) is distinct and consistent. Diction remains elevated but stable within her focalizer lexicon, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the temporal-drift sensation. The voice carries a consistent texture—patient, precise, slightly archaic—that supports the wild-serenity tone without register drift or filter-verb stacking in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's sensory priority (listening, humidity, pressure) filters description consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("She closed her eyes and listened with her whole body") to wider observation of the valleys. Minor slips: "credibly curious" is an external judgment rather than interior texture, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("primal authority," "walls of snow reshape the landscape") drifts slightly from Mara's established idiom under stress, though it remains legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable and apt, filtering the universe through Kepler-9's spiritually curious lens with distinct perceptual signature (seeing pilgrims where others see debris, reading subtler languages). Diction remains controlled with purposeful elevation ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") that fits the contemplative voice. However, several phrases veer into abstract philosophizing that risks losing the focalizer's concrete ground: "relationship, not just physics but philosophy" and "strength wasn't about enduring motion, but about finding the courage to be perfectly, vulnerably present" read as authorial thesis rather than janitor's embodied thought. Free indirect style is clean but occasionally slips into summarizing the theme rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited through Mara's lens. Perceptual signature is consistent—"careful steps of someone who had learned that survival meant noticing everything while disturbing nothing." The prose carries a distinct lyric register appropriate to post-apocalyptic solitude. However, several phrases drift toward elevated diction that strains the voice: "tranquil perception," "mute eloquence," "museum of unfinished conversations." These feel more authorial than character-filtered, creating minor distance wobbles in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture ("rust-colored horizon," "sandpaper of anxiety, silk of contentment, sticky tar of grief") that reflects Marcus's timekeeping lens. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "could perceive") appear frequently but stay within the contemplative voice. The middle section shifts into expository summary about Voss's design, flattening narrative distance and momentum. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks a perceptual signature sharp enough to distinguish Marcus's noticing from generic narration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Mira with clean distance control and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees "symphonies in seaweed tangles," notices barbule detail, frames events through her poetic lens. Diction is elevated but character-appropriate ("liminal space," "burnished hush"), though phrases like "that particular light" and "study in loss" occasionally drift toward literary summary rather than concrete perception. Dialogue is brief, natural, and advances the moment. Psychic distance modulates purposefully; free indirect style is clean. A few filter verbs ("she thought," "she understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No register mismatch or voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with clear focalization through Mira's scientific-yet-reverent perceptual signature: she notices electromagnetic pulses, mineral phosphorescence, and mathematical patterns. Diction remains voice-consistent ("gently systematic precision," "brazen calm") with selective technical vocabulary (electromagnetic signature, crystalline structures) anchored in her caretaker role. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure—shorter beats when the network completes, reflective rhythms during realization. One minor register drift: "monument to the possibility of interspecies respect" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, but the slip is brief and does not obscure the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena with appropriate psychic distance. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous skepticism," "bronze quiet," "ancient moisture") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("pre-rational," "species capable of understanding") that blurs immediacy. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Marcus's lines advance plot without strong subtext. The perceptual signature—Elena filtering setting through academic lens—is present but could be more character-particular. No head-hopping or tense breaks, and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains controlled. Voice carries distinct elevated diction ("narrow vastness," "viciously fertile," "green chaos") that fits a ritual speaker with archaic knowledge. However, register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction—"the submerged concord between species" and "promise of green chaos" read as authorial framing rather than the coachman's lived idiom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (gull-call translation, Akkadian labels) but the coachman's interiority reads more as mythic narrator than embodied individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Sage's failing eyes and nose create character-specific sensory hierarchy. Kemp's "wild hush" voice and diction ("Heard you needed this") distinguish him briefly. The phrase "color-tinted revelations" and "chromatic compass" carry a consistent metaphoric logic tied to the grooves' text-as-vibration. One slip: "translate distance into closeness" and "sorrow transformed into hope" edge toward thematic summary rather than enacted perception at peak moments. Diction remains within Sage's plausible lexicon (bloodhound tracker, post-war survivor) with minor elevation ("scripture," "mythology") that supports rather than disrupts voice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, third-person close; psychic distance and tense are stable. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kira notices temporal flow, the compass's warmth, her grandmother's voice in recycled air—and the prose modulates under emotional pressure ("The blessed pariah smiled, understanding at last"). Diction is controlled and apt for a station navigator with a lyrical bent. No dialogue on the page; all pressure is interiorized and externalized through action. Filter verbs ("she heard them," "she glimpsed") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Renn. Voice texture is consistent: figurative density (sky writhing, ice singing harmonies) matches the fantastical register throughout. Diction remains elevated but character-appropriate for a trained apprentice. The Keeper's speech ("Your master failed his test") is functional but generic; no distinct idiom emerges. Filter verbs ("feeling the ancient ice hum") are sparse and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with Marina's perceptual signature (architectural accident of acoustics, microseconds of meaning). Diction is elevated but consistent; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. The one dialogue exchange with the other survivor feels slightly expository ("They're forming the new government tomorrow. They want witnesses") but serves plot economically. Under peak pressure (the refusal moment) the voice stays controlled. Some register elevation ("benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra") rides the line of lexicon fit but reads as Marina's interior scholarly vocabulary. Psychic distance is intentional and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; the seer's perceptual signature is distinct (texture-based navigation, silver dreams, memories as sensations rather than images). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("mercury-glass seer," "the texture of a feather"), with purposeful lyric compression. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear but serve the contemplative voice. Distance modulates appropriately as emotional intensity rises. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts; the prose reflects the focalizer's mind and state throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering the frozen village through Kaspar's chess-tutor lens (recognizing the Sicilian Dragon error, seeing the queen as sacrificed to save a pawn). Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "fierce repose" and "winnowed truth from possibility" maintaining a lyric register. However, the voice occasionally drifts toward abstract poeticism ("silence itself became tangible, creating spaces between frozen seconds") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears, appropriately. Perceptual signature is clear: Kaspar notices tactical errors, patterns, and the weight of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Kira's perceptual signature (seeing echoes as refractions, interpreting carved handholds as legacy) remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("Words are prisms," "The truth is not a blade but water"). One focalization slip: "Other prisoners...heard not one meaning but dozens" asserts their interior experience with certainty beyond Kira's knowledge, a brief omniscient leak. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent throughout; no head-hopping beyond that single line, and the narrative distance suits the mythic-register concept.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Mira's perspective. Voice carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("threads of golden light," "burning moment when lungs scream") that suits the dying-world tone. The statue's dialogue ("You understand...") is purposeful but risks brief head-hopping—its voice emerges as collective memory rather than independent consciousness, which keeps it POV-adjacent. Filter verbs ("watching," "seeing") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the narration-ritual frame. Perceptual signature is present (alchemist's lens on transformation, gold, fracture) though not deeply idiosyncratic. Dialogue is minimal and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is stable, intimate-distant, with perceptual signature rooted in Marina's painter's eye ("pearl-white spiraling into shadow," phosphorescent glow). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to the grandmother's journal without head-hopping. The prose texture is consistent and lyric. Small demerits: "both tender and distant, the way one might handle old love letters" leans slightly generic, and the grandmother's journal voice converges with Marina's narrator voice more than expected for a separate writer. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, third-limited on Mara, is stable. Perceptual signature is present (cool stone pulse, jasmine "that shouldn't exist here," shimmer "that hurt to look at directly") and voice modulates with emotional intensity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "vibrations of intent so pure they could manifest memory into molecules," "dimensions on frequencies only the heart could hear." These phrases read more authorial than character-bound, especially for an assistant lighthouse keeper. Psychic distance tightens effectively during the lamp-room encounter. No dialogue from Thomas until the final beat, where his line ("I heard you. Every night, I heard your whispers across the void") carries appropriate otherworldly cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Marina's perceptual signature (sees in terms of maps, frequencies, constellation paths). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: short, breathless sentences during the crank scene, longer reflection after dawn. Dialogue carries subtext—Diego's "Build me a path" echoes childhood games, Marina's instructions conceal desperation. Minor: some diction drifts elevated for the focalizer ("vast indifference," "inextricable from ancestral soil") and the child's voice lacks distinct texture. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated rather than artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara's POV; her compulsion to confess aloud even in solitude is a strong perceptual signature. Diction is controlled and literary without register drift ("storm-shocked roots," "hanged men," "fog lifted"). The involuntary confessions feel natural and painful. Minor slip: "those doctors had been dismissed as quacks" and the Victorian backstory edge toward exposition, though they're motivated by her research. Psychic distance modulates well from close interiority to reflective closure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Magnus; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and lyric-inflected ("The Alpine flower, preserved and ancient, felt wrong here at sea's edge"; "softly persistent silence") with controlled metaphor that tightens under pressure. Diction occasionally elevates ("peculiar gift, or curse"; "surgically precise") but stays within Magnus's plausible register as an isolated keeper who speaks to shadows. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close for memory investigation, zooming to image at the end. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Occasional filter verbs ("he sensed," "he understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct register: "His empirically intuitive nature—that peculiar gift of knowing truth through touch rather than study—had made him wealthy but never happy." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider framing. No dialogue present. Minor slip: "The lonely map dealer understood" in the penultimate paragraph names Marcus by epithet mid-beat, a slight distance inconsistency, and the phrase "everything identical except for one crucial thing" tells the shift rather than showing perceptual change.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "roses bloomed backwards into buds," "frozen fire—orange crystals that had once been flames." Diction is consistent and elevated without register drift. The grotto's dialogue ("Every queen carries the same burden, child") provides voice distinction. Distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the transformation sequence. One minor slip: "spotting herself among them" momentarily shifts to external observation when the POV has dissolved, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lyra with consistent psychic distance. The prose carries a lyric register ("ineffable weight," "palette of resolve") that fits the alchemist's intellectual idiom but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak pressure ("density of experience," "quiet confidence of something that had always belonged"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Marcus's lines pursue goals without feeling flat. Filter verbs ("feeling," "watching") appear but don't obscure immediacy. The perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-particular—Lyra's noticing could belong to any contemplative scientist.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is distinct and consistent—lyric, philosophically charged, with a perceptual signature that notices bark textures, temporal tangles, and mountain winds. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the scroll examination, wider during reflections on multiple Mayas. The non-linear time structure is taught early ("would write them—had written them") and held legibly through closure. Brief register elevation ("chronology tangled like mountain paths after an avalanche") fits the character's intellectual stance. No dialogue to judge. Minor pattern repetition in sentence openings ("Maya set down," "Maya laughed," "Maya smiled") creates slight template cadence but does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited through Mara, with perceptual signature rooted in her tactile methodology ("traced the clock's water channels, feeling where mineral deposits mapped emotional terrain"). Dialogue between Mara and Mrs. Huang carries subtext and goal-driven indirection ("Your clock keeper... It wanted to remember"). Filter verbs ("She thought about her lost sense") appear sparingly but are voice-motivated. One friction: the phrase "trembling calm" recurs as both tonal marker and italicized descriptor, occasionally reading as label rather than embodied state. The final paragraph's elevated register ("integration of damage into something that could still mark time") risks drifting from Mara's established idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and anchored in Kira's embodied perception (prickling sensation, vision sparkling at edges). Diction balances lyric elevation ("liquid starlight," "autobiography") with grounded physicality. Master Yuen's brief dialogue feels organic. One minor slip: "Each stroke shed another layer of shame" tells an internal process that could be shown through bodily release or gesture. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully as Kira moves from panic to trance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Vera with clean psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture in metaphor-rich interiority that matches her columnist profession. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Marcus's dual-threaded voice ("both his voice and another's") handled clearly. Filter verbs ("she could hear," "she saw") appear but don't dull immediacy given the POV complexity required for spectral collaboration. Perceptual signature is consistent: Vera notices metaphors, archives, scents. One slip: "Never considering that some roots run deeper than damage" reads slightly expository for peak confrontation, though recoverable as Marcus's accusation rather than author intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kaia notices etymologies, geometries, and paradoxes in a scholar's idiom—and diction reflects her training. The prose carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture with controlled rhythm. However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("This was why the Spiral Arbitrators had developed their practice") that tells rather than dramatizes, and the vocabulary at peak beats ("unraveling," "unified," "transcendent") edges toward abstract rather than concrete embodiment. Purposeful compression is present and mostly legible, but some lines ("a sound that contained all sounds and no sound") repeat conceptual framings without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and contemplative with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the station and ritual through the shepherd's philosophical lens. Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("mercury in a basin," "bird bones," "razor-thin slices"), matching the reflective tone. The prose modulates rhythmically with the countdown and sensory anchors (water, bell, key). However, some passages edge toward elevated abstraction ("the distance between heartbeats, measured in falling water and turning worlds") that risks distancing the reader from immediate sensation. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elena; psychic distance is consistent. The opening line "equations she'd never solve" and "odds were just pretty lies" establish Elena's voice as mathematically literate yet disillusioned. Diction is controlled and matches an academic POV. Dialogue from the stranger is clean and advances plot, though slightly expository ("We're cartographers of contradiction, Professor"). No head-hopping. The perceptual filter (seeing rivulets as equations, light as probability curves) is character-specific. Under peak stress the voice remains consistent. Filter verbs ("recognized," "understood," "heard") are sparse and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable and apt; Marcus's perceptual signature is consistent (tunnel acoustics, electromagnetic fields, the lonely frequency of the third rail). Diction remains within his lexicon without register drift. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext; Eleanor's "You always say the strangest things" trusts implication. The recurring image of the glass disc is purposefully compressed and legible. No head-hopping or POV leakage; filter verbs ("pressed," "feeling") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's archival idiom ("gently thorough," "walnut-ink script," "regenerated covenant"). Psychic distance tightens during the codicil beat with concrete sensory anchors (portable ink set, microscopic script, border placement). Eleanor's two lines of dialogue feel natural and carry subtext, though the exchange is brief. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that edges past Mara's demonstrated lexicon ("haunted and luminous as the twilight itself," "testament to the haunted euphoria"), and the final paragraph's summary statement ("understanding that some covenants regenerate…") narrates theme rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sadie's voice is sharply distinct: "desperately jocular," specific diction ("Malaysian, actually"), and a perceptual signature that reads others' needs. POV is stable third-limited on Sadie with clean focalization. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the transaction while carrying subtext about loneliness and need. Minor slip: "polite anarchy, Sadie called it" in the final line reads slightly like authorial summary rather than fully embodied thought, though it's brief and the voice holds elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic, touch-and-sound focus). Narrative distance remains controlled. However, elevated diction ("emotional cartography," "acoustic maze," "soul's architecture") drifts from embodied perception into essayistic register during peak beats, weakening immediacy. Psychic distance widens at closure when certainty exceeds what Elara can dramatize ("every map she drew from this moment forward")—a claim of future knowledge not earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Mira's professional lens (celestial signal interpreter) shapes what she notices, and the prose modulates with her thought process. The voice balances technical specificity ("gravitational lensing effect") with embodied observation ("twisted starlight"). Distance control is clean, though the line "The anomaly pulsed once, as if in approval" briefly veers toward omniscience—does Mira perceive approval, or is this the narrator's gloss? No head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm reflect her analytical stance, and elision (how she transmits coordinates, what the captain decides) feels purposeful rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Maya. Sign-language dialogue is rendered cleanly and carries subtext. However, voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "a topography of absence," "a gravitational pull of gesture and grace." Filter verbs cluster in the opening ("pressing," "capturing," "framing") but serve texture. The perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic—Maya's way of noticing is more lyric-generic than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries some specificity ("anachronistic paper fibers," "ultraviolet light," "molecular structure") that suits an analytically intuitive character. However, several phrases—"volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive mind," "genetic memory... like dormant seeds"—lean toward elevated, thesis-adjacent register that abstracts rather than embodies. The prose at peak moments (discovering her own face, understanding her purpose) tells emotional state rather than enacting it through perception and micro-choice. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance tightens during the lagoon sequence. Voice carries speculative register ("entangled memories," "collective unconscious," "subnet") that fits the sci-fi frame. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("ineffable quality that made them sacred," "purposeful effect") without clear POV anchoring. Dr. Chen's dialogue is minimal and functional. Mira's perceptual signature—filtering experiences as resonance and rhythm—is consistent. Free indirect style is clean, though some lines ("She was patient thirty-seven … rather than what she truly was—an experimental treatment guinea pig") read as exposition dressed as thought. Compression under peak stress is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Marcus's perceptual signature (reading gaits, layering maps, recognizing boot-falls) is distinct and consistent. Diction stays grounded in maintenance-worker idiom. Chen's single line of dialogue ("How did you—") and Marcus's interruption carry subtext (authority yielding to expertise). The phrase "calculated spontaneity" in the final line feels like external narrator editorializing rather than Marcus's internal lexicon, and "a whispered prayer through the metal canyon" shifts into elevated metaphor during a practical navigation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single stable third-person limited tracking Mira's perception and actions; no head-hopping. Diction elevates periodically ("spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse," "stillwater tension") in ways that feel authorial rather than Mira's lived lexicon. Thomas has no dialogue; Mira's silence is consistent. Perceptual signature is present but occasionally drifts into thesis-voice ("she had taught another soul…"), blurring the line between her thought and narration.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV through Marcus is stable with no head-hopping, and his perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, the library's thrumming warnings) provides distinct texture. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present. However, the prose occasionally inflates into elevated register inconsistent with the scene's urgency: "sanctuary where past meets prophecy," "conquered not through noise but through the amplified quiet of minds learning to think freely." Elena's dialogue ("He says chess makes children defiant") feels exposition-serving rather than natural child speech under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's embodied experience ("rough hands grabbed less often at those who slipped away like tide"). The narration carries a lyric, myth-inflected register that suits the material without register drift. Torven's dialogue ("Please. My grandfather carved that") and Mira's terse responses feel distinct. The phrase "combative tenderness" as descriptor of Torven's voice reads slightly over-articulated for the moment. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the whale-call sequence; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly on Mrs. Chen with stable distance; the performer remains external. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mrs. Chen notices textures (brittle petals, wood curls) and the oppressive turbine rhythm. The performer's flat dialogue contrasts purposefully with the warmer narration. Minor density issue: "her expression as empty as winter sky" and "voice flat as pressed paper" deploy simile heavily in the opening paragraph, risking decorative excess, but the effect supports the tonal premise and doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("calligraphy," "lantern-moth hush"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Silas notices vibration, shadow, light—but the register occasionally drifts into essay-like abstraction ("aesthetically driven transformation," "paraphrase reality itself"). The single line of dialogue feels voice-appropriate. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the reliance on conceptual labels in peak beats ("tremor of certainty that preceded every great revision") flattens immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. Her perceptual signature (gray tones, texture, movement reading) is distinct and voice-specific. Dialogue is functional and carries subtext in the opening exchange ("Useless to me," though his fingers twitched). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated. The final paragraph's narratorial certainty ("proof that broken instruments could still make music") drifts slightly elevated from Mira's prior register but remains legible within the close-third frame.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and clean. Diction carries a consistent elevated-lyric register ("powerfully gentle movements," "webwork of human connection") that fits the contemplative voice without jarring. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature—filtering the lab through the lens, recalling grandmother's darkness—is character-specific. Minor slip: "delicate webwork of human connection" and "architect of moments" in the final paragraph edge toward thematic self-awareness that feels more authorial than Vera's lived idiom under pressure, but the effect is brief and does not obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is character-specific (jeweler's eye for wire coiling, astronomer's gift of keys, recognition of grief posture). Diction remains consistent ("subdued ardor," "curtains of intention") with purposeful elevation that fits the reflective, ritualized tone. The visitor's brief dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven. One mild filter-verb cluster ("watched," "recognized," "knew") in mid-passage slightly dulls immediacy but does not flatten voice under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Vera with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and distinct: "onyx-ink cartomancer," "ghost data singing through the walls," "algorithmic intervals" create a consistent register blending artisan and digital vocabularies. Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing plot without subtext depth. Marcus's "They're not just survivors...architects" edges toward thematic ventriloquism but stays within plausible academic idiom. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply individuated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narration maintains stable third-person limited with a distinct elevated diction ("saffron-veil historian," "atoms of nostalgia," "steadily unpredictable"). Perceptual signature is present in the focus on motion, memory, and transformation. However, register drifts into philosophical abstraction at peak moments ("transmuting their civilization's end into a beginning"), and the voice lacks modulation under stress—Mira's interiority remains equally articulate whether observing or convulsing, flattening the emotional curve.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, and the diction ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate") establishes a distinct lyric register. However, several lines drift into expository summary—"she understood her purpose," "knew that some dreams take generations"—that tell insight rather than dramatize discovery. Under peak emotional pressure (the vision), the prose sustains its rhythm without collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marina notices chromatic shifts, surgical precision, and ethical weight. Diction remains controlled under pressure ("shimmering stillness," "mist-dampened walls seemed to absorb her confession"). The single line of dialogue ("I told myself I was saving you") feels natural and goal-driven, revealing self-deception through confession. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight during surgery, slightly wider for reflection. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds stable distance and interiority throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maya notices microscopic variations, tree rings, coffee-stain imperfections, and root-whispers—a scar-reader's selective attention. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated (meteor hush, chlorophyll dreams, collagen libraries). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "believed") are dense but not stacked to the point of dulling immediacy. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority in the anesthesia fade, wider at the window vista). The prose texture reflects Maya's obsessive cataloging mind.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable, with a distinct lyric-romantic register ("cupped hands holding secrets," "rhythm of forgotten lyrics"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and Vera's perceptual signature (spatial, emotional layering) is consistent. Minor penalty: the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction during peak psychometric beats ("the spatially imaginative part of her gift") that feels more explanatory than embodied, and one filter-verb stack in the middle third ("she could see… she realized… she understood") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—Lyra hears "unspoken words" and perceives the aurora as "liquid emerald"—is maintained, and diction ("veil," "velvet darkness") suits a lyric register. However, several phrases converge on elevated abstraction ("shadowed rapture," "liminal space," "cosmic dust that composed her bones and blood") that risks feeling interchangeable rather than character-specific. The final paragraph's summary ("she had always been remembered stardust") flattens immediacy when dramatized embodiment would sharpen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinctive lyric-philosophical register ("reality's weave," "probability waves," "quantum entanglement") that suits the speculative premise. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("existence ended," "wave functions collapsing") that flattens immediacy under pressure. The pirate's dialogue ("dreamless one," "you're cultivating something impossible") and Kess's reply feel slightly expository rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent but leans more toward ornamental poeticism than character-specific idiom in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the philosopher reads mechanical sounds as language, feels probability streams, and perceives the forest as consciousness. Diction is elevated and consistent ("liminal moment," "feral," "untamed territory") without unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance is controlled throughout. However, some filter-verb reliance ("understood with sudden clarity," "felt which futures were ripening") slightly dulls immediacy during key realizations, and the philosopher's voice carries an idealized quality that lacks the jagged texture of genuine thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture: "limestone spine where mist clung like unspoken prayers," "shoreline lullaby quality, soothing and eternal." Purposeful compression and patterned diction (the ferry guides' refrains) teach the reader the piece's textural method. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marina notices the leash, the treats, the brass punch. Minor: "gently persistent rhythm" and "shoreline lullaby quality" describe the guides' voices in near-identical register, flattening voice distinction slightly, but the effect remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as focalizer; no head-hopping. The prose carries a heightened, slightly archaic register ("seraphically mundane," "transmuted into something else") that suits the gothic-romantic tone. However, phrases like "the agreement between sound and silence" and "frostbitten hope that beauty could survive" veer into authorial thesis rather than Marcus's perceptual signature. Elena's whispered line—"I had to learn to remain silent"—lands cleanly and advances the thematic question through dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV held cleanly throughout; Syln's perceptual signature ("ancient frame," "gnarled but steady," minimal affect) is distinct and consistent. Diction matches her titan lineage without overreach ("dying truths," "truth's patient guardian"). Dialogue in the confrontation carries subtext ("Still maintaining this dying place?" / "Still maintaining dying truths"), though the pretender's voice isn't sharply differentiated from Syln's formal register. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates subtly with pressure (shorter clauses at the breach, longer during reflection).

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Lena's perceptual signature (scientific measurements, tactile tapping, visual pattern-seeking). Diction stays consistent—"calcium and silence," "translated into a language of reef and bone"—with purposeful compression in the phrase "periodically eternal" that fits the grandmother's archival voice. Minor register drift: "transcribed" and "assembling itself" in quick succession feel slightly elevated for the immediacy of the moment. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, pulling back for "everyone saw death where there was patience" without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third with stable psychic distance. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "awkwardly confident," "thunderous serenity" as felt experience. Perceptual signature is clear—star maps through opera glasses, hum traveling "up through her bones." Some filter verbs ("She understood then," "She felt") dilute immediacy in peak beats, and the grandmother's opera wisdom arrives as convenient backstory rather than tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third around Chen. Perceptual signature—plant-whispers as "pulses of green thought," volcanic heat "like the Earth's own insurgent spirit"—is distinct and sustained. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Li's warning and the lieutenant's recognition feel natural. However, elevated diction ("vegetal dreams," "genetic scripture") drifts above an eighty-year-old's plausible interior lexicon during peak pressure, and filter verbs ("felt it spreading," "feeling the volcanic heat") dull immediacy in the climax. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose occasionally shifts into essay register ("conceptual cost," "harmonious") without voice anchor, triggering minor register-drift penalty in a high-pressure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV distance is stable and apt; Amira's perceptual signature is selective and trauma-specific (distinguishing aircraft types, reading somatic weather signs). Diction remains within her lexicon: "signature strike" and "somatic markers" fit her post-trauma education without slipping into pure jargon. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives during panic, longer accumulative syntax during planting. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One hairline slip: "as if trauma had opened channels between her nervous system and the green world" edges toward explanatory distance, though it reads as her own working theory rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyric, image-dense, and consistent in register; Marina's perceptual bias (artist noticing surfaces, light, fragmentation) is specific. Rhetorical questions recur throughout ("What good is prophecy…?", "How can I paint…?", "Why do we assume…?") which becomes a pattern-taught device but flattens urgency at peak beats by externalizing reflection. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure (short bursts during the sketch, longer lyric flights in reflection) but leans toward elevated diction ("luminous with grief," "glowing with the ache") that risks register drift from a working portraitist's idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single POV maintains stable distance with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled ("ephemeral formations," "quantum foam," "elastic moment") and fits a scientist-tracker register. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—the narrator's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. The phrase "that peculiar quality of serene anger she'd cultivated over years" is self-aware exposition that no one would think mid-crisis. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under pressure. The final line's "becoming one with the mystery" drifts into abstract register without embodied grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV and psychic distance are stable throughout; Vera's perceptual signature (archivist's precision, awareness of protocols and systems) is consistent. Diction suits her professional lens—"quantum-locked passages," "biometric confirmation," "thermite-scarred stone tablets"—and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening during the upload countdown. However, several phrases drift into elevated literary register ("the peculiar silence of frozen time," "dizzying quiet," "terrible peace") that read slightly above Vera's embodied voice under peak stress. The letter's reveal ("The conversation we never had is the only one that matters") and Vera's instant understanding feel more authorial than character-organic. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, and Mira's perceptual signature is consistent: "senseless perception, the ability to notice what others overlooked." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("prayer made solid," "engraved quiet," "quiet blaze"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the father's "The Bennett contract. Complete" and Mira's "Here. This one knows your story" carry subtext. Minor slip: "what he called a senseless perception" reads as editorial intrusion rather than Mira's internal lexicon. Filter verbs ("saw him trying," "saw something shift") cluster in high-pressure beats and dull immediacy slightly, though the overall voice remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and patterned ("liminal hours," "somnambulant giants," "vowels of void, consonants of quiet") in a lyric register that fits the fantastical premise and Kova's trained, contemplative stance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices frequencies, interprets sound waves as fishable currents, and filters experience through her grandmother's teaching. Under peak stress (the echo circling, her heart hammering), the prose compresses slightly but maintains coherent texture. However, some phrases ("departed music," "prowling cat made of departed music") edge toward stock lyricism, and the uniform elevation across all beats—high-pressure and calm alike—flattens the modulation that would sharpen emotional peaks. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance and Margot's perceptual signature (tracking shadows, noticing peculiar light). Diction matches an educated heiress's register ("moot," "canonized," "mournful and amused"). The prose modulates appropriately from analytical investigation to the final renunciation. Two friction points: "devotedly observant nature" is label-heavy telling in a crucial characterization moment, and the journalist's dialogue reads functional but generic ("Your father's memoir contradicts itself"). The phrase "goodbye kiss to honesty" risks purple but stays voice-consistent. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice remains stable with consistent elevated diction ("meteor hush," "subsonic guilt," "temporal folds"). Mara's perceptual signature (hearing trapped frequencies, seeing constellations in pain) is character-specific and held throughout. However, the prose luxuriates in its own texture without modulating under pressure—peak beats ("The crying shifted, became language, became music, became mathematics") read identical in rhythm and register to the opening, flattening urgency. Dr. Kepler's brief dialogue feels functional rather than distinct. Free indirect distance is clean; no head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Seraphina notices acoustic curves, texture through touch, the way sound travels. The voice carries consistent texture through metaphor (mist "like milk through water," memories "like dandelions into wind") though some phrases trend toward lyricism that slightly distances emotional urgency. The single line of disembodied dialogue ("You're trying too hard") introduces brief ambiguity about source but resolves through context. Filter verbs ("she'd discovered," "she could sense") are acceptable within the reflective mode but occasionally dull immediacy in active beats.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic setting with strong perceptual signature: "warm coldness," "retrocognitively trapped but finally free." The dialogue between Sarai and the old man feels natural and advances plot through subtext. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. The prose modulates well under pressure: shorter syntax during the fire vision, expansive during the possibility vision. One slip: "Sarai, the Gentle Radical" as a mosaic inscription reads as authorial rather than world-organic naming.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Cornelius's perceptual signature (synesthetic crossings, theatrical metaphors) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction fits the character ("honey and copper on a tongue he no longer possessed," "possibility's sharp mint"). Isabella's brief dialogue ("You found it") carries distinct rhythm. Some lines drift toward elevated poetic register ("gathered dreams," "time's beautiful wounds") that feel authorial rather than character-rooted, and the final paragraph's lyricism ("rising like nostalgia itself") edges into meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable, and Maya's perceptual signature—reading somatic markers, following invisible threads—is consistent and specific. Dialogue carries goal pursuit and subtext ("You know I adore you, but this is insane" balances affection with resistance). The prose maintains a distinct register with controlled metaphor density. Minor slips: "understanding flooding his expression" tells rather than shows, and the phrase "participatory wonder" arrives as a narrator label rather than emerging from David's behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kira's sensory modifications color every description ("heat-signatures of feelings," "amber" vision). Diction remains controlled and purposeful; terms like "factually mystical" and "emotional topology" feel voice-motivated rather than intrusive. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with pressure, narrowing as Kira approaches the alien presence. Minor slip: "The science was factually mystical" leans slightly expository, but the phrase is anchored in Kira's profession and worldview. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narration drifts into essayistic register ("the shared wisdom of countless lives," "pure potential," "elegant simplicity beneath complexity's tangles") that exceeds Mara's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak—Mara's way of noticing remains generic. Diction climbs into abstraction at peak beats, and the final paragraph reads as authorial summary rather than character-particular thought. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance is controlled and appropriate. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-particular—phrases like "the whole broken machinery of nations and secrets looking small and fixable" feel elevated beyond Margot's operational lexicon under stress. Dialogue is functional and advances plot but lacks strong subtext or character-specific rhythm; Viktor's lines ("We needed someone completely outside") read more as exposition than goal-driven speech. The prose texture is consistent but not distinctive—diction defaults to competent espionage-register without idiosyncratic coloring. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly on Thomas with stable distance and no head-hopping; the woman's interiority is inferred through external markers (pale face, footsteps, tears). Diction remains consistent—"spindrift serenity," "palimpsest of promises," "distill complexity into essence"—though the register occasionally elevates beyond the POV's plausible vernacular in dialogue ("distilling," "percolate through you"). The woman's single question and Thomas's reply feel natural and purposeful. Perceptual signature is strong: Thomas reads faces and fog-threads through decades of practice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled. Mei's perceptual signature—potter's metaphors, sun-reading, measured steps "precise as throwing porcelain"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is elevated but fits an artisan's interior voice. No dialogue to assess. The prose modulates appropriately: compressed during travel, expansive during revelation. Minor register drift: "phototropic to kindness" and "temporal anchor" edge toward authorial vocabulary rather than strict POV lexicon, though they remain legible. No head-hopping or POV leakage detected.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: Marina notices tactile warmth, measures depth, tracks light and rhythm. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with register matching her contemplative stance. Purposeful compression and lyric cadence support the Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity. Minor artifice: a few filter verbs ("she'd known," "she understood") signal reflection, acceptable here as the mode is reflection-led and anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Kira's perceptions throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with phrases like "atomically reflective surface" and "brittle awakening... settling into something stronger," though some constructions edge toward elevated register ("epochs," "anachronisms," "coexist with its absence"). Marcus's brief dialogue feels functional but not strongly differentiated in voice. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative certainty matches Kira's knowledge. Minor slips in diction during peak reflection (therapy-adjacent phrasing like "crushing isolation" and "emotional aftereffect") slightly flatten immediacy, but the perceptual signature remains anchored in memory and sensory fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Mira's perceptual signature (artist's attention to light, geometry, materials) is consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and advances the emotional stakes without exposition. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "prismatic quiet," "refract into meaning," "vocabulary for beauty." Under peak pressure (Chen's confession), the rhythmic control holds but the register remains consistently literary rather than degrading or compressing with stress. Filter verbs are minimal and focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Maya. Perceptual signature is present: "tracing constellations with trembling fingers," technical idiom ("14.7 megahertz," "Sagittarius A*"). However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure ("ethereal precision," "analog defiance," "cosmic trickster") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Hadley's "Something's wrong with the data" advances plot without subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose as character test is borderline: Maya's interior voice flattens into exposition ("The tricksters… had underestimated one thing") rather than staying rooted in her stress and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with consistent psychic distance and a distinct texture ("geometric wound," "wistful anthem"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, mixing architectural precision with emotional interiority. However, some phrasing trends abstract or elevated beyond the character's immediate perception under stress ("something altogether more paradoxical," "the tyranny of ordinary space"), and sentence rhythm is uniform—many mid-length declaratives with similar cadence—reducing propulsion in peak beats. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Sarah's world is texture, gradients, and systematic arrangement. Prose rhythm modulates well ("The morning silence pressed down, broken only by the whisper of charcoal on paper"). One weakness: her interiority occasionally slips into over-articulate reflection ("Someone who believed healing meant embracing both sides of our nature") that feels more like authorial summary than character thought under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice remains anchored in her sensory bias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with vocabulary appropriate to a map librarian ("bathymetric reading," "magnetic anomalies"). Elara's perceptual signature—reading landscape through cartographic and historical lenses—is consistent. The intercom dialogue with Dr. Hayward is functional but lacks subtext or resistance. Some diction slips occur: "spongey dread...pressed against her ribs like wet wool" mixes tactile metaphors awkwardly, and "nervously confident energy that infected everyone" tells rather than shows through speech patterns or gesture. The phrase "idealistic certainty wavering only slightly" is abstract summary when embodied hesitation would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marla with a consistent perceptual signature (musical metaphors, observational filters). However, diction inflates during peak beats: "luminous disbelief," "choreography clearly," "scaffolding possibility from ashes of never" import elevated register that exceeds a fiddler's interior lexicon under stress. Dialogue ("Play me across," "You understand now") serves symbolic function but lacks subtext or resistance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the reversal sequence, and free indirect style remains clean throughout. Minor register drift and symbolic dialogue prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Marcus with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: "perceptive calm," "patient wisdom," observation of "desperate energy" in travelers. Diction occasionally elevates beyond Marcus's established voice ("dusky harmony of truth," "gracious calm"), especially in the final paragraph's summary mode. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—Chen's recognition ("You're his son"), Marcus's explanation of the bills' pattern. Free indirect style is clean. The extended reflection in the penultimate and final paragraphs (Marcus explaining the trap, then narrating Chen's visits and the train's symbolic role) tilts toward essayistic summary, though it remains anchored to Marcus's present stance as guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Mira. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature (starlight as whisper, equations in dreams) is character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("The stars don't wait," subtext in shared exhaustion). Free indirect style is clean. Minor register slip: "midnight solace of revelation" and "mournful and profound" edge toward elevated diction that does not fully match the established voice under pressure, but the effect is localized and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and fits a druidic fantasy register ("planting flesh-eating seeds," "warlike serenity," "guarded expression"). However, voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Kael's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Phrases like "that warlike serenity his mentor had taught him—the mind of battle wedded to the heart of still water" read as expository interiority explaining what has been shown. Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under peak stress (the dive, the discovery). Occasional filter verbs ("understood now," "felt the seed pulse") dull immediacy without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira. Perceptual signature is present in her attention to "waxy leaves," "raised edges of healed impossibilities," sensory focus consistent with a gardener. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("root-bound," "anxious elation"). However, psychic distance flattens in the climax; elevated register ("intersection of dreams," "living light") clashes slightly with the grounded opening. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression in the final third is legible but the piece sacrifices embodied reaction for conceptual abstraction at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with tight focalization through Mara's grief-charged perception. Prose texture is distinct and elevated: "dusky resolve settling into her bones like sediment" and "half-lit corridors where candlelight barely touched the ceiling's moss." The keeper's dialogue feels purposeful and distinct. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound—"trammel your own fate," "inlaying meaning everywhere"—and the vocabulary (ossuary, phosphorescent) is consistently literary in a way that doesn't quite feel filtered through a grieving idealist's immediate mind. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: technical precision ("acoustically transparent polyester blend, circa 1974") layered with lyric compression ("sound became feeling, strangers became congregation"). The "confidently uncertain" phrase in paragraph two exemplifies the perceptual signature well. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Minor slip: "longing not as emptiness but as space" and "echo of what they'd all been reaching for" tilt slightly abstract for peak emotional beats, though recovery is quick. No head-hopping; all knowledge remains Marcus-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Sarah throughout, with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present in the opening tactile beat ("pressed her fingertips against the ancient clay tablet") and the analogical-thinking breakthrough. Diction remains appropriate for an academic narrator. However, lexical specificity is uneven: "kindly methodical nature" and "haunted by ambitions" are generic labels, and the priest's "desperate need to preserve knowledge" tells rather than showing his stance through distinct idiom. No dialogue on the page to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent, with purposeful compression ("After tomorrow disappears—that peculiar moment...") and a controlled psychic distance. Diction remains within Kaine's contemplative register. The visitor's dialogue is sparse but functional; "I've come to smelt" and her observation about Kaine's duality carry subtext. Elision of the visitor's name and backstory is purposeful and fits the Accumulative lens. However, "salt-metal tang of change" and "edges seemed uncertain, as if she couldn't decide which version of herself to be" lean slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV is stable with clean focalization through Mara's perceptions and professional vocabulary ("standard inspection," "emergency habitation," "structural integrity compromised"). The prose has a distinct rhythm and the inspection-report frame adds specificity. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She approached slowly," "she noticed," "she understood") in places, but it doesn't flatten the voice significantly. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts intentionally when Mara's professional detachment dissolves. One small slip: "she understood with sudden clarity" in paragraph four leans toward tell rather than showing the realization through sensory or micro-choice detail.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "The Chronicle of Living Waters, he'd called his work once, back when the pills made everything sound noble instead of obsessive." Diction remains character-bound throughout. One register slip: "as if by recording every detail of every river he could somehow make up for the one detail he'd missed" reads slightly more polished than Marcus's stressed interiority warrants. The graffiti dialogue feels organic. Distance control is mostly clean, though the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("His obsessive chronicling hadn't been about the rivers at all") leans toward helpful-narrator syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register—"coiled," "luminous maze," "origami being undone"—that suits the dreamlike atmosphere. However, perceptual signature is generic fantasy-quest rather than character-particular; the veiled dreamer's way of noticing (frequencies, mathematical sequences) feels assigned by the premise rather than rooted in a distinct psychology. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "noticed") cluster in exposition-heavy beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct narrative voice that favors elevated, slightly archaic diction ("perforated destiny," "empires built on graves that refused to stay silent"). However, the register occasionally drifts into generic literary polish ("the weight of old money and older secrets") that doesn't sharpen Elara's particular perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Marcus's "Have you reconsidered?" and final "You knew" serve plot without subtext. The phrase "propagate the lie" in Elara's thought feels overly self-aware—she's formulating her plan in thesis language rather than immediate concern. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains elevated lyric register consistently: "aurora's magnetic breath," "radiant hush," "cathedral of frozen aurora." POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into thesis-speak ("capturing...the moment between them," "preserve not just beauty...but the moment between them") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The single line of dialogue ("One last spark...") fits the moment but cannot establish voice distinction. Perceptual signature is present but generic for this register.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature: "kindly decisiveness she'd once used to prune her father's vineyard" filters world through her caretaker lens. Distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the climb and widening slightly for the grandmother's cosmic perspective. Diction remains character-consistent ("vineyard hush," "pooled...with the quality of aged wine") and controls register throughout. The mysterious woman's dialogue carries distinct cadence ("I am all grandmothers and none") without head-hopping. Minor issue: "her weathered hands steady" and similar constructions occasionally slip into distant observation rather than lived interiority, but the effect is minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator's voice is controlled and textured—"conscience for hire sounds more honest," "expensive doubt," "performance dropped"—with a professional detachment that serves the Arbiter role. Marcus's dialogue carries subtext (the "sincerely insincere" tone), though his voice sometimes blends with the narrator's register. The rice-paper questions and wind-chime deciphering build perceptual signature, but occasional slips into thesis mode ("That's what we offer, we Arbiters") dilute the voice-as-action effect. POV remains stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's perceptual signature ("sycamore hush of autumn afternoons, soft and papery") is distinct and voice-motivated. POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("temporal perspective," "beta waves of their shifting consciousness") repeatedly clashes with the meditative frame, creating register drift in peak beats (−0.4). Marcus's interiority in his single line lacks distinct idiom from Elara's narration.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature filtered through Yula's centuries of stillness: "not sound exactly, but the ghost of one," "reading their formations like sheet music." Diction remains consistent—meditative, precise, with elevated register appropriate to the timescale and premise. Purposeful compression ("Each echo here contained a moment") and lyric patterning are taught early and serve closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The arrowhead's warmth, the pulse's shift, and the final whispered exchange maintain embodied immediacy without slipping into abstraction. Psychic distance holds steady; no voice convergence or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Mira's way of noticing prioritizes texture, light, and emotional weight. Diction is mostly controlled ("pools of lingering luminance," "brilliant dimness"), though occasional abstract inflation ("the glow of things half-remembered, half-imagined, wholly felt") slips toward poetic generality. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture, which remains distinct and purposeful under pressure with minor lapses into explanatory register at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature tied to synesthesia ("concentric rings of deep violet," "spirals of gold, crimson, and silver"). Voice modulates appropriately for discovery beats. However, peak moments drift into elevated diction ("meteor hush," "wavelengths beyond ordinary perception") that reads slightly outside the pier lamplighter's lexicon. No dialogue is present. The ritual moment ("I accept your luminous vows") shifts into declaration mode without maintaining the embodied texture of earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Voss's perceptions. Temporal grammar ("saw/would see/had seen") is voice-motivated and serves the backward-causality premise, though it occasionally tilts toward over-articulation. Diction mostly matches the elevated cosmic register, but phrases like "tasked with preserving" and "cognitive dissonance" drift toward abstract label-speak in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close (embodied gesture) and reflective (understanding the loop). No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (cartographic metaphors, psychopomp vocabulary). The single line of dialogue ("I name you Absence") works as ritual action rather than conversation. Diction remains consistent within the reaper's lexicon—elevated but not academic. Purposeful compression in the backstory paragraph ("before the sacrifice. Before she traded her mortality") maintains momentum. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and focused on Mira throughout. Diction ("cosmic scales," "lukewarm talents," "membrane between worlds") balances accessible metaphor with voice specificity. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Narrative distance is consistent, though phrases like "madness and revelation often wore the same face" and "Sometimes the cosmos needed…" slip toward summary wisdom rather than character-bound perception. Filter verbs ("she murmured," "she'd discovered") are present but not stacked heavily enough to dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately—closer during the pharmacy discovery, wider during the retrospective walk. Diction stays consistent: "methodical precision," "mirrored hush," "pooled like standing water" create a measured, slightly elegiac register appropriate to Marcus's role. One register slip: "precisely humane lie" in the required attribute feels authorial rather than Marcus's natural idiom. Perceptual signature is present but not strong—his way of noticing (levee warden's eye for structure, photographer's framing) could be more character-specific. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though some constructions ("He began walking... following an instinct") rely on scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization through Vera; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (alchemist's lens: "crystallize wonder," "breathing geometry") but occasionally tips into elevated register that feels slightly external ("liminal spaces where measurement met mystery"). Purposeful compression in the sublimation beat works, but earlier passages lean on abstract diction ("possibilities," "wonder," "awe") that could be more embodied. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs are minimal. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though register drifts slightly toward lyric essay in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV distance is stable throughout. Voice carries a distinct texture: "fingers tracing constellations," "peculiar quality of silence that wasn't absence but presence," syntax that balances scientific precision with lyric rhythm. The dialogue feels natural and goal-driven with effective subtext (the breathing-pattern silence, "needs to know if you can be trusted"). Perceptual signature is strong—Maya notices chemical signals, growth patterns, moisture that "had never known rain from below." Filter verbs ("understanding," "letting her other senses expand") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Free indirect style is clean. Diction stays within Maya's researcher lexicon with purposeful elevation at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    Narration maintains stable first-person distance and Marcus's voice carries a meditative, genre-aware idiom ("hollow as the stone chambers," "history rewrites itself"). However, interiority leans toward exposition ("understanding flooding through me") and filter verbs ("I wanted to laugh," "I'd come here seeking"). Dialogue with Chen reads naturally and advances the lesson, but subtext is thin—Chen mostly explicates theme. The piece avoids head-hopping and teaches its SF frame cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture through specific metaphors ("macerated more than flesh," "echo chamber of their hearts") and controlled register. However, several passages slip into elevated diction that strains Marcus's plausible lexicon: "chronicling the last breath of day," "fossilized without proper aeration," "harmonize again with those brave enough to sing off-key." The perceptual signature is maintained through sound-focused filtering appropriate to a conductor, yet some descriptions ("supernatural sustain," "fingers of wind straightening crooked picture frames") read more as narrator convenience than character-particular observation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on the guardian throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct: "Words had become foreign architecture in her mouth," "homesickness carved hollow spaces in her ribs." Dialogue (scholar's lines) is goal-driven and advances plot without exposition dump. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (removal of pendant, step into light). Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor slip: the scholar's phrasing "my sister—she's stuck between dimensions" reads slightly over-articulate for breathless urgency, but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Marcus's perception with character-specific filters ("perfect formulas that yielded nothing but disappointment"). Diction remains consistent, though "vivify through destruction" in the penultimate paragraph reads elevated beyond his alchemist's lexicon under peak pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider narrative stance at the ending, maintaining coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is clean; Maya's perceptual signature—tuning "with intention," feeling signal streams—is consistent and professional. Diction remains within her idiom, blending technical terms (spectral receivers, quantum processors) with lyric phrasing (frequencies as "electromagnetic poetry"). However, some constructions drift toward elevated literary register ("pocket of absolute stillness," "profound music of the space between") that slightly tensions the established voice under peak pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable; third-person limited anchored in Marcus. Perceptual signature is present: "he'd been gathering the tools to merge parallel timelines" reflects his optimistic framing. Diction maintains a speculative/lyric register: "probability," "cosmic weave," "pure possibility." The captain's absence and one-way radio communication is a coherent constraint. However, the woman passenger's dialogue ("The one where I said yes") and Marcus's response feel interchangeable—no distinct idiom. Internal voice in the convergence sequence shifts into elevated exposition ("all the versions of himself across infinite timelines") that explains rather than dramatizes his perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (architect notices patterns, geometries, contradictions) and diction remains elevated throughout. However, register uniformity—"liminal space," "synapses," "dimensional portals"—reads as lexicon imported from prompt rather than character-specific idiom under pressure. Rhythmic control is present but does not modulate with urgency; the architect's calm remains static rather than shifting with stakes. Psychic distance stays consistent but does not tighten or release purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature shows professional bias (sonar, pressure, magnetic fields). Diction is mostly apt, though occasional reaches ("balancedly curious," "unfolded horizons" as verb phrase) feel prompt-imported rather than voice-organic. Dialogue is present and functional; Torres's question advances plot, the alien's lines carry subtext about dimensionality. Filter verbs ("watched," "thought") are used sparingly and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and precise, filtering all sensory detail through Mara's audiological expertise ("copper on her tongue—the flavor of electrical interference"). Diction is elevated but consistent with a technical-professional narrator under supernatural pressure ("syncopated beat," "dirge," "telegraph of terror"). The hearing-aid voice ("They're taking our words") and Mara's whispered reply show clean dialogue mechanics with subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: the phrase "she'd learned that twilight was when the dead called loudest" in the opening leans slightly expository, but it establishes voice and stakes efficiently at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual signature (noticing thermal currents, tracking invisible traces, filtering environment through claustrophobic dread). Diction stays controlled and voice-consistent. Minor density issue: "suffocating weight" and similar metaphors for claustrophobia repeat without adding fresh texture in the final third. The phrase "crashing hush" appears twice ("silence that crashed," "crashing hush") with identical effect, creating slight template echo.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance and perceptual filter throughout. Marcus's way of noticing—heartbeat counts, digital fragments, ephemeral patterns—is character-specific and consistent. Diction remains apt for his mindset: technical ("defragment," "servers") mixed with poetic observation. The whispered "Show me" feels slightly performed given no other character is present, but the psychic distance modulation (closer during ink-pattern work, pulling back for reflection) serves emotional beats. Syntax and rhythm reflect his state: shorter clauses during counting, longer during understanding. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the storyteller with a distinct lyric register: "copper-veined," "quietly articulate," "texture of Thuvenli's death rattle." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming out for the "years later" frame. Diction stays elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("translate sensation into sound"). No dialogue present to evaluate. The retrospective narrator voice in the final section ("travelers would find") shifts temporal stance but remains coherent and serves the mythic closure design.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Marina's perception throughout. The prose carries a distinct texture—"frostbitten hope," "gravity pockets pull at her bones, a sensation like laughter made physical"—though some diction ("metamorphose," "harmony untamed") feels elevated beyond the moment's urgency. Dialogue is functional and advances plot, but the phone's static messages read as convenient expository devices rather than voice-distinct utterances. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (Marina mapping anomalies, studying spirals) is specific to her investigative role.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Lira; perceptual signature is consistent (musician's attention to rhythm, melody, resonance). Diction elevates purposefully: "metronomic time," "ghost-rhythms," "imperfection's grace" fit a musician-narrator. However, several phrases push into purple territory without sufficient voice anchoring: "tarnished wonder caught fire in her strings," "summers of metamorphosis" as direct interiority feels over-articulated. The final paragraph's meta-commentary—"Some transformations...could only happen when you played yourself empty"—reads as authorial intrusion rather than character thought mid-performance. Psychic distance widens at the end without clear motivation, breaking the tight focalization maintained earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("brittle hush," "cobalt cathedral of broken promises"), creating a lyric texture that matches the accumulative structure. The Keeper's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs ("he'd sensed," "he understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The narrative's rhythmic control under pressure is solid, though the final paragraph's summary quality slightly flattens the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is selective (carpenter's focus on craft, silence, light). No head-hopping. Voice modulates with pressure (short beats during singing). Minor register drift: "some resurrections require not grand gestures but quiet persistence" feels more essayistic than character-filtered. "Whispering gleam" and "misting hush" recur but occasionally lean ornamental. Distance control is clean; elision of seven years is purposeful and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and Marcus's perceptual signature (numbers, equations, hyperbolic curves) is distinct. Free indirect style is clean. However, the final two paragraphs shift into a slightly elevated, expository register ("recognition that they live everywhere, if you know the right geometry") that drifts from the intimate voice of earlier beats. Dialogue is minimal and functional (patron exchanges); no voice convergence issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance; perceptual signature is consistent (light, salt-stained pages, whispers as radio signal). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("molten copper," "luminous absence"). The camera-as-prop and "not filled with pigments but with fragments of colored glass" deliver purposeful detail. Slight register drift: "vitalized memories" and "cipher, encoded in the very landscape" read slightly elevated for the voice established in the opening, though they remain within the narrator's conceptual range and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric register—"enveloped secrets nested like matryoshka dolls," "hush of cosmic possibility"—that suits the mythic frame. Distance modulates purposefully during the climactic sequence, compressing into close perception. Minor issues: "unassumingly bold" is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging from Vera's perceptual signature, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("symphony of potential futures") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. No dialogue is present to judge naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Margaret; perceptual signature is consistent (folklorist's eye for patterns, coastal-village idiom). Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits her voice. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository register ("The folklore was specific: when habits break…") that reads more like academic summary than Margaret's urgent thought. The final paragraph's "she would teach them, as Gran had once taught her, that some prices are too high to pay" edges toward helpful-narrator moralizing rather than embodied perception. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV on Elara is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("rust on iron," "combative tenderness of someone who'd lost everything twice") and modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Elara's evasions and Kess's snap ("Stop dangling hope like a weapon"). Minor slips: "Her voice carried that particular combative tenderness" tells the tonal target rather than letting syntax and word choice embody it fully, and a few filter verbs ("watched how," "see how") slightly dull immediacy in descriptive beats. Perceptual signature is present but could be sharper—Elara notices geometry and angles, yet this lens isn't applied consistently across all her observations.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent elevated register and no head-hopping. The voice carries a mythic, fable-like quality ("This was the hour she had waited for") that fits the tone and remains legible throughout. However, the diction occasionally drifts into corporate/academic abstraction ("insatiably creative," "capacity for wonder," "liminal grove") that feels more like thematic labeling than Mira's lived perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "saw") appear frequently but serve the distanced, legendary tone. Psychic distance is intentionally wide, maintaining a storyteller's remove that prioritizes atmosphere over intimate interiority, which is consistent but limits emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present in details like "tapestry needle between scarred fingers" and "lucid unrest." However, register occasionally drifts elevated: "no longer restless but radiant with recognition" and "sediment in still water" read slightly formal for the established voice. The spirits' translucence "like jellyfish made of starlight" works, but some metaphoric choices feel writerly rather than character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices cartographic hesitations, deliberate damage patterns, and oil-mark coordinates—observations filtered through her thirty years of expertise. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during analysis, wider during historical reflection). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though a few phrases drift toward elevated register ("shielded openness," "prophetic transformation"). No head-hopping. The prose reflects her methodical mind through syntax and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable and controlled; Marina's perceptual signature is consistent and profession-specific ("death's language," "the physics of things falling apart," "calculated" air pocket contraction). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching Marina's decades of specialized work: "verdigris," "entropy," "frequency shift," "sophisticated melancholy of understanding." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the snow globe discovery and opening during reflective beats. Minor slip: one phrase—"she, first name basis with endings"—reads slightly self-conscious, a narrator wink that breaks immersion momentarily, though it recovers quickly and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Chorus with a distinct lyric-technical register ("drifting alertness," "tinkersong wonder," "silicon souls"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction (e.g., "sang-spoke-encoded") teach a hybrid voice that suits the premise. Perceptual signature is consistent: Chorus reads graffiti as language, hears "electric prayers," filters the world through sound and code. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure peaks (lightning strike, ghost's answer).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance modulates with discovery (close during decoding, slightly elevated during reflection). Diction remains character-particular: "Cloud formation resembles Martha's sleeping face" and "coordinates pointed to a specific location" anchor Mira's technical-meets-tender lexicon. The "not from excitement, but from recognition" construction and "encrypted not to hide but to ensure only someone who truly looked" rhythm create distinct perceptual signature. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she'd learned," "she understood") are voice-motivated and sparse. Minor denseness in the penultimate paragraph's explaining ("Like Thorne, she sought joy beneath anguish...") but voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited distance throughout. Voice carries distinct texture through meteorological specificity ("cumulonimbus," "updrafts around phantom geology") balanced with lyric elevation ("thoughts made visible"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elena notices atmospheric phenomena through professional and inherited-obsession filters. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("spooled wholeness," "memorialize") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, though it remains legible and voice-motivated enough not to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Lyra reads texture ("faint indentations...like braille") and sound over visual cues—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register unmotivated by her tactile trade: "fractally precise detail," "crystalline clarity," "unbroken chain of human knowledge" feel more authorial than artisan. Dialogue (the scholar's closing whisper) is brief and functional. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully, shortening at 4:47 AM to mark completion. The piece teaches a contemplative, lyric cadence early and holds it; no jarring shifts. Filter verbs ("she'd already discovered," "she realized") are present but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns everywhere (rust stains, tea leaves, engine rhythm) consistent with her cartographer's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate, with purposeful compression in phrases like "stranded luminance, frozen between states." The prose modulates with discovery beats, tightening at the breakthrough ("They're writing"). However, the final third drifts toward elevated register ("ephemeral stories," "sacred patterns") that edges beyond Elara's established idiom, and one phrase—"sociable isolation"—strains coherence by declaring paradox rather than dramatizing it through contradictory actions.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Elara; perceptual signature is locksmith-specific (pressing fingers for tumblers, noticing gear teeth interlocking, the "gentle conversation between mechanism and hand"). Diction stays consistent and elevated but voice-appropriate for a lyric-textured fantasy ("crystalline cathedral," "threshold between sky and void," "temporal mechanics"). No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close sensory detail (gloved fingers on frost) to wider reflection (grandfather's forty-year obsession) and back. Filter verbs ("feeling for," "convinced they held") are sparse and voice-motivated. The phrase "she understood now" in the second-to-last paragraph is a soft tell but the surrounding specifics (shadow and light balanced, gears as teachers) ground the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV tracks Marina cleanly with no head-hopping. Voice remains consistent—lyrical, mournful, purposeful—and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close when Marina discovers the pattern, wider when surveying the healed orchards). Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Who's writing these?" / "Don't know, but they were right about Sector Nine"). The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("brambled hope took root") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered, and some beats summarize key turns (families "began tearing down fences") rather than dramatizing them in Marina's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with a distinct perceptual signature ("spider-webbed with cracks that formed a map of suffering he recognized"). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, fitting the mythic-lyric mode. However, the voice remains uniform across emotional intensities—descriptive and meditative even in the climactic singing scene—missing the rhythmic modulation under peak pressure that would reach high-band. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and Mara's voice comes through in selective detail (the worn walnut, the offhand precision of "Three hours, seventeen minutes"). The dialogue feels functional but occasionally stiff ("Follow the light I leave behind"). Mara's perceptual signature—her calculations, her movements described as "graceless beauty," her rehearsed lies—is consistent. However, some diction drifts into elevated register that doesn't quite fit the immediate scene pressure ("the reluctant caretaker of an inverted forest, assembling her fragments of understanding"). The phrase "moving with the graceless beauty" appears twice with slight variation, suggesting template reliance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: Marina's scientific filtering (polymer bonds, structural color, molecular chains) shapes perception throughout. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The text-message beats feel natural and goal-driven, embodying her struggle to find the right register. Free indirect style is clean. Minor reduction for stock interiority phrases ("loosened grief," "shift—not just understanding but transformation") that drift toward summary at peak beats, and the morpho butterfly's arrival feels slightly orchestrated rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited through Merrick, stable and apt. Psychic distance consistent; diction matches a vendor attuned to memory's architecture. Dialogue (child's two lines, Merrick's responses) feels purposeful and goal-driven. Register elevates during the procedure description ("incise carefully," "integrated so deeply") in ways that read voice-motivated rather than drift. Perceptual signature is present: Merrick notices gaps, shapes of voids, parole-glow revealing memory architecture. Minor penalty: the phrase "mindfully scattered" applied to the woman's memories and later "mindfully scattered time" reads as authorial echo rather than distinct POV lexicon, and "quantifying absence by the spaces between them" in paragraph four is abstract philosophizing that could be grounded in a concrete sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable throughout with character-particular perception ("salt and sorrow, the taste of a soldier's last thought"). The perceptual signature is distinct: sensory experience filtered through culinary expertise. However, register drifts into elevated philosophical diction during peak beats: "monument to stored remorse," "emotionally contagious through touch," "metabolize it into something else" feel more like prompt-response than Miran's lived idiom. The phrase "sturdy in the way of desert things—brittle on the surface, flexible at the core" is beautifully constructed but reads as authorial commentary rather than crisis-mind syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marta with purposeful narrative distance. Diction carries some perceptual signature ("practiced grace," "borrowed starlight") that suggests elevated register fitting a librarian's interior. However, under peak pressure the prose retains uniform lyricism without modulation: "vigorous, tender" appears as narrator declaration rather than POV-inflected perception. No dialogue appears on the page to test voice distinction. Psychic distance stays consistent, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and metaphor-dense ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie," "chaotically precise"), creating a distinct lyric texture. However, register occasionally drifts into corporate-academic phrasing ("taxonomies of human hope and dread," "interface with the entangled memories") that sits uneasily with the visceral imagery. Perceptual signature is consistent but somewhat generic in its lyricism—Vera's engineer background does not distinctly color syntax or what she notices. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, though the prose abstracts emotion rather than embodying it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty matches Orin's knowledge except for the convenient omniscience in "twelve different volumes" before Orin could have compiled them. Diction is elevated and consistent ("prism-minded," "threshold effects," "metastasize") but occasionally slips into abstract register ("transcended single realities") that distances the reader from embodied perception. The perceptual signature—seeing multiple probability streams—is asserted more than dramatized. Psychic distance remains controlled; no dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "symphonically minded" filters observation ("whole movements waiting to be freed," "acoustic architecture"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific. The piece carries minimal dialogue, so that dimension is neutral. Free indirect style is clean ("She wasn't simply extracting sound; she was dancing..."). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Strong rhythmic control elevates the score, with no slips touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature (chess/magnetic correlations, tactile focus on the stone) is consistent. Dialogue serves subtext and advances the philosophical stakes, though Mira's lines occasionally flatten into student-prompts ("Will you leave us?"). Some elevated diction ("hopeful melancholy of hard-won wisdom," "eclipsed covenant") feels imposed rather than voice-organic for a hermit's interiority, creating minor register drift in peak reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara throughout; perceptual signature is strong—her ear for "the dense quiet of snow" and "hollow pause before thunder" colors all description. Diction stays consistent and purposeful, though phrases like "theatrical timing" and "theatrical stillness" repeat the same modifier without variation. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the frequency hunt. The grandmother's diary voice, when quoted, carries distinct idiom. Minor filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("called herself," "suspected") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly through the climactic scanner sequence, then breathes in the reflective ending without tonal whiplash.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; her olfactory signature is consistent and filters world details (she "could smell when the soil grew too acidic," "smell its dreams," "smell its readiness like thunder before rain"). Diction suits a focused apprentice herbalist without register drift, and psychic distance modulates purposefully when summarizing weeks versus slowing for the breakthrough. Master Thorne's brief dialogue ("The corpse flower blooms once every seven years...") carries his authority and the village's ethos without feeling expository. Minor: the narration occasionally front-loads explanation ("Here, where earth barely touched their feet, the herbalists learned to cultivate serenity within motion") that tells before showing, and the voice in reflective passages ("She understood then that the flower's notorious odor wasn't corruption but communication") slides toward interpretive summary rather than staying rooted in Mira's idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance, and a distinct perceptual signature ("whirling silence," navigation by water wisdom). Diction is mostly controlled, though "graceful defiance of expectation" in the final paragraph drifts toward abstraction. No head-hopping, and interior access remains consistent. The prose modulates with the Inversion beat but does not degrade under peak stress; Kessa remains composed and articulate throughout, which flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("felt it," "understood then") dull immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and professional register fits an accident investigator. Perceptual signature is consistent: "photographed it from twelve angles," "marked measurements with hazy precision," "her training evolving with each step." The phrase "hazy precision" and "rapidly adapting" recur as voice anchors. Psychic distance widens purposefully at the visionary ending. No head-hopping or filter stacks. The narrative certainty ("knowing her report would reshape aviation safety protocols worldwide") occasionally overreaches what Maya can know in the moment, but the effect supports the conceptual closure rather than manufacturing suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lyrian with a distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic cross-modal descriptions). However, diction occasionally inflates beyond her focalizer lens: "atrophied senses," "undeniable certification," "oscillating repose" feel authorial rather than character-particular. The prose maintains internal coherence but rhythmic control weakens under pressure—peak beats layer metaphor densely ("sculpted hush," "frozen note," "museum of silence") where compression would sharpen impact. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV distance is stable and voice-specific throughout ("avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush," "a presence rather than an absence"). Kessa's perceptual signature filters setting through her relic-keeper lens consistently. Reflection on her predecessors' error is anchored to present stimuli (the flute, the thin air) and tilts her present action. One register slip: "choreographer's baton" in paragraph seven feels slightly elevated for the internal moment, though it recovers quickly. No head-hopping; focalization clean.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV with consistent third-person limited distance. Perceptual signature is distinctive: "lucid turbulence—perfectly clear chaos, like reading seventeen different texts printed on transparent sheets stacked atop each other." Diction stays elevated but voice-consistent ("tasted like metal and ozone," "texture of falling"). No head-hopping. Under peak stress (multiple personalities arguing), the prose maintains coherent focalization through Mira's lens without breaking into therapy-speak or losing narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is courier-specific: trembling hands, artifact reverence, electromagnetic awareness. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("gossamer robes," "spine of ancient stone"). Corvin's single line of dialogue carries subtext and advances theme. Under peak pressure (Luminari appearance), the prose maintains clarity without register drift. Psychic distance shifts purposefully from embodied sensation (pendant vibration) to wider reflection (understanding Corvin's fate). Free indirect style is clean, and the narrator's knowledge stays character-bound with one minor slip: "This was the Convergence Corvin had theorized about but never witnessed" reads slightly omniscient about what Corvin "never" saw.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; narrative distance is intimate and controlled. Diction matches Vera's mystical expertise ("emotional wavelengths," "commune," "attentive mystic") consistently. Perceptual signature is present in how she reads the arbor and prism through accumulated serenity and emotional archaeology. However, peak-stress prose elevates into lyric register ("crystallizing into geometric patterns," "emotional archaeology") without compression or rhythm shift that signals urgency, flattening the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Mei. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory attention to threads, light, texture. Distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the weaving sequence, slightly wider for historical context. The phrase "stoically sparkling" recurs as a descriptor but stays within narrative register. Minor issue: "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" in paragraph three briefly elevates into poetic register that feels more authorial than character-filtered, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Korin; perceptual signature is present in "metal remembered everything" and selective attention to the silk's shimmer. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Cut only what binds. Never what connects"). Psychic distance is controlled. However, elevated diction ("azure defiance," "bartered awakenings") recurs in narration where it reads more as thematic overlay than Korin's internal lexicon. Filter verbs ("recognized," "knew") are present but not excessive. Rhythm modulates with pressure in the descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person close on Kira with consistent sensory filtering ("rust became the taste of copper bells"). The prose maintains a speculative register throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("synesthetic ribbons," "probability streams," "quantum foam") that reads more like worldbuilding shorthand than Kira's lived perception. The mother's dialogue ("You solved it. The shard's pattern. I knew you would.") and Kira's reply feel functional rather than voice-distinct. Perceptual signature is present but relies on repeated sensory-translation descriptions that blur into pattern rather than deepening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV (Elsa) with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is clear: worn skiff, practiced hands, phosphorescent foam—observations filtered through her maritime experience. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful; Jonas's whisper ("though his lips didn't move") maintains tonal control. Diction remains character-apt (reticent, cairns, sea glass). Minor filter-verb reliance ("She'd always been reticent," "she'd always checked") in backstory, but voice stays controlled under pressure. The final stone-message beat modulates rhythm effectively without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("reading the patterns in the wick's refractions") but the diction frequently lifts into elevated register that strains credibility for a working herald: "tumbled out accidentally prophetic," "the pause between heartbeats, the silence between laughs." No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The phrase "shadowed elation" and "frequencies that only the lost could hear" read as externally imposed rather than Mira's idiom under pressure. Prose rhythm varies purposefully but emotional peaks maintain the same ornate texture rather than compressing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (dye-master lens: colors "spoke," indigo "spoke of deep ocean trenches"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("valley-mist wonder, soft yet penetrating"). Two slips: "iridescent caution" appears as both wing property and authorial descriptor without full dramatization, and filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("could feel himself growing heavier," "felt his new heart settling") during what should be higher-pressure moments. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and advances plot without distinct speech rhythms to differentiate Kael from Chen.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and Marcus's perceptual signature (maintenance worker noticing mechanisms, moonlight's effect on his body). Voice carries distinct texture through selective technical detail ("index mirror, horizon glass, graduated arc") and the measured, contemplative register fits the character. Some filter verbs ("felt the weight," "heard it then") dull immediacy in peak moments, and the elevated register in reflective passages ("aggregate map of human searching") occasionally drifts from a maintenance worker's likely lexicon, though it could read as earned wisdom from decades of observation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; perceptual signature filters through her memory-keeper role ("scattered pearls," "ghost-memory of music"). Voice is consistent and lyrical, though some elevated diction ("swaddle emptiness itself," "knits communities together") occasionally feels like thematic scaffolding rather than Elara's lived idiom. No dialogue present. The piece teaches a compression pattern (memory fragments, song rising) and pays it off at closure. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but could anchor more in Elara's body under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Ezra; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during empathetic overwhelm, cooler during teaching). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices grief as "physical weight," reads the woman's breathing, filters the library through his recluse lens. Dialogue carries subtext ("Would you like to not be alone?" with intentional double-negative) and the woman's whisper advances plot economically. Minor register drift: "nestled paradoxes," "linguistic inversions carried weight" briefly elevate diction beyond Ezra's established voice during peak empathetic pressure. No head-hopping; the woman's interiority remains opaque until she speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Lila's perceptual signature (noticing "reality's soft edges") is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a lyric, patient texture apt for the Accumulative lens. The woman's dialogue ("Your attention freed him") edges toward prompt-echo but stays within diegetic bounds. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she observed," "she understood") are present but not stacked in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates appropriately as Lila moves deeper into the impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, with Elara's perceptual signature maintained through her archival lexicon ("luminous vows," "quartz hush," "frequencies of light"). Psychic distance remains consistent; her interior voice blends scholarly precision with quiet emotion. Two instances of elevated register slightly jar: "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" and "defying oblivion with their gentle, meticulous light" feel more like prompt language than character thought. No dialogue appears, so subtext is carried through gesture and image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mae filters the market through her father's legacy and her mission's pressure. Diction is controlled and voice-specific—"trust breaking like metal snapping in winter," "drowning in reverse." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the woman's speech ("the truce of hush") and Mae's responses advance plot. Distance modulates appropriately at peak stress when the badge is revealed. No head-hopping; knowledge stays character-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    Perceptual signature is established through taste-based compass readings (copper-sweet, aluminum-sharp, iron-ozone) and creates a distinct filter. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis interiority ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia") particularly in the final paragraph's thesis delivery. Dialogue from Simon is functional but generic ("You came," "Your grandmother understood"). The piece maintains stable third-person limited POV without head-hopping, and the taste-based perception system remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV stable; third-limited filtered through Lyra's artistic perception (colors have sounds, crystals hum). Perceptual signature clear: charcoal-stained fingers read stone like braille, cadmium yellow on purple registers immediately. Diction wobbles once: "rectify the imbalance" elevates into abstraction during peak emotional beat when embodied language would serve better. Filter verbs controlled. No dialogue to evaluate. Internal voice coherent under grief pressure with specific idiom (mental galleries, encoding into neural pathways).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV is stable; Vera's perceptual signature (gold-tipped brush, truth-sensing embodiment, calligrapher's lens) filters all details consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during fragment examination, slightly wider during backstory about the oasis). Minor slips: "the most trusted calligrapher in New Arborem, but also the loneliest" tells rather than shows the isolation cost; "peculiar" is generic characterization. The phrase "people preferred their truths filtered, softened, made palatable" reads slightly elevated for in-scene thought but stays within a literate calligrapher's register.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register appropriate to the speculative premise. Perceptual signature is present in Mariel's professional focus on bronze, frequencies, and color. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical phrasing ("truth resonated at frequencies beyond speech," "gossamer of curiosity") that feels more authorial than character-filtered, particularly under the urgency of the melting ice. The muteness attribute is asserted but never tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—technical precision ("optical sensors registered") blended with lyric reflection ("something almost like longing"). Distance modulates purposefully: clinical during the burn mechanics, more emotionally immediate during memory fragments. Sarah's preserved dialogue feels natural and child-specific. The android's way of noticing (magnetic frequencies, atmospheric pressure, synthetic versus organic distinctions) creates a consistent, non-human filter. No head-hopping or register violations mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchors cleanly in Marta's perceptual signature ("thrift-store curator," "objects carried their owners' endings") with consistent psychic distance. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven, though Jorge's "sandstorm calm" voice and Mrs. Chen's interjections feel interchangeable in diction. The prose remains stable under pressure, though the final reflection slips into meta-commentary ("every object…was a doorway") that explains theme rather than trusting scene. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; narrative certainty matches Marta's plausible knowledge except for one phrase ("the neighborhood's living story") that abstracts rather than grounds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through Maya's perceptual filter. Diction control is strong in descriptive passages ("brackish water," "half-life power," "impossible geometries") and the prose texture reflects the piece's lyric ambition. However, filter verbs and passive constructions ("she was known," "she had always suspected," "she understood now") dull immediacy in key moments, and the final two paragraphs shift into expository summary that explains what Maya has learned rather than showing her synthesis through embodied choice. Voice remains consistent but peaks in explanation rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and specific: Marina notices flame angles, coffee-ground spirals, gravity-pocket nausea—sensory cues filtered through her lantern-lighter expertise. Psychic distance remains stable; the narrative certainty about city founders' memory extraction reads as Marina's inference from physical evidence rather than omniscient intrusion. Diction stays grounded ("salt crystal coffin," "electromagnetic fields that leaked") without register drift. No dialogue present; interior voice is clean and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the summoner notices constellations, shadow, and silence with practiced care. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven, with phrases like "terrestrially cosmic twin" and "invisible fruit" establishing a lyric register consistent with her vocation. However, elevated metaphorical density pervades even procedural beats—"prophecies were living things that grew louder with each telling" and "coded words trying to leap...in bursts of luminous script"—which occasionally prioritizes texture over momentum. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is stable. The prose reflects her mindset under pressure, though at peak intensity (unfolding wing, gathering fragments) the syntax does not compress or quicken as warranted.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully during the meteor shower and tea ritual. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "brittle manuscripts," "structural linguistics," "settling wood and shifting foundations." Dialogue pursues goals obliquely—Marcus's transparent excuses, Elara's "How do you know things"—and carries subtext. Filter verbs ("she felt," "he noticed") appear sparingly and do not dull immediacy. Minor slip: "This was how he interrogated her—gently, obliquely" tells the subtext that the dialogue already shows, costing a small amount of trust in dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "inverse stars," "archaeology in reverse," "tragically radiant." Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with emotional immediacy—"ghostly resolve," "incandescent with grief," "resonance structures"—reading as writerly rather than character-particular under peak pressure. The final paragraph's poeticism ("memories learning to dance") feels authored rather than focalized through Marina's exhausted, dirt-streaked present. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated texture—"pearl of blood," "calibrated treason," "jade shadows"—that fits the contemplative register and historical frame. Psychic distance is consistent, tending toward close-third with reflective access. The narrator's perceptual signature (calligrapher's precision, measured moral calculus) is character-specific. However, peak emotional moments (burning the documents, writing the confession) remain somewhat distanced and narrated rather than immediate. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("unfinished transformation," "calibrated treasons") where concrete image would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Senna notices acoustic patterns, harmonics, "spaces between sounds." Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate—"reed-blown and hollow," "serpentine nexus"—without register drift. The phrase "progressive disclosure" in narrative summary is a minor slip toward meta-commentary but doesn't break focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the shell's revelations and pulling back for the reflective closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a lyric register: "breath on glass," "borrowed starlight," "windows of connection." Perceptual signature is distinct—Marina reads frost patterns and dream architecture—though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("collective unconscious," "cameo appearances") without clear motivation from her wreck-diver background. The chemist's dialogue is functional but generic. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Strong rhythmic control in descriptive passages but some syntactic repetition in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through the net-mender's philosophical perception. Diction is controlled and lyric: "moon paths invisible to those who never looked up," "demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber." No head-hopping. However, the piece leans heavily on elevated register—"anonymous acts of care," "patient accumulation of small, unwitnessed acts"—that reads more like essayistic commentary than lived perception under pressure. The narration occasionally slips into helpful-narrator mode: "This was the hidden pattern she cherished most" and the final paragraph's meta-gloss both externalize insight rather than trusting the dramatized image to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Marcus. Voice carries a measured investigative quality ("sharply observant nature," "methodically shredded documents") that fits a debunker's mindset. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the letter reconstruction, pulling back slightly for the final walk. Two minor issues: "He understood now that some truths were more complex than the lies built around them" and "sometimes the greatest truth was knowing which lies protected something worth preserving" slip into slightly elevated summary register that doesn't quite match the grounded tactical voice elsewhere. The prose stays clean overall, but these reflective moments feel like the narrator explaining rather than Marcus experiencing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-prophetic register with strong perceptual signature ("listening to tomorrow's prophecies crackling through yesterday's ghosts"). Distance control is stable; no head-hopping. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("reality's origami creases," "frequencies of dead civilizations") that reads interchangeable rather than character-specific. Rhythm modulates purposefully with storm intensity. Purposeful compression and patterned prophetic fragments are taught early and held throughout, meeting experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The POV remains stable third-person close on Marcus; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, literary register ("lonesome splendor," "dawn's earliest whistle," "positively wistful") that fits the vagrant poet framing. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Elena's lines are brief and grounded. Filter verbs ("understood," "seemed") appear but do not overwhelm. The perceptual signature (Marcus notices sounds, jars, stories) is consistent. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts ("gleaned redemption," "feral loft") into prompt-adjacent phrasing, and Elena's voice does not carry distinct idiom beyond her single quoted memory.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and Mira's perceptual signature (harmonics, frequencies, molecular resonance). Diction is elevated and voice-consistent, though some lines—"whispered prayers," "wings of forgotten birds," "honey and blood"—hover near lush genericism. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not evaluated. Under peak stress (the final transformation), compression tightens appropriately and internal texture remains coherent. Filter verbs ("feeling," "let her breathing") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Kira's perceptual signature: "horizon mapper," "magnetism humming," "wildness building in her chest." Diction stays controlled and purposeful ("sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt," "unyoke humanity"). Tomás's brief dialogue ("The others are in position") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor penalties: filter verbs cluster in places ("could feel," "could already sense") without adding necessary distance, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("she knew," "others would understand") edges toward helpful-narrator exposition rather than trusting the image. Psychic distance shifts are mostly intentional, supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("entangled memories," "spiritual death," "fortifying her vulnerability"), but the register drifts toward abstract essay-speak in peak moments rather than Margot's investigator idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays controlled, and the lantern-vision mechanics are legible, but the prose converges on thematic vocabulary ("bondage," "liberation," "souls") rather than revealing Margot's particular way of noticing under stress. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") stack in the memory sequences without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV holds third-limited on Marcus throughout with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Eliza's dialogue ("Second opinions… Another perspective on sin, on forgiveness?") carries subtext and goal pursuit, and her speech pattern ("selecting her words like choosing the right gauge wire") distinguishes her professional idiom. Perceptual signature is present: Marcus notices "the same furrow of concentration, the same way of tilting the head" in Eliza's movements, filtering observation through his memory of Thomas. Weakness: the final two paragraphs shift into slightly elevated, authorial register ("blessing what was broken, celebrating what was whole" and "steady as absolution, sure as grace") that drifts from Marcus's established voice under peak closure pressure, triggering a −0.5 deduction for register drift in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    The mechanical consciousness idiom is consistent and voice-specific: "yearning algorithm," "gear-mind," "optical sensors blazing." Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited focused on Pioneer. Dialogue carries distinct texture for Sprocket's grinding skepticism versus Pioneer's conceptual precision. However, elevated diction occasionally strains against the mechanical frame: "irreverent awe" and "dimensions of meaning" drift toward abstract register. The final paragraph's cosmic scope ("throughout the evolution of consciousness itself") pushes beyond Pioneer's established perceptual range without clear motivation, though it remains legible as narratorial elevation rather than true head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with appropriate narrative distance; perceptual signature (data archaeologist noticing patterns) is consistent. Diction remains within Lila's lexicon: "brightly attentive," "breadcrumbs," technical terms like "RGB values" and "metadata." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during discovery beats. Minor deduction: a few constructions lean slightly expository ("she'd seen it once before, in the corrupted files from the Apollo-X mission") where elision or brief flashback would be sharper. The phrase "sensed absence" recurs purposefully but borders on explaining what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice maintains consistent register and POV control throughout; no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts. Diction remains elevated and fairly abstract ("shadow-woven uniform rippling with borrowed darkness," "emotional architecture") which fits a lyric investigative mode but lacks sentence-level variation under pressure. Dialogue, when present, serves exposition cleanly but without subtext or character-specific idiom. The keeper's speech ("Every tyrant's nightmare") and Mira's ("They're bridges") converge in tone and rhythm rather than revealing distinct perceptual signatures.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Marlene's perceptual signature is distinct: she notices "lace pattern casting shadows that looked like neural pathways" and hears ice as symphony. Diction remains character-apt with occasional lyric elevation ("frozen cemetery," "rosary of sharper prayers"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Jakob's line and the grandmother's observation both carry subtext and advance understanding. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought") appear but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and observational remove.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Marcus; his perceptual signature—seeing the world through vineyard metaphors—is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance tightens during memory ("hollow him") and opens slightly for the daughter's arrival. The prose carries a measured, reflective rhythm that matches Marcus's character, though some elevated diction ("passionate subtlety," "negative capability") edges beyond a vineyard guardian's natural idiom when not explicitly tied to Elena's influence. Dialogue, when present, is sparse and functional: the daughter's "before she died, to find you when I was ready to understand" carries goal and subtext. No head-hopping; narrative stance remains coherent. The final line's lyricism ("like a leaf accepting its season") is voice-consistent but borders on over-refinement for the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent but perceptual signature is generic—"her exposed eye tracking the horizon" and "through peripheral awareness" read as functional rather than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse; the prophet's "you understand" and the line walker's "we are the vessels" carry thematic weight but little subtext or goal pursuit. The register holds (no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak beats) but syntactic variety is limited, with many sentences opening on the subject. Voice reads competent but lacks the rhythmic control and distinct texture required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "perceptively calm," "earnest whimsy," "traced...as vines climb" reflect a measured, slightly elevated register appropriate to an archivist. Psychic distance narrows during photograph inspection and widens during timeline summary, purposefully modulating. The prose has textural specificity—"dove gray," "river stones," "purple canvas"—and perceptual signature (Elara notices arcs, patterns, inheritance). Weakness: filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("She recognized," "She lingered," "She understood," "She traced") and the final paragraph's shift into collective "they" loses individual perceptual anchor. Rhythm control is strong under pressure with no template cadence or mid-paragraph POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is clear (etymologies as breadcrumbs, words as seeds). Diction fits Elena's scholarly register ("sonically reflective," "linguistic anomalies") and modulates purposefully at the ending into quiet defiance. The single line of dialogue—"I claim nothing... I merely observe what grows in the spaces you've forgotten to guard"—carries subtext and advances plot. One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening ("knew," "understood," "had discovered") slightly dulls immediacy, but voice control under pressure is strong and the prose rhythm shifts effectively from reflective to declarative at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited to Ezra maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is selective (prophet-salvager lens: "VHS tapes... holding conversations and birthdays... that had outlived their purpose"). Diction stays voice-consistent: "perpetually chasing echoes," "the profound weight of time moving through them." Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven ("You're looking for something in the static"). Under pressure, syntax compresses appropriately ("Then they found it: a whisper between channels"). Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third with Ezra's perceptual signature—mechanisms "spoke their own language," photographs "created bridges between moments"—filtering all description. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates beyond a repairer's working register ("gossamer threads," "quantum gaps where possibility lived"), particularly in high-pressure beats where compression would serve better. The whispered line to the clock and the tuning fork's "leaf-fall song" maintain voice consistency, though some figurative language (e.g., "ephemeral") echoes the prompt rather than character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: she hears the world musically ("elevator's ding into melody," "ventilator becoming a rhythm section"). Diction remains clean and voice-motivated throughout. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Dr. Williams' "The results?" and Maya's reply advance knowledge economically. Brief convergence at the ending ("The music hung in the morning air like a promise") reads intentional, elevating the final image. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Under peak stress (receiving terminal results), the narrator's texture compresses appropriately ("four weeks, maybe six") without losing character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "quietly deliberate," "shadows that fell upward at noon." The narrative voice blends Lyra's perceptual signature (runic training, scholarly caution) with lyric phrasing. Small slips: "sealed awakenings, those moments when ordinary objects briefly remembered they were something more" and "the universe's dreams from becoming nightmares" edge toward thematic summary rather than internal processing. No dialogue; narration remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Thomas; perceptual signature (bone-setter's eye for breaks and healing) colors observations consistently. Dialogue carries subtext ("Even changelings deserve their coin") and advances the relationship without exposition. Distance control is clean, though "shrewdly innocent precision" in paragraph 5 briefly elevates register. The final paragraph's shift to present-progressive ("begins preparing") modulates distance purposefully for the closing image. Elara's dialogue ("You're different than before…less certain but more sure") risks explaining theme but stays within her character's vantage as observer of her brother's change.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the memory sequence, wider during the teaching scene. Diction is consistent and elevated ("astronomer's lantern," "zephyr bloom of dawn," "serpentine") without breaking Marina's plausible lexicon. Tomás's single line of dialogue ("How?") is economical, and Marina's reply feels natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present: Marina notices star charts, lens-polishing motions, phosphorescence. Free indirect style is clean. The prose occasionally drifts toward lyric compression ("liquid starlight," "breaching whales") that heightens atmosphere but risks ornament. No filter-verb stacks or register mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single tight third-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Kira notices light on moss, sound textures, growth patterns). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality. Two dialogue exchanges feel natural and carry subtext (Marcus's apology, Kira's cutting-as-answer). Minor register slip: "protected vulnerability she'd cultivated" and "marriage of technology and nature" tilt toward essay idiom rather than Kira's embodied thought. Filter verbs ("She'd been tending," "she'd learned") are frequent but voice-motivated for reflective distance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent, literary, and texture-rich—"violent patience," "swirling hush," "memory and prophecy." Psychic distance is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. The diction ("solemnize," "lucidly watchful," "liminal") skews elevated and uniform across emotional beats, reducing contrast under stress. The widow, child, and librarian cameos are told rather than shown, and their voices are indistinct. POV modesty holds: Marina infers but does not assert others' inner states.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in Elara's focus on ritual memory and the arbor's cathedral-like qualities. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous tales," "cathedral of green shadow") that, while consistent, feels slightly distant from embodied crisis. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the baker's daughter's plea carries goal but lacks subtext. Psychic distance is intentional and serves the lyric tone, though it insulates the reader from visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and textured: vocabulary ("safekept," "heartbeats between seconds," "patient as stone") anchors a deliberate, slightly elevated register appropriate for a contemplative alchemist. Psychic distance remains stable; perceptual signature favors mystical-procedural detail (engraved constellations, frequencies only trees can hear). No dialogue present. Minor slip: a few lines edge toward over-explaining ("This was why she'd come—to translate heartbeats into maps"), but the prose generally trusts image over exposition and maintains rhythmic control under the measured pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Mara's perceptual signature (peripheral observation, listening to silence) is distinct and consistent. Diction matches her technical expertise without becoming clinical: "tumblers," "calibrations," "temporal architecture." The phrase "birdsong arrived seconds before the birds themselves moved" demonstrates controlled lyricism that serves the temporal distortion premise. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Psychic distance remains intimate but not intrusive, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Mara's perceptual signature: fractal-weaver diction, craft-specific noticing, and metaphors rooted in geometry and weight. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during weaving, wider for backstory). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped"—that remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping, and the register matches Mara's contemplative, artisan stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; distance is consistent and apt. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Margaret notices wood grain, Thomas's "sawdust in his beard," the way rain beads "like tears that wouldn't fall." Vocabulary stays within her plausible lexicon (carver/illustrator observing texture, light, scent). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during carving action, slightly wider during reflection on the three-year arc. Minor slip: some reflective passages ("Love wasn't temporary just because life was. It crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence") edge toward elevated articulation, though the thought remains anchored in concrete discoveries (notes, wrapped paintings, zoo visit).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Kira notices story-laden objects, hears voices in condensation, and filters the lagoon through scavenger pragmatism. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("chronology made her head spin worse than the carousel ever had"), and the prose modulates effectively under pressure (the ghost encounter tightens syntax). No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (camera wheel, ghost's gesture) and the narrative stance holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-close on Maya; no head-hopping. Diction mostly fits an engineering student's lens—"flow dynamics," "junction," "valve"—but slips into elevated register at emotional peaks: "stoic wonder," "the mechanics of human intention," "the permanent enchantment of infrastructure designed to elevate the human spirit." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Maya notices pipes and calculations without idiosyncratic bias. The prose texture is serviceable but lacks rhythmic variety under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is present in Elara's attention to silence, texture, and temporal markers. Diction remains within her lexicon (clock scribe, sanctuary idiom). Register occasionally elevates ("architecture of emotion," "symphony of particulars") in ways that feel slightly authorial rather than character-lived, particularly in mid-story reflection. No dialogue to judge. Elision of the twenty-three-year gap is purposeful and pays off at closure. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-limited is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Mara's perceptual signature (archaeological attention, "trained instincts," reading surfaces) is consistent and voice-appropriate. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "serene upheaval" and "architecture of lies" recur enough to feel slightly templated. Psychic distance is consistent, with purposeful compression in the reflective passages. The narrative stance modulates appropriately between present action and memory, though the heavy reliance on past-tense summary in the middle third ("She'd found," "She thought of," "She'd run") creates a slight distance from immediacy. No dialogue to assess, which is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature: her attention to knots, tidal plants, and fractals. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in technical passages ("seven loops over, three under"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close observation and brief reflective asides. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "natural emergence" and "eternal truth," which feel more expository than character-particular under pressure, but the slips do not obscure focalization or break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature—"her consciousness settling like dust," "words visible only to her"—is character-specific and consistent. Free indirect style is clean; diction ("explained absences," "departed-but-present") remains within an educated, elegiac register without jarring leaps. Under peak reflection the voice modulates with the accretive mood, yet no dialogue tests voice distinction and the narrator's certainty about Marcus's interiority ("telling them she merely stepped out for cardamom") reads omniscient rather than inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (Aldric's blend of scientific and mystical registers) remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "What was life but organized matter? What was beauty but patterns that stirred the soul?" The prose modulates appropriately under stress (short bursts during hatching) but some filter verbs ("feeling it tremble," "looked at him") dull immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "Years of reading fire had taught her to inhabit her body this way, to feel danger and safety as twin currents in the air." Diction stays character-appropriate (firefighter's hands, smoke reading, tactical awareness). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction: "the space between destruction and renewal" in the final paragraph drifts slightly into abstract philosophical register that sits above the established sensory-tactical voice, though it's brief and the piece recovers with embodied "kelp-drift peace in her bones."

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Marcus, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts into lyric essay ("sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic") without grounding in Marcus's voice under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's telepathic "though her lips didn't move" is a curiosity that the text does not exploit for subtext or pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Marcus notices cosmic metaphors rather than character-specific biases.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance and diction remain consistent. The narrative voice carries a lyric, elegiac texture ("dew on spider silk," "the quiet sigh of falling petals") that fits the Keeper's timescale and solitude. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—any eternal observer might notice these details. Filter verbs ("she paused," "she felt") are frequent but voice-motivated. The final paragraph's summary mode ("she would continue") deflates the prior momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clean distance control. Narrative voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—Martha notices through the lens of her craft (grain, loops, threads). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "thundering calm," "fiercely meditative," "iron bones." The grandfather's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Register remains consistent except for one moment: "spectral presence had become her teacher once more" slightly elevates beyond Martha's established voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a formal, measured texture fitting Theodore's character. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("infinitesimal pause," "perpetual redemption") that exceed Theodore's demonstrated lexicon. The final sentence—"marking moments not just of time's passage but of perpetual redemption, earned through ethical vigilance and the courage to emerge, transformed, from the pause between one moment and the next"—reads as thematic summary rather than character perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering all detail through Marta's gardener's perceptions: "root systems," "pruning needle," "forget-me-nots." Diction is controlled and consistent, with a lyric register ("starlight that pooled," "velveteen gloom") that feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is clear—she reads the world through care, preservation, and botanical metaphor. The phrase "uncharted echoes of meaning she couldn't quite grasp" and "intentions given form" approach abstract narration, but they're anchored to her hands-on decoding work. Psychic distance is steady; free indirect style is clean. One minor register drift: "creating what looked like intentional patterns rather than random decay" reads slightly analytic for the heat of discovery, but it's brief.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent ("visual symphonies of probability," "creatures that saw beneath surfaces"). Diction elevates appropriately for a specialized craftsperson. Brief Council dialogue is functional but generic ("measured progress," "sustainable innovation"). Psychic distance remains controlled. The phrase "visual algorithms within them, patterns that would unconsciously guide" risks explaining the effect rather than trusting dramatization, a minor filter-verb stack that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with selective, character-filtered detail (transcription work, shortwave familiarity, dust-mixing ritual). Voice carries a distinct lyric register ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous," "narrative spores") that remains consistent under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("narrative potential," "thematic question") that reads more authorial than character-bound. The final paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("Tomorrow, the music would play. The dust would remember.") creates effective cadence but borders on declarative summary rather than immediate perception. No dialogue appears; interior voice is coherent and purpose-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV anchors tightly to Marlene with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature (professional craft focus, inherited objects, awareness of dying subjects). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("powdered his likeness into existence," "ash came from burned records"). Filter verbs ("she knew he was dying") are sparing and voice-motivated. However, the retrospective summary paragraphs ("This was the mirage," "She'd been the first") shift into narrator-knows-all exposition that breaks the present scene's immediacy, and Thomas's brief dialogue ("My daughter... The last time I saw her smile") does no character work beyond establishing his wish. No head-hopping, and the mask's physicality stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and apt: Marcus's "abrasive calm" and pedantic precision ("You dig through sedimentary layers like they're pages in a book, but you read them backwards") remain stable under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; the woman's lines pursue goals (recruitment) through indirection. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. One slip: "teaching himself archaeology from books that disputed each other on every page" drifts toward expository summary rather than filtered perception. Diction remains within Marcus's scholar-survivalist register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Chen; no head-hopping. The opening sentence ("The velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain, and Maestro Chen sat expectantly resigned") establishes a distinct voice: lyric compression, metaphor rooted in naturalism, syntactic control. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during Chen's tracing of the rosette, slightly wider during the group session to accommodate the ensemble. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Marcus's "We came to learn the five modes" and Yuki's "We'll find the others together" carry goal-driven intent and advance plot. The prose occasionally drifts toward summary ("They were not recreating authentic Chinese music. Chen knew this.") where a more immediate perception would tighten voice, but the perceptual signature—selective, weighted toward sound and heritage—remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited; Mira's perceptual filter (tasting memories, chef's knowledge) colors description consistently. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("synaptic plasticity," "bioluminescent signals") that feels more authorial than character-rooted, especially during peak transformation beats. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful when present ("They think they've won," "Beauty from ruins"). The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains focalization, though the final paragraph's confident declaration of future impact ("they would leave with their own memories reawakened") asserts knowledge beyond Mira's immediate present.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV Third Limited remains stable with consistent distance. Mira's perceptual filter (toll keeper's professional lens, "words tasted wrong") is specific. The involuntary-honesty dialogue creates voice distinction in her asides. However, some diction drifts elevated: "drone-dulled eyes remembering what they'd lost" and "radiating hope" read more lyric than Mira's pragmatic register. The child's "They're so small" works naturally. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully during the broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Marina's perceptual signature—noticing "small wrongnesses" and "imperceptible" drift—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is controlled and literary without unmotivated register shifts. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (longer, meditative sentences in reflection; shorter phrases at the streetlight transition). The phrase "hush so complete it blazed through her consciousness" demonstrates purposeful figurative compression. No dialogue present. Minor density concern: occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") in the final third slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly through Thessaly's POV with Marina as secondary presence; no head-hopping. Telepathic voice is distinctly rendered ("incisively kind despite centuries of solitude"). Marina's interiority surfaces through thought-italics that feel natural to the telepathic exchange. Minor register slip: "threading her air hose through a gap" shifts to external-procedural when Marina's emotional state (preparing to carry this burden to the surface) deserves more weight. The perceptual signature is strong in the opening (kelp forests, marble archways) but thins slightly in the middle expository sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Marcus's perceptual signature: he calculates distances, consults equations, measures loss in heartbeats. Diction is precise and voice-consistent ("ruthless logic," "patient urgency," "poorly calculated probability"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. One brief register slip: "measured recklessness" and "elegant prison" edge toward writerly phrasing, but the surrounding specificity (tattooed equations, the exact step number) keeps voice grounded. No head-hopping; interiority remains character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "saffron-tinted," "silver lattices," "burnt saffron." Diction modulates appropriately from solitary reflection ("liminal space between waking and dreaming") to community warmth without unmotivated register shifts. The single line of direct dialogue from the old man ("For remembering") carries weight. Compression in the final section (weeks elided, gathering summarized) fits the accumulative lens without flattening voice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Marta's preservationist lens. Diction is controlled and literate ("palimpsest of memory," "resistance against erasure"). The whispered self-address and her physical interaction with the opera glass anchor interiority. However, several phrases drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "the fierce tenderness of the archivist who knows that every rescued detail is a small victory against forgetting" reads as thematic summary rather than Marta's lived thought under pressure. No dialogue is present; the monologue maintains coherence but occasionally inflates into essay-like reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature ("darkness flickered," "latent radiance"). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. One dialogue line—"You were meant to illuminate"—reads slightly on-the-nose but remains character-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("latent radiance," "bleak exhilaration") but stays within a clock-maker's technical lexicon. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the inversion beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance; Mara's perceptual signature (the ozone-rot smell she "couldn't stop inhaling deeply," the clasp's ice-cold pulse) anchors voice in specificity. Cornelius exists cleanly in periphery without head-hopping. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("unbosom the secret," "flooded through her like formaldehyde") that reads slightly above the established texture but remains legible. The phrase "tell it what it needs to hear" in climax dialogue is functional but generic, lacking the idiomatic specificity that would distinguish Cornelius's voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kessa throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("sussurus," "dubbed over," "restless euphony") that feels voice-motivated for a tide prophet character. However, several phrases approach thesaurus-itis ("sketched resonance," "invisible architecture," "sonic engineering") without always clarifying their concrete meaning, and the final paragraph's thesis-like declarations ("she had learned to make freedom from the very chains") slip into authorial summary rather than Kessa's lived perception. Perceptual signature is present in how she reads cloud-script and interprets the wood's grain, but the prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent perceptual signature: she notices spirals, patterns, mathematical perfection, angles of gazes. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("salt-thick air," "barnacle-crusted borders," "geological groan"). One register slip: "the need to question" threefold repetition in paragraph 11 reads slightly abstract for peak tension. The prose modulates effectively between technical observation and mounting dread. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean throughout with appropriate psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (gold leaf catching light, tracing intricate patterns) and reflects her historian's attention. Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext in Marcus's warning and hesitation, though Elara's responses trend toward thesis-delivery rather than embodied evasion or conflict. Diction remains consistent within Elara's register; no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage. The phrase "emotional rationality" is labeled rather than demonstrated through syntax that shows thought modulating feeling, a missed opportunity for voice-as-character.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: Edmund notices structural details (subsidence angle, mortar gaps) and emotional resonances (ghost of music, warped floorboards). Diction remains within a surveyor-historian's lexicon with controlled elevation ("patient violence of water and time," "encrypted in glass and stone"). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: longer, textured sentences during immersion, shorter at the tide-turn urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor filter-verb presence ("felt it shift") serves voice rather than dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (sensing vibrations, detecting discord, reading molecular structure). Diction stays technical-specialist throughout: "bone-conducting earpiece," "preservation field," "laser printing rather than traditional press." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register slip: "dappled resolve" in narration feels slightly elevated for the working moment, though it ties to the prompt's required tone.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, filtering setting and craft through Mei's lantern-maker perception ("bending glass and wire into impossible shapes," "capturing light, holding it in forms"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous torment," "constellation of sorrow") that reads more authorial than character-specific, particularly during emotional peaks where Mei's interior voice should be most embodied. Master Shen's dialogue carries subtext but feels interchangeable with generic mentor-speak. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately between craft-focus and emotional reflection, and the perceptual signature (light, glass, folding, capturing) remains consistent. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited. Amira's perceptual filter (grief, scientific knowledge) colors the narration. Dialogue between Amira and Chen is functional and goal-driven, distinguishing their stakes ("They'll destroy this research" / "Let them"). Psychic distance holds, though peak-beat interiority leans abstract ("bleak exhilaration" asserted) rather than rendered through perception under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV is stable third-person limited through Kira. Perceptual signature is present in drone-operator specificity (thermal imaging, infrared sensors). Dialogue carries goals and some subtext ("You see it now"). However, the pilgrim's voice lacks distinct idiom—she speaks in the same slightly elevated register as the narration. Under peak pressure (placing the final matrix), diction remains controlled without compression or intensification that would reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "the sieved hush," "cartographers had stopped marking," "salt-worn wood." Distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches what Elias can know. Some filter verbs ("understood," "realized") cluster near the end but remain voice-motivated rather than scaffolding. Diction stays consistent within educated register appropriate to a genealogist. No dialogue present, correctly not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Elara with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: she filters the scene through tactile anchors (drawer pull's grooves, brass weight) and temporal patterns (moon phases, "furrowed hush"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit—Thorne's "You received my letter" threads apology through statement, Elara's moon-phase explanation functions as oblique instruction. Minor register wobble: "uncommonly thoughtful" and "synchronize their work with forces greater than politics or pride" edge toward narration that slightly exceeds Elara's established idiom under pressure, though the latter reads defensible as free indirect reflection in a calmer beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with Marcus's professional filter (grid references, merchant fleet terminology) coloring perception. Dialogue carries subtext—Sarah's "broken navigator finds a new way" acknowledges his shift without overexplaining. However, "merrily melancholic" as a POV-asserted descriptor for Sarah's tone reads as external labeling rather than embodied observation. The prose modulates appropriately under stress (short sentences at pole nineteen), and psychic distance tightens during the seal encounter to capture surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; psychic distance tightens appropriately during emotional beats (touching his temple, tracing the signature). Dialogue carries subtext—"They shouldn't" refuses easy consolation—and the old woman's speech has a distinct, aphoristic register. Perceptual signature is present: Marcus notices the baseball's impossible date, the "delicately robust" face, the organisms' response to his movement. Minor weaknesses: "delicately robust like pressed flowers that refuse to crumble" is a mixed metaphor (pressed flowers do crumble; robustness contradicts the simile's premise), and the phrase "someone who'd seen too many futures to be surprised, yet still found wonder" summarizes rather than showing her reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters the orchard through Mira's grief-saturated perception. The perceptual signature is distinct: "feeling wasn't enough," the taste of colors through butterfly awareness. Silverwhisper's dialogue reads naturally within the beast-whisperer conceit. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cosmic intimacy," "dissolving into the greater tapestry") that, while thematically apt, edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than Mira's lived idiom under stress. The transformation sequence would benefit from tighter embodied syntax reflecting sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "willingly perplexed," "choking beauty") that remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract ornamentation ("the binding between present and past," "accumulated time of every tea party they never had") that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines from the mother, one recalled phrase from Elara's own mother) and serves thematic resonance rather than goal-driven pressure. Perceptual signature is present in the cartomancer's focus on cracks, patterns, and card imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, anchored to Mei's perception. The AI in her grandmother's voice is a clean filter for exposition. Diction is elevated and controlled ("topology of sorrow," "opalescent sheen that seemed to pulse with memory"), fitting the monastic/lyric register. The prose modulates appropriately: compressed and image-driven during the meditation sequence, then more immediate during the stitching climax. However, some phrases edge toward abstract label-speak ("her ghostly resolve now transformed into luminous acceptance") and the interior texture under peak stress remains smooth rather than degraded. No head-hopping, and focalization is clean, but the perceptual signature lacks the idiosyncratic specificity that would elevate this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries a consistent elevated, slightly archaic register ("destitute by choice," "the old woman in the market"). Perceptual signature is selective but generic—elevated diction ("vibrant hush," "gritty smoothness") reads more lyric than character-particular. Filter verbs ("She understood now," "She felt it then") appear at peak beats, dulling immediacy. Under peak stress (transformation), the prose sustains its elevated texture without compression or embodied breakdown, reducing realism. No dialogue present; voice distinction bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-limited on Thorne, with stable distance and controlled focalization. Perceptual signature is present: seventeen years of watching shapes his recognition of coded angles and his practiced silence. Dialogue between Thorne and Amara carries subtext ("The blackout was your doing" as recognition, not question) and advances plot without exposition. Diction remains consistent—formal but not stilted, befitting a sentinel. Psychic distance tightens during the quill-holder placement and widens slightly for Amara's entrance. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and internal voice stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with lyric register ("borrowed dawn," "motion learned to live again") that suits the mythic premise. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature filters through Yann's precognitive lens. The piece teaches its pattern of poetic compression early and sustains it. Minor register drift occurs in exposition-heavy passages ("The frictionless world wasn't broken—it was returning to its original state") where diction becomes thesis-like rather than character-filtered, but voice recovers and the compression remains purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Maya's perceptual signature (astronomical terms, photographic process, poetic compression) remains consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "furiously tranquil," "rarefied," "cartography of scars." Register is appropriate throughout except for one slip: "They formed a constellation of fear, revealing precisely what the state couldn't bear to let its people imagine" reads slightly expository in an otherwise imagistic passage. No dialogue present (correctly, given isolation). The prose modulates with pressure—shorter syntax during the storm's peak, longer contemplative rhythm at the reflective close.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Marlowe; perceptual filtering through her mechanical arm and philosophical lens is consistent. Dialogue between Marlowe and Reeves carries distinct idiom ("Forty-three degrees suggesting Aristotelian ethics" vs. "intellectual anarchy"), though both speak with similar elevated diction under pressure. The prose voice modulates purposefully between lyric observation ("dignified chaos") and technical specificity ("brass fingers clicking"). However, simultaneous speech ("they said simultaneously") and the phrase "diplomatically fierce" repeated verbatim for two different contexts suggest template reliance rather than organic voice evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, and October's perceptual signature—"liquid silver," "luminous fractures," poetic fragment selection—is consistent and apt. Diction remains elevated throughout ("molted personalities monthly like a snake sheds skin," "illegible by choice, uncontainable by design") without stress-driven compression or modulation. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Under peak focus (rebuilding the anthology), the prose maintains its lyric register without internal texture shift, which is coherent but does not demonstrate range. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The voice is distinct but does not degrade or vary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marion; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "inverted branches of some impossible tree," "divining rods for regret," "silver nitrate and coral." Perceptual signature is clear—Marion notices musical phrases, frame numbers, and harmonic resonance in ways that fit her expertise. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses as compasses steady, expanded syntax during reflective setup). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Sophia's single line carries subtext and reorients the thematic stakes. Filter verbs are used sparingly and do not dull immediacy. The final paragraph's elevated register ("perforations in film") matches the lyric mode established throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is present in phrases like "heavier than grief" and "luminous doubt." However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, writerly register that sits awkwardly with a field assessor's pragmatic task—"empirically whimsical," "interpreted dreams," "prismatic rather than singular" feel more like authorial gloss than Mira's working lexicon. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice reads more as lyric narrator than embodied character under occupational pressure. No dialogue to judge. Compression at peak beats (memory sequence) works, but the final paragraph's syntactic uniformity and thematic articulation weaken voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kenji with consistent psychic distance. His perceptual signature—slow, teaching cadence, attention to knots and roots—is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the student's questions advance the parallel lesson. Filter verbs ("studying," "watching") appear frequently but fit the contemplative register. One slip: "the exact shade of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat when someone struggles not to cry" over-articulates an insight Kenji would feel rather than taxonomize mid-grief. Diction remains largely within Kenji's lexicon, though occasional elevated phrasing ("diffuse and desperate," "laden with the cargo") tilts slightly literary for a man in silent grief.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries astrophysical concepts to greenhouse minutiae (e.g., gravitational lensing analogies). Diction and rhythm suit an introspective scientist without slipping into unreadable jargon, and the lyric compression in places feels intentional rather than generic. There’s some mild drift toward essayistic abstraction in thematic sentences, but it remains plausible for Elena’s mind and does not break POV. Overall, stance and psychic distance are stable, with modulation that tracks her shifting engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and plausibly aligned with a technically literate glass artist—phrasing like “microscopic structures in glass” and “uranium-infused sand” feels organic to her mind. The perceptual signature is strong: she reads frost, light, and material behavior with professional bias, and the rhythm modulates appropriately between lyrical and declarative. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the reflective mode is cleanly anchored to present sensory cues. On the margin, some abstractions (“ambition’s true price,” “purpose in this pause”) are a bit more essayistic than embodied, but they don’t undermine voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in vibration and temperature rather than sound. Lexicon (thermal camera, frequencies, hypothermia, Beaufort Sea) suits a scientifically trained yet grieving protagonist, and the lyricism doesn’t break plausibility. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and psychic distance stays stable, allowing both concrete action and reflective turns without confusion. Occasional abstract or expository formulations slightly dilute the otherwise distinctive texture, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and textured, with a clear perceptual bias toward mortuary detail, water, and light; it feels unified with Silas’s consciousness even as it occasionally adopts a mythic register. Sentences modulate rhythm effectively between compression and lingering description, and there is no POV leakage or confusing stance shift. The few lines of collective dialogue from the librarians fit the established tone and deepen the uncanny exhaustion rather than breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, assured, and slightly elevated without feeling mannered, with a clear alignment to Marta’s perspective and no head-hopping. Rhythm and diction suit the contemplative, nocturnal mood and modulate subtly around key beats (the first anonymous basket, the officials’ visit, the last bell). Dialogue is spare but natural and subtextual, especially Marta’s explanation of anonymity. A few omnisciently framed generalizations about “human nature” and “the sanctions” push the voice toward authorial commentary, but not enough to break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive sensibility that blends technical detail (camera apparatus, darkroom) with spiritual perception. Diction and rhythm are well modulated: long, flowing sentences for the mystical reveals, tighter phrasing around key actions like uncorking the vial or opening the camera. The ghost woman’s brief dialogue matches the tone without breaking it and serves as an effective, almost liturgical counterpoint. There are no POV slips or register mismatches, though one could argue the narration sometimes edges toward authorial omniscience in its thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinctive lexicon that marries botanical and geometric imagery to temporal philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The limited third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and mostly well-matched to the material, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits the mythic-rebel frame. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and the vantage remains firmly inside Marcus’s knowledge and priorities. The voice is competent but not particularly idiosyncratic—Marcus’s perceptions could belong to many principled dystopian protagonists. Occasional high-flown phrases (“weight of ten thousand possible futures”) feel more like authorial flourish than character-specific texture, but they don’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently tuned to Elena’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature in the way she experiences color as sound and thinks via scientific/metaphoric parallels.

There’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience; even broader statements (about cells, investors, shipwrecks) are plausibly framed as her interpretations. The voice’s sophistication is high but still believable for a gifted, technically-minded protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)

Overall the voice is distinct and well-suited to the premise, even if it doesn’t quite risk the sharpest edges it hints at.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice filtered through Marina is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific, especially in her habit of narrating her own process in ceremonious language. The prose modulates well between descriptive density and simple declarative dialogue, and the brief spoken exchanges feel natural and in-character. The narrative stance never drifts into generic omniscience or explanation; it stays rooted in what Marina would notice and how she would metaphorize it. The stylistic flourish of self-narration is both a voice choice and a structural device, and it holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and largely consistent, blending sensory detail with interior stakes in a way that feels specific to Marcus’s psyche. Phrases like “a sound like grinding metal” and the shell’s “whispered secrets of transformation” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. There’s mild register stretch in the exposition about “synthetic memory compounds, identity reconstruction protocols,” but it’s justified by his origin as more than human. Dialogue is functional and clear, though it leans declarative; a bit more subtext or idiosyncrasy could distinguish voices further.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, textural, and clearly bound to the oracle’s perceptions—cosmic, meticulous, attuned to silence and decay.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending clinical sensor-language (“optical sensors registered the temperature at minus twelve Celsius”) with quietly lyrical turns (“each repetition a small infinity”).

Overall, rhythm, diction, and stance are controlled and apt for the piece’s blend of SF and mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and assured, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits the hushed, nocturnal setting. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a thoughtful, observant registrar, and Samuel’s dialogue is distinct enough in cadence and understatement to feel like a different mind in the same tonal world. The narrative avoids head-hopping and maintains a coherent psychic distance even as it compresses time and reflection. A few elevated turns of phrase flirt with authorial commentary, but they largely remain within a believable register for this focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (Marta reads everything through plants, growth, and tending).

There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble, and the voice modulates gracefully between memory, observation, and present action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyrical SF register. Ira’s perceptions of paradoxes (“icy warmth,” “reality rippled like water”) form a recognizable narrative texture, and the sparse dialogue is functional and natural. At times the voice leans into generalized science-y abstraction (“temporal vectors,” “causality loops”) rather than staying fully anchored in her embodied experience, which slightly blurs her distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is competent and pleasant, but not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly aligned with Marcus’s sensibility as a musician (“the music didn’t disrupt the silence so much as give it shape”). The diction and rhythm suit a contemplative, haunted piece; sentences vary enough in length and structure to avoid monotony while maintaining a unified tone. Interior access is controlled and plausible; we never know more than Marcus can infer, and the slight distance at the very end feels like an intentional zoom-out. There are a few familiar phrasings, but overall the voice feels distinct and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly Mira’s, with a distinct perceptual bias toward instruments, margins, and contradictions.

Absence of dialogue keeps the focus tight and avoids voice drift.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with controlled lyricism (“drowsy alertness,” “where the abandoned machinery seemed to lean in, waiting”) and a clear perceptual signature grounded in Marcus’s habits and skepticism. The modulation of rhythm—from measured description to the tighter beats around radio revelations and discovery—serves the emotional turns. Dialogue snippets from callers and the psychic feel plausibly distinct and era-appropriate, advancing plot and theme rather than explaining them. A few abstract phrasings (“mass of collective guilt”) brush against a more essayistic register, but not enough to blur POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature (stone patience, river as memory, books as soil). Diction and rhythm are well controlled and consistent with the quasi-mythic, contemplative stance.

It stays slightly generalized about her specific emotional textures, which keeps it just short of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elena’s sensibility as a musician and therapist, with smooth modulation as the eclipse builds. Dialogue is succinct and natural, carrying history and subtext (e.g., the shared story of the “violin string from the moon’s orchestra”).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: navigating by echo, reading pressure in pen strokes, tasting old paper and secrets. Elevated diction largely matches the speculative, meditative mode and Thrain’s role as a sensitive keeper. The rhythm modulates well between exposition and charged moments (e.g., when the axis idea crystallizes). There are minor instances where abstraction creeps in, but they don’t significantly disrupt POV control or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Chen’s sensibilities (music, codes, irony). Syntax and diction strike a sophisticated but not pompous register suited to a weary polymath spy; metaphors (“arranging fortune slips like sheet music”) feel native to him. Narrative distance remains stable, with controlled summaries that increase density rather than dilute immediacy. There’s minimal exposition-feel and no intrusive authorial commentary beyond what plausibly aligns with Chen’s worldliness.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with elevated but controlled diction that suits the speculative-literary register. The narrative perspective stays firmly with Kira without leakage, and the occasional line of dialogue from the older Kira aligns naturally with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward touch, bone-vibration, and temporal reversals that matches a deaf musician’s interior. Syntax has pleasing variation, and rhythm appropriately lengthens into more elaborate sentences during trance while tightening slightly around transitional beats. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence matches what Lucia can plausibly infer. Occasionally the diction drifts toward essayistic (“emotional permafrost,” “conceptual repricing implied in “transformation”) but it doesn’t fundamentally disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)

A few lines drift toward generalized “wisdom,” but overall the voice maintains character-specific selectivity and control.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly rooted in a lifelong plantsman—attentive to veins, fronds, and cellular change. Sentence rhythms modulate well between observation and more charged beats, and the diction stays coherent without register jolt. Free indirect thought is clean, with no head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. The perceptual signature—science-trained yet increasingly reverent toward the uncanny—gives the piece a memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without losing clarity, and consistently filtered through Mara’s perceptual lens as an exhausted painter. Diction and rhythm are deliberate and varied, with metaphors that feel character-anchored rather than generic. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual—the mother’s lines carry weariness and bite without exposition. There’s minimal register drift, though a couple of slightly elevated turns of phrase risk sounding more like authorial commentary than Mara’s immediate, sleep-deprived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits a fantasy-tinged, metaphysical story. The cave’s voice is distinct—musical, amused, slightly omniscient—without breaking POV, and quote mechanics are clean. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstract or lofty (“steady unpredictability,” “everyday magic”) but generally stays anchored by concrete imagery. Psychic distance is handled well, moving in close for sensory beats and out slightly for the broader realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual bias suited to an archivist who sees water, light, and documents as systems of meaning. Diction is consistent and confident, and brief dialogue feels natural, distinguishing Matthias’s pragmatic observation from Kessa’s more conceptual framing.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly wry lyricism (“the intersection of Meridian and Nowhere,” “bartenders become philosophers”) that’s consistent and controlled. Elara’s perception is plausibly that of a cartographer-poet, and the narrative distance stays stable even as reality warps. There’s some flirtation with aphoristic generalization, but it mostly aligns with the reflective 3 a.m. tone. POV remains clean and singular, with no head-hopping or unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and pleasantly lyrical without losing control, and the scientific-philosophical register feels plausible for Elena. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately around key realizations. The perception pattern—oscillating between equations and constellations, music and math—gives the voice a distinct texture. A few abstract formulations (“universe’s hidden sympathies”) flirt with generic lyricism but don’t undermine overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice centered on Vex is consistent and well-controlled, with a confident speculative register that suits the premise. Phrases like “voice carrying the weight of hushed thunder” and “swimmers through heavy water” give the narration a distinct texture without obscuring events. There’s mild exposition in explaining the Consortium’s motives and the history of the mutiny, but it’s compact and clearly filtered through Vex’s awareness. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, and Thorne’s speech differs just enough in tone to register as a separate presence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice through Maya is consistent and suited to the blend of technical detail and moral calculus. Prose occasionally slips into aphoristic generalization (“Death couldn’t be conned”) that feels slightly more authorial than character-bound, but it aligns reasonably with her reflective temperament. Dialogue is clear and goal-driven, though some of Maya’s explanatory blocks read more like composed monologue than spontaneous speech under stress. Overall, the narrative texture is distinct, controlled, and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature tuned to craft, time, and pattern (“a manuscript written in living wood”).

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly keyed to Mari’s sensibility, with a distinct attentional bias toward textures, documents, and echoes. Syntax and diction are controlled and varied, supporting the contemplative but quietly tense mood. The occasional quasi-philosophical line (“administrative ghosts, filing errors, the officially erased who could perceive reality's thin spots”) still feels rooted in Mari’s worldview rather than authorial intrusion. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from observational to more charged at the spring tide reads intentional and smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice on Marina is steady and confident, with a strong sensory palette and controlled lyrical touches. Claudia’s dialogue has a distinct cadence—self-aware, wry, and slightly performative—so the characters’ voices do not blur. Expository lines are mostly carried via Claudia’s speech, which fits her role as inheritor/interpreter rather than feeling like authorial intrusion. Rhythm and diction are consistent and suited to a literate, reflective protagonist in a quietly uncanny situation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and confident, with a perceptual signature attuned to infrastructure, coded language, and cultural texture that suits Maya’s role. Diction and rhythm are well controlled and modulate with scene intensity, achieving a lyrical but readable flow without head-hopping. The absence of dialogue keeps us slightly distant from other characters and their voices, tilting the piece toward narratorial summary at key beats. A sharper, more idiosyncratic edge to Maya’s internal phrasing could further distinguish this voice at the highest levels.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled, lyrical diction that fits a solitary, scientifically literate inspector. Technical references (Hasselblad, silver nitrate, regolith) are folded into a reflective, almost elegiac narrative texture without breaking distance. Rhythm varies well between long, meditative sentences and tighter clauses around key actions, supporting the accumulative drive. The narration occasionally feels more omnisciently essayistic than strictly character-bound, but the stance is consistent enough not to jar.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and well-matched to Maya’s sensory focus, with a good balance of external action and internal framing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)

Phrasing like “following the mathematics of impossibility” and “unsnarl from her physical form” creates a distinct perceptual signature that matches the character and premise. The narrative distance tightens appropriately around key decisions without confusing the timeline or leaking into authorial commentary. Occasionally the register leans a little abstract, but it remains coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice balances mythic distance with concrete detail; phrases like “sustained by the impossibility of his existence” have a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility. Limited omniscience via the lattice visions is motivated and contained, functioning as a device rather than sloppy head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with lyricism tightening around key images (hovering, copper light, lattice) and easing for exposition. Overall, the voice feels coherent and confident for this dark fable mode.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct, slightly gothic-lyrical texture that fits Marlow’s world and mindset. Dialogue is clean, purposeful, and carries subtext (her “lovingly venomous” lines, his understated responses). Narrative distance stays controlled, slipping closer at key beats (his hand on the bead, his gasp at the memory-flood). A few elevated phrases flirt with being more authorial than character-filtered, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)

Occasional explanatory phrasing slightly undercuts the otherwise immersive lyricism but not enough to materially harm POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly Miriam’s: the way she notices interruptions, bones, and roots reflects her history and doubt. Yakov’s few lines of dialogue have a distinct, gentle assurance that contrasts with her uncertainty. The narrative rhythm modulates well, lingering on charged images (the sundial, the orchard-bones) and tightening around key turns without clunky exposition. There are no POV slips or register jolts; the voice feels publication-ready at many venues.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, confident, and lyrically precise, with a clear perceptual signature in how it lingers on obsolete tech and tactile ritual. Syntax and diction are controlled and consistent with the quasi-literary, slightly elevated narrative stance; there’s no head-hopping or register break. Rhythms vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical. The voice could arguably risk a few sharper modulations under emotional pressure, but for this quiet mode it’s very effective.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is confident, with clean access to Vera’s perceptions and a controlled, slightly wry narrative texture that matches her cunning. Diction and rhythm are generally well modulated: lyrical where appropriate (“galaxy chart embroidered in silver thread on midnight velvet”) but not so ornate as to blur action. Dialogue distinguishes status and attitude—Hecht’s disdain, Crane’s suspicion, Vera’s sing-song evasions—and usually carries subtext. A few phrasings edge toward high fantasy-poetic, but they remain within a coherent register.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinctive blend of spiritual and bodily imagery (“roots twisted like frozen screams,” “moonlight pooled like mercury”). POV access is steady and plausible—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience—and psychic distance stays intimate enough to feel her regret without drifting into essay-like exposition. Rhythm varies and supports mood shifts from eerie to tender, especially around the condensation-windows sequence. A few phrases are somewhat lofty or abstract, but they remain within the established register and don’t break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third on Maya is stable and persuasive, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that plausibly matches her education and experience. Sentence rhythms vary nicely, and the morphine haze is conveyed through gently softened perception rather than clumsy filter stacks.

Dialogue is crisp and functional, with Serena’s lines carrying a distinct roguish, lightly ironic cadence. Occasional slightly more omniscient or aphoristic intrusions (“This was how their converging chaos always began”) are controlled and consistent with the piece’s tonal ambitions. A bit more rhythmic variation at the most intense moments could deepen the sense of squeeze, but nothing here undermines POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in metaphor and pattern-recognition (spirals, photosynthesis, music as matter). Diction and syntax are well controlled; the prose modulates between expansive summary and precise image without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative stance fits the timeless, mythic register of the piece. At times the register skews slightly toward overtly statement-driven wisdom, which flattens the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)

Still, rhythm and syntax are varied and confident, supporting the mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s sensibility: technical metaphors blend naturally with emotional inference (“water, like truth, always finds its level”). Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush lines offset by precise, grounded clauses about mechanisms and measurements. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the diction feels like a thoughtful, technically literate person’s interior narration.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Margot’s sensibilities (her professional lens on pigeons and trajectories suffuses how she sees dust, letters, and music).

When Theodore speaks, his dialogue is restrained and purposeful, matching his role and history. The voice stays emotionally intimate without tipping into therapy-speak or authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is a confident, lyrical close third, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in geometry, weather, and tactile measurement (“featherly determined,” “corn whispered in fractured hush”). Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mystical, scientifically-minded worldview inherited from her father; there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. Rhythm varies nicely between long, meditative sentences and tighter, action-focused ones during the descent and center discovery. The only modest limit is a slight uniformity of register—emotional peaks are voiced in the same high lyric mode as setup, rather than modulating more sharply under stress.

Phrasing like “the cosmos speaks through flesh” and “pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin” provides a distinct perceptual signature. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)

Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a measured, contemplative cadence that fits the reflective mode and modulates slightly as dawn arrives and the atrium “awakens.” There’s no head-hopping, and the few explanatory moves stay within what Marcus would plausibly infer. At times the voice edges toward essayistic exposition, but it remains anchored enough in his perceptions to feel character-specific rather than generic omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a lyrical yet controlled rhythm that mostly feels plausible for a seasoned, reflective firefighter. Phrases like “violent tenderness” and “ancient choreography” lean literary but remain anchored in Marcus’s contemplative mood. POV boundaries are clean, and free-indirect access is handled smoothly.

Psychic distance is modulated effectively to interleave interior stakes with the external negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confidently controlled, with a distinct texture that combines clinical technicality (“atmospheric manipulation satellites,” “industrial salt pellets”) and elegiac lyricism (“archive of absences,” “songs in a language only the dead could read”). The narrative distance stays consistent and appropriate, giving us Vera’s perceptions without omniscient leakage. Diction matches her intellect and world, and the rhythm of the prose modulates well between exposition and charged image. The only ceiling on a higher score is that the voice, while excellent, doesn’t quite push into a truly idiosyncratic or risky register under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a clear conceptual bias toward metaphors of memory, music, and cellular change that feel specific to this world. Psychic distance is managed well; we stay primarily inside Marcus’ interpretive frame even when describing the Magistrate’s internal experience via the cellular memory device. Occasional omniscient certainties (e.g., “his son's fever would break within the hour”) are justified by the story’s metaphysics and do not fracture POV. The rhythmic control is good, if slightly uniform in its elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism grounded in material detail—fog as “a living thing,” mirrors that “remember intentions,” glass that “sang with possibility.” POV remains steady through Elara’s sensibility, with her practical craft language tempering the more mystical imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, mildly lyrical texture (“deciduous vows—like autumn leaves,” “roots threading through stonework like determined fingers”) that feels unified with Elara’s sensibility. Dialogue is clean and character-distinguishing: Mira’s lines are brisk and youthful, Elara’s more measured, and both advance pressure and relationship. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the light omniscient touches never undercut focalization. A few aphoristic lines edge toward authorial commentary, but they don’t materially disrupt POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lucid, and lyrically inclined without drifting into omniscient explanation outside what this particular curator could plausibly frame. Diction and rhythm suit a thoughtful, scientifically trained mind encountering metaphysical phenomena, and brief dialogue reads natural and purposeful. The tonal modulation from bewilderment to “terrible joy” is controlled and consistent. There’s room for an even sharper, more idiosyncratic verbal signature, but the current voice would be publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with controlled mythic overtones, and the perceptual filter is consistent with an erudite, language-focused protagonist. Diction and syntax are stable, with rhythm that suits the contemplative, fantastical tone without tipping into self-parody. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the mountain’s single line carrying weight.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon around harmonics, silence, and light/dark inversions that feels suited to Mira’s long custodial vigil. POV stays stable and modest; we don’t get information she couldn’t plausibly intuit. A few lines tilt toward authorial essay (“Every coincidence… had been gravity”) but generally remain grounded in her conceptual frame. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive reverie and higher-pressure action at the beacon’s peak.

Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven (the mosaic artist’s skepticism/hope, the fire spinner’s plea). Psychic distance is managed cleanly, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice through Mira is consistent, with a distinctive observational lexicon that fits a tidal-pool chronicler: “microscopic symphonies,” “calcium cities,” “sideways” emergences. Dialogue is natural, restrained, and carries subtext about shared history and fear without over-explaining. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the lyricism remains controlled enough not to blur clarity. The voice doesn’t take extreme risks, but it feels confident and particular rather than generic.

    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture (e.g., “honey-copper sweetness,” “frost made of whispers”) that feels attuned to Mira’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well managed: we stay inside her perceptions while maintaining enough altitude for the conceptual framing. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and rhythmic variation generally supports the scene’s shifts from anticipation to wonder to quiet resolve. Occasionally, the narration leans a touch general (“what breathing meant,” “rang with possibilities”), but not enough to blur the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice anchored in Marcus is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound and atmospheric nuance. Prose rhythm varies well, and the narration slides between observation and gentle lyricism without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially in the “Too loud” exchange that crystallizes the paradox of silence. Occasionally the narrative idiom lapses into editorial abstraction (“architecture of silence,” “role... transformation”), but not enough to break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent blend of technical and lyrical diction that suits a lore keeper in a high-tech orchard of memory. Phrasing like “wisely adventurous steps” and “song of democracy reborn in exile” gestures toward a slightly elevated register that generally fits the reflective tone. There are minor moments of abstraction where narration summarizes theme rather than staying tightly in Anya’s sensorium, but not enough to break POV integrity. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the keeper’s sensibility, with recurring metaphors (suffocation, scars, thresholds) forming a coherent perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are elevated but not implausible for a mythic/parable frame, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent lexicon (“sepia reading room,” “standing waves of perception,” “eloquently silent”) that suits both character and premise. POV boundaries are clean; all knowledge remains plausibly inside Victoria’s perception or logical extrapolation from the waves. Rhythm modulates well between longer, musing sentences and sharper beats around the needle lift and window shattering. The voice is distinctive and polished, if not so idiosyncratic that it feels utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—phrases like “living equations, solving themselves endlessly” and “illumination of unmade things” feel unified rather than generic fantasy prose. Psychic distance stays stable, aligned with Aldric’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the elevated diction matches both subject matter and his cultivated, alchemical awareness. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the language from becoming sing-song despite its density. A bit more modulation—brief plainer beats under peak stress—could heighten contrast, but control is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature that marries Marcus’s archivist sensibility to the language (“reading the accumulation like braille,” “language of accumulated silence”). Diction and rhythm fit a reflective, intelligent but not implausibly erudite narrator, and the free indirect style is clean. The modulation from observational to quietly charged toward the end feels controlled rather than overwrought. Occasional thesis-like lines slightly flatten the otherwise excellent voice but do not materially harm POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV on Mira is steady and controlled, with a confident narrative stance that fits her reflective, mildly poetic sensibility. Diction is generally consistent with the world and character, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and sensibly anchored in Marcus’s perceptions and professional idiom as a musician. The narrative rhythm—longer, image-rich sentences modulating around key beats—suits the accumulative, atmospheric drive. Diction and metaphors are generally consistent with the mystical-jazz register and do not break POV plausibility. Limited dialogue is functional and in-character, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and sonically distinct, with a controlled mythic register that suits the premise and feels plausibly close to Mira’s perception. Imagery choices (e.g., “gravity’s rebellious children”) reveal a consistent vertical lexicon and conceptual obsession. Psychic distance is handled well: we remain intimate with Mira’s sensory and interpretive experience without unnecessary authorial explanation. At times the elevated diction risks slight over-sameness in tone, but it never slips into jarring register or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically textured without sacrificing clarity, with a distinct sensibility in lines like “pointing nowhere and everywhere at once” and “keeping perfect time in its own lost way.” The narrative distance is well controlled, sliding smoothly between concrete action and reflective summary while staying close to Marcus’s perspective. Quotations are minimal but clean, and the diction is consistent with a quiet, meticulous tinkerer in a quasi-fantastical setting. A bit of tonal and rhythmic variation at peak beats could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice through Vera is steady, lyrical, and confident, with controlled shifts in intensity that suit the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a clear perceptual anchor in Mara and only light, controlled omniscience. Phrasing such as “weeping made of music” and “light too new for shadows” gives the piece a distinct texture without tipping into incoherence. Dialogue is sparse but functional and differentiated, with Thomas’s speech carrying his self-consciousness and Mara’s lines practical and gently provocative. The voice does not radically modulate under peak pressure, which keeps it beautiful but slightly uniform in emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice filtered through an analytically enhanced body is distinct: precise grams, degrees, and spectral frequencies feel character-specific and consistent. Diction and rhythm balance lyricism with clarity, and the scientific-mathematical register fits Lyra’s subjectivity. Occasional lines risk sounding like authorial thesis (“This was her penance, then—not punishment but transformation”), but the POV remains mostly coherent. Dialogue is minimal yet functional and tonally appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice through Mira is stable and textured, with a clear perceptual signature focused on language gaps, light, and pigment.

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is well controlled. At peaks, the voice edges toward overt statement but does not break its established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)

The narrative voice balances lyricism with clarity, modulating smoothly from eerie atmosphere to investigative focus and back to quiet, weighted reflection. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; exposition about the conspiracy and grandmother’s past remains character-bound. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional where used (“You weren’t selling tickets”), carrying subtext rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctively lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward the tactile and the liminal (“rustling awakenings,” “origami made of time”). Diction and syntax sustain a dreamlike yet controlled tone that fits both Moth’s sensibility and the negotiable-reality premise. The narrative distance stays stable, and shifts into broader, almost mythic framing at the end feel like an intentional widening rather than leakage. There’s minimal exposition scaffolding; most worldbuilding is carried in the same textured voice that governs the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and assured, with a lyrical texture that feels appropriate for a poet-turned-archaeologist. Cassia’s perceptions (timestreams as tactical maps, sorrow as lens) give the narration a distinct signature. Dialogue is clean and functional, with a clear rhythm difference between her quiet intensity and Huang’s procedural anxiety. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and shifts in rhythm at emotional peaks read intentional.

    The third-person voice has a clear, fable-like texture that suits the mythic-steampunk premise, with controlled elevated diction and strong rhythmic phrasing. POV is stable and close enough to Elias to keep the experience grounded while allowing some world-level commentary. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Vex’s brief appearance reads as distinct without over-explaining. A few aphoristic lines at the end feel more authorial than character-bound, but they don’t seriously disrupt the established stance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly Vera-filtered, with sensory-rich diction that suits a collector attuned to scent and memory. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with longer sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter lines at turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, confident, and consistently filtered through Amara’s archivist sensibility, with a good balance of lyricism and clarity. Temporal slippage between present and past is handled cleanly and feels intentional, not like head-hopping. Dialogue is economical and purposeful, especially Marcus’s lines about knowing vs. understanding. At peak thematic moments the register drifts a bit toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with controlled, often lyrical sentences and a confident, slightly elevated diction befitting an exiled alchemist. Filter and summary are used judiciously; the piece maintains clarity without over-explaining. There’s a distinct perceptual texture in how he thinks about memory and possibility, but the voice doesn’t yet feel singular enough to be unmistakable. Slightly sharper idiosyncrasy in phrasing or image choice could move this toward an elite-register voice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinct: Matthias’s pattern-centric, historically saturated perception shapes diction and metaphor throughout. Syntax and rhythm vary in step with pressure, with longer, reflective sentences in memory and conceptual exposition and tighter beats around the shaving’s revelation and the tower’s crack. Lyric turns (“sound was just patterns, that voices were mathematics carved in wax”) feel consonant with his mind rather than authorial intrusion. Point of view remains stable and modest in its claims, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a distinct lyric texture (“furiously tranquil precision,” “chrysalis of a moment,” “oak that learned to remember the future”) that feels matched to Mira’s temporal, botanical vocation. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative perspective doesn’t leak or wobble. At times the register drifts toward abstract essayistic phrasing, which slightly flattens immediacy under peak pressure. Still, the perceptual signature—what she notices, how she metaphors time and seeds—is consistent and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and mildly lyrical, with good control of distance and a consistent perceptual bias rooted in Mara’s profession. Technical terms (microclimate, barometric data) sit comfortably alongside more poetic phrasing (mountain drawing breath, storms that whisper), creating a distinct texture. There’s occasional drift toward generic phrasing or editorial summary, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the narrative stance suits the story’s aims and modulates appropriately as pressure increases.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct contemplative texture that feels appropriate for an ancient, quasi-mystical AI janitor. Diction like “pilgrims completing their journeys” and “flourishing stillness” creates a clear perceptual signature. POV and tense are stable and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with memorable turns like “the rough sandpaper of anxiety, the silk of contentment, the sticky tar of grief.” POV is steady third-person close to Marcus, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience beyond the metaphysical frame the story establishes. Diction and rhythm suit the speculative-literary mode and modulate well between description and conceptual exposition. It’s distinctive without becoming mannered, though not quite at the virtuoso level that would push into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice through Mira is consistent, lyrical, and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices pattern, light, and “liminal spaces.” Sentence rhythm is well modulated, stretching for contemplative observation and tightening around the kite snap without feeling mechanical. Dialogue is brief but natural, and the narration mostly avoids over-knowing omniscience. A few lines drift toward generalized authorial musing, but overall POV control and voice are strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lyrical-scientific texture (“architectural frequencies only the dying could perceive,” “geological memories of previous extinctions”). POV boundaries are clean, and the narrative distance holds steady, allowing both mythic register and concrete technical detail. Occasionally the register tilts toward expository abstraction, but it largely serves the character and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a cool, precise, slightly lyrical register befitting a rational but unsettled scientist. Scientific diction and metaphor (“spectral analysis,” “neurochemical triggers,” “planet-wide neural network”) feel natural for Elena and integrate smoothly with more poetic touches like “bronze quiet” and “ancient chemistry of seekers.” Dialogue is spare but functional, concise, and carries subtext about past rivalry and shared disillusionment. At times the narrative steps into a slightly omniscient, thesis-like mode that sounds more like the author than Elena, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is assured, with a distinct, slightly archaic lyricism that matches the subject matter and never slips out of register. The perceptual signature—equating birdsong with language, seeing nutrients and bones under every image—is consistent and character-rooted. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, building a meditative cadence that suits an accumulative drive. A shade more modulation between contemplative and sharp, grounded observation might heighten contrast, but as is it’s strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct sensory bias (smell, texture, mechanical detail) that suits a retired bloodhound in a scrapyard. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly stay within a plausible narrative register for this semi-fabulist world, and the “color-tinted revelations” device feels tonally of a piece with the rest. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Kemp’s one line effectively sets tone and stakes. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance is modulated cleanly at key beats without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and well matched to lyrical SF, with controlled shifts between present perception and memory anchored in concrete cues (the compass, rice paper, grandmother’s sketches). Diction and rhythm are distinctive without becoming mannered, and technical terms like “dilation fields” and “experimental drives” feel natural inside the idiom. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative’s knowledge stays plausibly within Kira’s experience. Occasionally, the narration edges toward essayistic abstraction in thematic lines, which slightly thins the otherwise strong character-driven texture.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a clear perceptual signature in how Renn notices impossible geometries, trapped starlight, and emanations from the chess pieces. Diction is consistently mythic but controlled, and the Keeper’s dialogue has a distinct, cold clarity that contrasts with Renn’s more tactile, playful focus. POV remains stable and modest, never claiming knowledge beyond Renn’s grasp. Rhythm modulates well between lush description and tighter, action-focused sentences during the test.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture (“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless with truth”) that feels coherent with Marina’s sensibility. POV is stable and confident, with no leakage or unmotivated shifts in distance. Diction occasionally edges into essayistic abstraction, but the pattern is taught early and remains consistent rather than jarring. Sparse dialogue is natural enough and serves as action and pressure rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a distinctive tactile and sensory bias that matches a blind seer steeped in books and mercury. Diction is lyrical but not incoherent; the rhythm modulates well between reflective passages and forward movement. The narrative never overreaches what this character could plausibly perceive, and psychic distance is steady. There’s no dialogue to test, but internal language and imagery feel unified and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and clearly filtered through Kaspar’s analytic, chess-structured mind, with recurring diction around strategy, sacrifice, and correction. Rhythm and syntax are generally well-controlled, modulating between lush description and tighter beats when he begins pulling threads. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the mildly elevated register feels appropriate to a reflective, disgraced tutor rather than an imposed authorial gloss. Some lines veer toward generalized lyricism rather than character-specific phrasing, which keeps this from feeling wholly singular at the very top level.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled metaphors (“towers of bone rose…like accusations,” “forged hush”) and a stable, slightly elevated register that suits a mythic-fable mode. Focalization remains cleanly with Kira; there’s no head-hopping, and narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the shifts in cadence around key lines (“Words are prisms”) are effective. At times the diction edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close-third voice is stable, confident, and textured with a lyrical yet character-appropriate lexicon (an alchemist thinking in terms of transmutation, kintsugi, and quilting memories). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer, image-rich sentences in reflective beats and punchier cuts as supports fail—without losing clarity. Dialogue is minimal but effective, and the statue’s plural voice briefly expands scope without disrupting focalization. It’s very strong, though not at the absolute top band because a few lines tilt toward authorial aphorism rather than staying fully grounded in Mira’s sensory/perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits Marina’s contemplative, solitary nature.

POV control is clean; there’s no head-hopping, and interior access remains plausibly bound to Marina’s awareness. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony and modulates appropriately between harbor routine and cave revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with distinctive turns of phrase (“bruise healing into gold,” “screaming tenderness”) that feel of a piece with Mara’s heightened emotional state. POV is stable and interior access consistent; the narrative doesn’t leak into authorial summary beyond what suits a slightly elevated literary register. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying emotional charge and moving the scene forward rather than explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly filtered through Marina’s professional and emotional lens. Dialogue sounds natural and differentiated (the child, Diego, and faceless callers), and it consistently doubles as action, advancing stakes and revealing character. Diction balances lyricism (“geography of loss”) with concrete machinery and toxins, without sliding into academic or therapy-speak. There are minor moments where narrative phrasing edges toward generality, but they don’t disturb the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly aligned with Mara’s perceptions, with a consistent, slightly lyrical narrative voice. Diction and rhythm are controlled and well-modulated, shifting into sharper, shorter beats around the cure ingestion and the moment she tests whether she can lie. The occasional quasi-academic phrase (“conceptual repricing” is not present; most neuroscience references feel plausible in her voice as a research-driven survivor) doesn’t disrupt coherence. There is minimal dialogue, but her spoken confessions to the empty ravine support character and tone rather than feeling expository.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a controlled lyricism that matches Magnus’s introspective, slightly archaic sensibility. Phrases like “like trying on wet clothes” and “dates and times, arranged like sheet music” show a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative stance rarely overreaches what Magnus can infer, and the modest explanatory moments feel plausibly like his own categorizations. A few expository sentences smooth over emotional complexity but do not break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, slightly antique lyricism that fits an aging map dealer contemplating possibility. Phrasing like “air tasted of minerals and promises” and “topology—the shape of choices not yet made” feels stylistically unified rather than ornamental. Psychic distance shifts smoothly between observation and interior understanding without head-hopping or register breaks. The voice could risk a touch more idiosyncrasy tied to Marcus’s profession to become truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically controlled and cohesive, with a distinct texture (e.g., “the lacy menace in its tone”) that suits the dark fairytale mode. POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping, and the limited dialogue feels natural and purposeful, advancing stakes rather than explaining. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony despite consistently elevated diction. A slight tendency toward ornate phrasing is stylistic rather than sloppy and doesn’t impair clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited POV around Lyra is stable and well-controlled, with a lyrical yet precise narrative voice that fits a scientifically-minded character haunted by memory. Marcus’s dialogue is distinct enough—plainspoken, gently probing—to contrast with Lyra’s more abstract interiority. Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately at the revelation beat ("in the exact moment her name left his lips—she understood") without becoming opaque. There are no head-hops or stance shifts that muddy perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with a distinct lexicon (“feral nostalgia,” “never-weres,” “chronologically impossible moment”) that fits Maya’s sensibility and the surreal premise. The narrative stance handles temporal paradox without confusion, and the modulation between wryness and ache is controlled. There’s no dialogue to stress-test, but the interior narration carries subtext and rhythm on its own. This is a strong, magazine-ready voice, even if not quite singular enough for the rarest air.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, textured, and convincingly shaped by Mara’s altered senses; her attention to sound and touch feels like a true perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled without showiness, and the mild lyricism suits both character and subject. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (particularly in the elided “before—” and Mara’s completion of it). There are no noticeable POV leaks or register jolts, and the voice modulates gracefully into the final meditative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly lyrical register that matches the fantasy-exam setting and Kira’s introspective nature. Diction like “saturated hush,” “liquid starlight,” and “between tempests” forms a recognizable texture without tipping into self-parody. POV distance is well-managed; we stay within Kira’s perceptions and knowledge, and Master Yuen’s few lines remain external. A bit of line-level abstraction in the final reflections keeps this from feeling utterly singular, but the voice is still strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third on Vera is stable and confident, with a voice that plausibly belongs to a sharp, metaphor-prone columnist who has actually seen hauntings. Dialogue is clean, distinct, and goal-driven: Marcus challenges, Vera defends then yields, Elisabetta comments with a different timbre. The prose modulates gracefully between lyric (“memory itself, distilled”) and concrete (“chainsaws warming up,” “parking”), maintaining a coherent persona. A few aphoristic turns (“Apologies are just words floating in air…”) skirt the edge of authorial pronouncement but remain just believable for these characters.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is a controlled, elevated third-person that comfortably handles metaphysical material without collapsing into jargon or awkward registers. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with recurring patterns (“heart-that-was-also-its-edge,” “space between spaces”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. The POV distance stays stable and close enough to Kaia’s perceptions while allowing for cosmic-scale description. A few formulations verge on familiar “cosmic mysticism” cadences, but overall the perceptual signature is distinct and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The limited third-person voice has a clear, controlled lyricism with consistent diction that matches a contemplative, technically competent worker. Technical terms (valves, cistern, escapements) sit comfortably alongside metaphorical language about memory and distance, and the narrative distance stays stable. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and shorter countdown fragments, supporting the accumulative feel. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though a few thematic statements edge toward essayistic rather than purely embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical language with lyric metaphors in a way that suits a scientifically literate but introspective protagonist. Maya’s perceptual biases—toward spatial modeling, barriers, pulses—give the narration a distinct texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural and economically used to mark relational warmth and surprise; Chen’s brief appearance feels lived-in. Minor lapses into generic abstraction aside, the POV control and tonal modulation are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with an intelligent, slightly wry academic diction that suits a probability professor. Metaphors (slot machines in a cardiac wing, lantern interference patterns) feel characteristic rather than generic. Dialogue is clean and purposeful, carrying subtext about shared parental addictions and philosophical stance. Occasionally the narrative voice leans into essay-like abstraction, but it remains anchored enough in Elena’s perception to avoid feeling authorially detached.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and confident, with a distinct lyric register that fits Marcus’s inward, nocturnal job. Dialogue reads natural enough while holding a faintly uncanny timbre that matches the tunnel’s acoustics and the “melodically haunted” idea; Marcus and Eleanor feel differentiated. The narrative diction stays coherent and doesn’t drift into an alien register for the POV. It’s strong, though not so idiosyncratically patterned that it becomes unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent with Mara’s profession and temperament—ink, paper, and scent metaphors feel character-true. Rhythm varies well between lush descriptive sentences and tighter, decision-focused lines, especially around the codicil-writing sequence. Limited dialogue is clean and in-character, and the narration never slips into authorial omniscience beyond what the setup (her research) justifies. A few abstractions at the end (“haunted euphoria,” “perfect records in an imperfect world”) are slightly more essayistic than the rest but remain tonally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and distinct, with sharp phrasings (“professional ghost,” “green cathedral of abandoned intentions”) and a consistent slightly-omniscient close-third around Sadie that occasionally but cleanly comments on Marcus. Dialogue is crisp, character-specific, and advances both plot and theme, with status dynamics legible in the banter over coffee and rumor. The aphoristic turns feel voice-driven rather than generic author intrusion, though a few border on essayistic. Overall, POV control and tonal modulation are strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in non-visual senses and conceptual metaphors of sound and mapping. Diction and rhythm are controlled and largely appropriate to a lyrical, speculative mode, without drifting into academic or clinical register. The narrative stance stays tightly aligned with Elara’s unusual way of apprehending the world. Occasional abstract formulations (“soul’s architecture,” “emotional cartography”) are on-theme but could risk sameness if pushed further.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, science-poetic lexicon that suits Mira’s role and worldview. Explanatory passages about the anomaly’s mechanics and contingent relationships stay within a plausible register for a technical yet reflective protagonist. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance remains stable. Occasionally, exposition edges toward essayistic, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice on Maya is consistent, lyrical, and well modulated, with signed dialogue integrated cleanly and without confusion. Diction and rhythm feel controlled yet flexible, and Chen’s “voice” through signing reads distinct from Maya’s internal lens. The narrative never slips into unearned omniscience or explanatory scaffolding; instead it relies on curated images and gestures. Overall the perceptual signature—obsession with framing, mapping, and negative space—feels character-specific and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, thoughtful texture, with recurring phrases (“volcanic tenderness”) and disciplined diction that suit both Mira’s analytic and artistic sensibilities. POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge. Lyric tendencies generally serve mood rather than obscuring meaning. Occasionally the register slides into essayistic abstraction, but not enough to break the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and assured, with a clear lyric texture that matches the speculative premise. Diction (“auric lagoon,” “acoustic flowers,” “collective unconscious”) is elevated but coherent with Mira’s altered, near-death perspective and the genre frame. Dialogue is sparse yet functional and in character, particularly Chen’s clinical avoidance of eye contact versus Mira’s defiant line across realities. Occasionally the narrative voice edges toward authorial thesis rather than Mira-filtered perception, but not enough to break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and colored by Marcus’s occupational mindset; the way he perceives sound, gait, and layout feels distinct and grounded. Prose and dialogue sit comfortably in the same register, and Chen’s few spoken lines read natural and situation-appropriate. While the voice is competent and occasionally lyrical, it isn’t uniquely idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring enough to be unforgettable. Still, control of distance and access is solid, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward light, water, and movement that suits Mira as focal presence. Phrases like “spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse” show a distinct texture and rhythm. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narration doesn’t overreach into omniscient explanation of unearned interior states. At times the diction leans a bit writerly and explanatory in the thematic sentences, but overall the voice is controlled and fitting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice centered on Marcus is steady, with a light omniscient shimmer via the sentient library that feels intentional rather than sloppy head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled and suitably elevated for the quasi-mythic tone, and dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying emotional and thematic weight without stiffness. The “amplified quiet” narrative stance is consistent, modulating gently as pressure builds. There’s little in the way of risk-taking in POV, but control is high and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a persuasive blend of physical observation and interiority filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Phrasing like “moved like water itself” and “combative tenderness” gives the prose a distinct texture without overreaching. Occasional omniscient or essayistic intrusions (“This was how the world had changed”) slightly widen the distance from Mira and feel more explanatory than necessary. Dialogue is clean and carries subtext, especially in Torven’s shift from possessive to pleading.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is precise, controlled, and consistent, with a cool observational distance that fits a world of policed affect. The performer’s flat, ritualistic speech contrasts nicely with the more shaded third-person rendering of Mrs. Chen’s perceptions, yet both feel of a piece stylistically. Rhythm and diction are varied enough to keep the lyric mode from becoming monotonous. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the slight omniscient tilt in phrases like “the performer’s moral ambiguity lived in this space” feels deliberate and coherent with the story’s essayistic undertone.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm that suits a poet-protagonist (e.g., “lantern-moth hush,” “living calligraphy”). POV control is steady; we stay within Silas’s perceptions without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times, the voice drifts toward abstract essayistic commentary, especially around the Order’s fears and the moral of boundary-crossing, which slightly dilutes immediacy. Overall, though, the perceptual signature is strong and textured enough for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited POV through Mira is stable and well handled, with her sensory bias (grays, texture) giving the narration a distinct feel. Dialogue is natural, lightly subtextual (especially around Enzo’s denial about the reed and his daughter), and advances both plot and relationship. The narrative voice modulates well between concrete description and quiet lyricism without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the reflective passages are anchored cleanly in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that feels aligned with Vera’s reflective disposition. Diction and rhythm are varied, and the prose modulates gently as the music and crowd build, without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping, and the narrator never claims knowledge beyond Vera’s plausible inferences. Occasionally the voice edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break the POV frame.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistently close to Elena, with sensory detail and metaphor choices that feel plausibly hers and align with her craft and grief (wire coiling, fire, ash, starlight). Prose modulates well between slightly elevated lyricism in description and simpler, natural dialogue; the widow’s brief speech feels understated and human rather than expository. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable. A few abstract formulations at the end slightly flatten what is otherwise a distinctive, textural voice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice around Vera is consistent, with a nice blend of technical and occult diction that suits the concept. Marcus’s dialogue is serviceable if somewhat neutral, functioning mainly to cue exposition rather than revealing much distinct personality. Narrative rhythm and sentence-level control are steady, though the voice rarely takes a risk that surprises at the level of syntax or idiom. The POV is clean and legible throughout, supporting the concept well.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Mira’s training and sensory overload. Syntax and rhythm flex well between hushed awe, horror, and the convulsive climax, and the diction fits the speculative, quasi-mystical register. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; the narrative distance stays tight enough to feel immediate yet broad enough for the conceptual frame. Occasional abstract phrases in the ending nudge toward essayistic, but they do not materially disrupt the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Mira’s reflective, meticulous temperament. Diction and syntax show a distinct texture (“blooming library,” “softly deliberate progression”) without tipping into incoherence. Psychic distance is managed well, sliding between external description and interior realization without leaks into authorial omniscience. The lyric register stays plausible for the character’s intellectual and emotional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady and well-controlled, with a lyrical but not overwrought texture that fits an educated, reflective wildlife professional. Diction like “chromatic dance,” “illegal augmentation,” and “layers of deception” feels plausible for her register and doesn’t tip into academic abstraction. Free indirect access to her thoughts is clean, and there’s no POV slippage despite references to absent characters (Dr. Chen, board members). Rhythm modulates effectively between more compressed summary lines and slower, sensory-rich beats around the surgery and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (reading coffee rings, “chlorophyll dreams,” “vegetable grief”). Diction is elevated but coherent with Maya’s introspective, quasi-mystical mindset, and the narrative distance remains steady. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from groggy anesthesia to sharp clarity is handled cleanly. A few formulations edge toward self-conscious poeticism, but they don’t fracture POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits a character whose work is inherently metaphorical. Diction and syntax have a distinct texture (“hummed with dust motes and memory,” “spatial imagination of one crystal gazer’s mind”) without slipping into syntactic monotony. At times the narration feels a touch more essayistic than character-bound, but the slippage is minor and does not confuse POV. The rhythm modulates appropriately as the psychometric flood intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to a character attuned to cosmic phenomena, with diction that feels plausibly heightened for a “moonstruck dreamer.” Rhythms vary nicely, and the narrative maintains a stable psychic distance while dipping into her perceptions and realizations without head-hopping. The prose sometimes leans into abstraction, but it rarely obscures clarity or breaks the perceptual signature. There is room to sharpen idiosyncrasy—make Lyra’s mental idiom even more her own rather than generally poetic—but at this level the voice is solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Kess’s sensibility and the world’s altered physics. Diction choices like “probability fog,” “markets of never-was,” and “glass breaking in reverse” feel tonally unified and character-appropriate for this mythic, post-physics milieu. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the pirate’s lines carrying subtext about value and violation, and Kess’s speech reflecting her temporal/grammatical dislocation. The prose’s lyricism is controlled enough that it rarely muddies POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lucidly lyrical texture that matches the philosophic, speculative mode. Diction (“probability streams,” “mechanical consciousness,” “Great Dampening”) feels of a piece with this world and mind, with good modulation from descriptive to more charged moments at the Loom Tree. There is no POV slippage, and the narrative stance remains confidently tethered to the philosopher’s perceptions and lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct textural signature (sea/shore metaphors, ritual diction) that remains controlled and coherent. The POV distance—essentially close third with mythic overtones—is stable, and the ferry guides’ speech rhythms contrast nicely with Marina’s more straightforward confession. Syntax and rhythm vary in a way that matches the scene’s calm, dreamlike pressure and give the piece a polished literary feel. There’s no head-hopping or register clash that disrupts the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice stays tightly aligned with Marcus, with consistent diction, calm lyricism, and a perceptual signature that lingers on tactile cold and sound. Expository passages about the incident and the choir are smoothly woven into his perspective and do not read as omniscient dumps. Dialogue is minimal but distinct—Elena’s sparse, fragile whisper contrasts with Marcus’s simple, action-focused lines. At times, the narrator drifts toward a more essayistic register (“agreement between sound and silence”) that feels slightly more abstract than Marcus’s lived sensorium, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-suited to a mythic-fantasy register, with phrases like “truth crystallized into material form” giving it a distinct texture without tipping into purple. Psychic distance is steady; we are close enough to Syln to track her perceptions while maintaining a slightly elevated, fable-like narration. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, carrying status dynamics between Syln and the pretender. A touch more idiosyncrasy in diction or imagery tied directly to Syln could push the voice into a more singular, unforgettable register.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and colored by Lena’s scientific background and familial mythos; it balances technical terms (temperature, salinity, pH) with more lyrical phrasing without feeling schizophrenic. The recurring attention to sound/tapping and to visual patterning gives the narration a distinctive perceptual signature. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register lurches, though certain abstract formulations (“periodically eternal,” “what was periodically eternal”) feel a bit like authorial thesis slipping in rather than pure character-thought. Overall the voice feels polished and publication-ready, but could edge further into idiosyncratic specificity to be truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kira’s sensibility, with recurring attention to texture, light, and sound that suits her contemplative, half-mystic stance. Prose registers as elevated but plausibly within the story’s aesthetic frame; there’s no head-hopping or POV leakage. Rhythm modulates well—long descriptive sentences for atmosphere, shorter declaratives around realizations (“The rebellion hadn’t failed; it had simply inhaled”). At times the narration veers toward authorial abstraction (e.g., “exhaustion dressed as peace”), but it largely remains in tune with the character and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice stays tightly tethered to Chen’s perceptions while allowing hints of a wider world, and the diction feels suited to a serious, literate SF piece. Sentences have varied rhythm, and the plant-communication is handled with elegant metaphorical language that remains legible. Dialogue is sparse but functional, if somewhat straightforward; it serves plot more than subtext, so emotional nuance in speech could be richer.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical but controlled texture, with observations and metaphors that clearly belong to Amira’s sensibility and history. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, becoming more clinical when invoking Dr. Mansour and more expansive around plants and landscape. POV boundaries hold cleanly; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Occasional expository sentences about her nervous system recalibrating are still aligned with her therapeutic framework and don’t fracture the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends painterly attention, occult imagery, and emotional fracture. Rhetorical questions, metaphoric turns, and syntactic rhythm all feel rooted in Marina’s sensibility rather than generic lyricism. POV control is tight—no head-hopping, no unjustified knowledge leaps—and the distance modulation during peak beats (e.g., as she sketches and reinterprets the walls) is smooth. The voice does occasionally veer toward explicit philosophizing, but it remains embedded enough in her crisis that it doesn’t break stance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and at times striking (“ghost of science itself,” “consciously wild methodology”). The perceptual focus—on patterns, tech, and anomalies—fits a dedicated tracker of time phenomena. Yet the diction often drifts into abstract, academic registers and explanatory summary, especially around the thematic statements, which flattens immediacy. The voice is competent and distinctive enough, but not yet sharpened into something singular and inescapably alive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, confident, and tonally consistent, with a cool, slightly elevated register that suits a meticulous archivist in a high-tech vault. The narration balances technical terms (“quantum-locked passages,” “electromagnetic sleep”) with emotionally charged phrasing without breaking POV plausibility. Rhythm and sentence variety support both atmosphere and momentum. The voice is distinctive but not yet unmistakable; it could afford one more idiosyncratic edge tied specifically to Vera’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, gently lyrical texture (“prayer made solid,” “plants leaned toward kindness like sunlight”). Diction fits the quasi-mythic SF/fable register and feels plausible for Mira’s sensibility, while the father’s sparse dialogue effectively differentiates him. Psychic distance is steady; brief reflective moves are anchored in concrete action and do not break POV. A few abstractions (“senseless perception,” “weave continuity through chaos”) flirt with vagueness but don’t materially harm the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward sound and pattern. Diction and syntax feel unified—no register slips into academic or corporate language—and the rhythmic variation suits the accumulative, almost incantatory mode. The narration stays within what Kova can plausibly observe and infer, avoiding unmotivated omniscience. The main limitation is that lyric intensity remains fairly even; a bit more modulation at peak stress might sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is assured, with a consistent, slightly elevated, metaphor-friendly register that matches Margot’s background and intellect. The observational bias—physics, orbits, instruments, newsprint—creates a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm is varied and controlled, and the narrative never slips out of her perspective. No dialogue is needed; the one reported phone call is handled cleanly and economically.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative, solemn material; phrases like “meteor hush” and “between heartbeats” feel like a coherent stylistic signature rather than random ornament. POV control is clean, staying close to Mara while occasionally offering light, permissible exposition. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately, slowing for reflective beats and tightening around key actions. There is a consistent atmospheric hush without drifting into generic “poetic” vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors arise from chalk, sound, and water (“like milk through water,” “map of sound itself”). Psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. The register is elevated but consistent with Seraphina’s imaginative, artistic mind. While the rhythm leans uniformly lush rather than dynamically modulated, it never tips into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical register that fits Sarai’s sensibility and the quasi-mystical setting. Sentence rhythm varies nicely between lush description and sharper declaratives at turns (“The stones remember,” “But mercy isn’t about purity”). Dialogue sounds natural for the world and differentiates Sarai’s terse conviction from the old man’s reactive awe. There are occasional abstractions and coined phrases, but they generally feel voice-appropriate rather than intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in Cornelius’s synesthetic responses (“applause…honey and copper,” voices that “gleamed silver”). Rhythm and diction suit a slightly theatrical, haunted sensibility without sliding into academic register. The narrative stance doesn’t leak into other interiorities, and the occasional Shakespeare and tarot references feel organic to this character and world. Under emotional pressure, the voice intensifies but doesn’t lose clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice around Maya is confident, with a distinct lexicon blending technical and lyrical registers (“somatic markers… read like sheet music,” “willowglass hope”). Dialogue is generally natural and character-specific: David’s lines are grounded and skeptical, while Maya’s are visionary but not incoherent. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally the abstract/philosophical register edges toward essayistic, but it doesn’t fully break the coherence of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct in its fusion of scientific diction with quietly lyrical phrasing (“consciousness left traces as real as footprints”). The perceptual filter—especially through temperature and heat-signature imagery—feels character-specific and reinforces her augmented sensory world. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shift, and the narrative distance remains stable. At times the voice tends toward generalized exposition, but overall it maintains a clear, engaging texture.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and suited to the contemplative, fable-like material. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled, with some nice turns of phrase and a consistent sensibility anchored in Mara’s quiet attention. At times, the voice slips into generic abstraction (“shared wisdom,” “pure potential,” “raw possibility”) that feels less character-specific and more authorial. Even so, POV control is clean and the narrative texture is distinct enough to feel intentional and publishable with revision.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual filter and confident diction (“silver hush,” “the whole broken machinery of nations and secrets looking small and fixable”). Dialogue reads natural enough for high-level operatives, though key lines are a bit on-the-nose (“The operation didn’t fail. We needed someone completely outside…”). Psychic distance is managed well, and the narrative doesn’t leak into omniscient or explanatory registers beyond what fits Margot’s knowledge. Rhythm is varied and suits the contemplative yet tense scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, gently lyrical, and consistent with Thomas’s calm, craftsmanly perspective, with occasional omniscient tilts that still feel cohesive. Dialogue is natural, slightly formal but fitting the tone, and advances both exposition and emotional stakes. Phrasing like “spindrift serenity” and “palimpsest of promises” gives the narrative a distinct texture without drifting into academic register. It’s a strong, confident voice, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, blending tactile craft vocabulary with quietly lyrical metaphors (“pale green like memory, cracked like the world itself”). Mei’s perception shapes diction—sun, clay, and pattern recur in ways that feel like her mind rather than an abstract narrator. Temporal oddities (“yesterday, or perhaps tomorrow”) are handled smoothly in voice without breaking orientation. There’s minimal exposition and no head-hopping, with narrative distance modulating gently at reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with inventive but controlled diction (“contemporary with extinction itself”). Marcus’s brief dialogue sounds natural and economical, advancing theme without feeling expository-clunky. Occasional zooms to global context (other awakened people) are handled smoothly and feel like extensions of Kira’s awareness rather than head-hopping. Rhythm varies well between lush description and tighter sentences around key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mira’s artistic sensibility, with recurring attention to light, pattern, and texture. Dialogue is poised and slightly heightened but fits the aestheticized, reflective world of the story, and Chen’s lines carry distinct pragmatic weight. Psychic distance remains stable; any minor omniscient-seeming touches feel more like lyrical compression than leakage. Overall the voice feels controlled and particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV around Maya is stable and well-controlled, mixing technical vocabulary with concrete sensory detail in a consistent register. The narrative voice has a mild lyric texture without tipping into opacity or purple prose. Expository patches (e.g., the AI’s origin) are somewhat tell-heavy but still anchored in her interpretive lens. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense/stance remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct geometric/spatial lexicon that matches Marcus’s mindset (“angles that hurt to perceive,” “each note was a coordinate”). Rhythm and diction are generally well-modulated between calmer description and charged interiority. While strong and polished, the voice stops short of having a truly idiosyncratic, unmistakable signature that would push it into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending forensic precision with an artist’s sensibility in a consistent lexicon. Cadence modulates well between concrete action (“Her easel stood where the victims had been found…”) and more reflective sentences without collapsing into abstraction. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; even the more conceptual lines are plausibly Sarah’s mental frame. A few phrases edge toward essayistic (“architecture of a shattered mind”), but they don’t break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a nice blend of technical diction (“bathymetric reading,” “barometric sensors”) and haunted, sensory language (“reeked of brine and decay,” “spongey dread”). Elara’s perceptual habits—seeing the world through maps, readings, and coded stanzas—give the prose a coherent signature. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, clearly differentiating Hayward’s anxious, procedural focus from her more obsessive drive. A few phrases (“nervously confident energy”) lean generic, preventing this from feeling utterly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyric, and clearly filtered through Marla’s sensibility, with recurring musical and visual metaphors that feel like her way of thinking. Phrases such as “sculpting possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” occasionally drift toward abstract aphorism, but overall the diction stays cohesive. The brief dialogue from the hitchhiker is consistent with his role as a liminal guide and doesn’t break POV bounds. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece from feeling monotonous while supporting its contemplative, luminous mood.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—“dusky harmony,” “performances never truly ended”—that suits a story about pattern and inheritance. POV stays stably centered on Marcus’s perception, with only light, plausible access to Chen’s understanding at the key moment. Rhythms vary, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels aligned with the narrative stance rather than like unmotivated register drift. The main limitation is a slight slide into authorial essay-voice in the closing reflections, which momentarily flattens Marcus’s particular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice around Mira is steady and coherent, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits the material without slipping into opacity. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, distinguishing Hayashi’s practical skepticism from Mira’s more numinous phrasing. The narrative occasionally broadens into a slightly more omniscient, authorial tone (“In the midnight solace of infinite space, they had found their purpose”), but these shifts remain consistent with the established lyric mode. Overall, the perceptual signature—scientific yet dream-attuned—is distinct and well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, elevated, and suitably lyrical for mythic fantasy, with controlled syntax and a clear perceptual bias toward the natural and the arcane.

Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose alive, and the register mostly stays within what this educated, self-scrutinizing man would plausibly think.

The narration occasionally zooms out for brief historical context (the Great Silence) but without breaking focalization in a jarring way. Overall, the perceptual signature—attentive, musical, and gently reverent—is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective, highly trained mind like Viktor’s. Chess/magnetic metaphors feel character-anchored, and psychic distance is stable. Dialogue is slightly elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic tone and advances both theme and relationship. At times the narration slides into essayistic proclamation, which flattens the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Mara’s fascination with sound and silence. Diction and syntax feel controlled, with rhythmic variation and a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., cataloging different “quiet” types). There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately around key moments like the clasp singing and the fireworks pause. A few phrases are somewhat conventional for literary fiction, but overall the voice is assured and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a gentle, lyrical texture that matches both setting and theme and a clear olfactory bias in perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled and occasionally striking without lapsing into obscurity. There are no POV slips or stance mismatches, and the few lines of dialogue sound natural within this mythic-quiet register. The voice is strong and pleasant, if not yet utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly lyrical register that suits the strange-physics world (“whirling silence,” “water that defied reason”). Kessa’s professional lens shows in how she reads currents and treats the environment as navigational data, giving the narration some personality. The voice, however, is not especially idiosyncratic; another pilot could plausibly sound similar, and there’s little modulation in rhythm or diction as pressure rises. Still, POV control is clean, with no leaks or awkward shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, precise, and plausibly professional, with technical terms (anemometer, instrumentation) balanced by atmospheric description. Maya’s perceptual bias—toward wind behavior, procedural steps, and measurement—gives the narration a coherent signature. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the modulation from clinical to faintly awed near the convergence works. What’s missing for higher bands is a more idiosyncratic or surprising rhythmic texture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, with a consistent lyric register and a strong perceptual signature shaped by Lyrian’s synesthesia. Diction and rhythm support the mythic, ceremonial tone while remaining coherent and readable. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shift; the narrative stance stays aligned with Lyrian’s sensory priorities. At times the sweeping, elevated register risks uniformity, but it suits the story’s high-concept, sacred mood.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Kessa’s sensibility as a ritual specialist in a numinous landscape. Diction (“avalanchingly quiet,” “braiding,” “choreographer’s baton”) is distinctive without straying into register mismatch, and interiority and narration share a coherent texture. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around key moments (approaching the thin spot, playing the braid-song, accepting the seed of light) without head-hopping or confusing shifts. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the voice, while elegant, stays safely in one tonal lane and rarely risks surprising rhythmic or idiomatic turns under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism with a clear perceptual signature—Mira’s tendency to perceive everything as equations, printing plates, and overlaid transparencies. Diction and syntax are consistent and modulate well with intensity (e.g., more turbulence when all the borrowed selves press in, more crystalline clarity at the conceptual turn). There is no POV leakage or confusing stance shift. The only thing keeping this from an even higher band is that the elevated register sometimes comes close to uniformity of tone, with limited roughness or modulation to mark truly pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon that blends scientific and mystical registers (“electromagnetic song,” “across the fade from memory to myth”) in a way that feels native to Elara’s world. Psychic distance is well controlled: we move fluidly between external description and her interior stakes without head-hopping or muddle. Occasional omniscient-leaning thematic sentences still feel plausibly like her reflective frame rather than an intrusive narrator. Rhythm and diction are varied enough that the prose has texture without drifting into self-conscious artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, mildly elevated diction that suits a contemplative mystic-scientist (“emotional archaeology,” “language of absorbed experience”) without drifting into incoherent abstraction. Vera’s perceptual signature—seeing emotions as wavelengths, frost as lexicon—feels distinct and stable across the piece. There’s minimal dialogue, but the lone spoken line fits the tone and does its job. A bit of register inflation in some claims of significance edges toward generic “big stakes” language, but overall the POV and voice are confident and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with metaphor (“raveling silence,” “time's unraveling tapestry”) matching the textile premise and Mei’s inherited craft. Psychic distance is steady, staying near Mei’s perceptions even when summarizing family history. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; diction remains unified and apt for a mythic-tinged realist tale. A few declarative thematic lines nudge toward authorial rather than character-filtered voice, but they don’t disrupt overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear perceptual bias toward materials, sound, and impossible physics that suits a contemplative craftsman in a strange world. The narrative distance is consistent; we stay with Korin’s lens without head-hopping, and the prose modulates gracefully between external image and quiet interiority. Diction is elevated but coherent for this fable-like mode. Dialogue is sparse and functional, carrying subtext (the merchant’s tremor, Korin’s warning) without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct sensory texture (“rust became the taste of copper bells, engine grease transformed into violet whispers”) that feels integrated with Kira’s vocation and perception rather than decorative. Psychic distance is well managed, pulling closer in key beats (use of the shard, seeing the mother) without head-hopping or unexplained jumps. Explanatory passages about quantum unraveling and “microscopic tears” flirt with expository flatness but remain within a plausible register for this SF mode and do not break voice coherence. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough for two highly technical, exhausted characters under high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person POV on Elsa is steady and confident, with her perception guiding which maritime and atmospheric details matter. Prose rhythm modulates well between quiet, descriptive passages and the more charged revelation in the lantern room, without head-hopping or stance confusion. Dialogue is spare but functional, distinguishing Jonas’s resigned warmth from Elsa’s tentative speech. The narrative voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture that suits the material.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive blend of technical and mystical diction (“total internal reflection” alongside “tomorrow’s memory”). The narrative maintains an apt psychic distance, hovering just close enough to feel Mira’s role without collapsing into exposition or authorial lecture. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with intensity, especially as the laughter/storm ritual builds and harmonizes with the mirror-twin. No head-hopping or stance slips occur despite the abstract subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture well-matched to the material, with controlled imagery and rhythm (“tethered to reality by chains of woven light,” “valley-mist wonder”). POV is stable and focalization stays closely aligned with Kael’s perceptions and lexicon as a dye master turned story-conduit. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (Chen’s grief and warning) without over-explaining beyond a few thematic statements. The register is consistently elevated yet believable for the quasi-mythic, fantastical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice stays loyal to Marcus’s perception while accommodating a lyrical, reflective register that suits the material. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with a pleasing alternation of long, meditative sentences and shorter, declarative ones at structural turns. The prose shows a coherent perceptual signature—precision about mechanisms, mathematics, and physical space paired with quasi-mystical attention to moonlight and trees. Occasional thematic generalizations push the diction slightly closer to omniscient essay than pure interiority, but not enough to disrupt POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture of metaphor and rhythm that feels consistent with Elara’s perspective. The narrative distance remains steady, and the diction supports the mythic, alchemical tone without sliding into academic or out-of-register language. Variations in sentence rhythm help modulate pressure, especially as the singing builds. With no dialogue to test, POV control and voice cohesion read as confident and publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, precise, and gently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature in how Ezra notices and names paradoxes. Dialogue is slightly heightened but suits a secret society of thinkers, and lines like “Would you like to not be alone?” carry thematic weight without breaking naturalism. Psychic distance is well controlled, deepening at key emotional turns without head-hopping or register slips. The modulation from observational calm to quiet revelation at the end is smooth and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lila’s perceptual bias toward the strange and the botanical. Syntax and diction are controlled, with patterned phrasing that suits the magical-realist tone without slipping into obscurity. Occasional abstract terms (“heuristic kindness,” “displaced sacred”) are at the edge of the register but don’t break the spell. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, and the narrative distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature focused on cold, light, and quiet. Diction and rhythm match Elara’s orderly, contemplative mindset and modulate subtly as tension increases (e.g., the projection of the founder’s slide and the library’s shuddering fall). There is no head-hopping, and the narrative never claims knowledge beyond what this perspective can reasonably infer. The prose texture feels unified and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, sensually precise, and consistent, with rich but controlled metaphors (“recognition blooming like algae in still water,” “wool blanket soaked in seawater”). Dialogue is economical and carries status and subtext, especially in the shifts around “Tommy’s girl” and “truce of hush.” The narrative never leaks beyond Mae’s plausible knowledge, and free-indirect shading into her perceptions feels natural. Rhythm varies well with the beats, supporting both suspense and lyric moments.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical SF texture with consistent diction that fits Marina’s scientific yet wonder-prone perspective. POV is stable, and the narrative comfortably inhabits her perceptions (especially via taste and implant light) without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, if slightly expository in Simon’s key speech. Overall, the voice is controlled and recognizable, though it sometimes prioritizes conceptual flourish over raw, stressed immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that matches Lyra’s artistic sensibility. Metaphors like “the cave opened before her like a geode's heart” and “the museum of her perfect memory” create a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well managed, slipping closer at the creative climax without confusion. There is some risk of tonal sameness in the lyricism, but it never undermines clarity or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, textured, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: Vera sees the world through materials, inscriptions, and sensory impressions tied to her craft. Diction balances lyricism and clarity, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Figural phrases like “smelled of copper and regret” and “breathing leaves and bitter honesty” feel voice-coherent rather than workshop-generic. There is minimal reliance on filter verbs or summary explanation, so the prose maintains immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends Mariel’s sensibility with a slightly elevated narrative stance. Diction and rhythm are well-modulated to suit a quiet, sacred-feeling task; metaphors (bells as “bronze voices,” tower as kinetic sculpture) are coherent and recur meaningfully. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory overreach; the narration maintains a confident distance appropriate to quasi-mythic material. The voice is distinct and memorable without tipping into self-conscious ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice filtered through an android consciousness is controlled and distinctive, balancing technical diction (“optical sensors,” “neural pathways”) with lyrical phrasing. The POV remains stable, and the prose rhythm appropriately slows and intensifies around the ritual without losing clarity. Interiority is conveyed through perception and metaphor rather than overt self-analysis, which suits the character. Occasional abstract thematic sentences slightly flatten the otherwise strong, character-tinted voice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice, largely aligned with Marta, is consistent and controlled, with a calm, observant rhythm suited to her curator sensibility. Dialogue is clean and purposeful, differentiating characters subtly through diction and role (Jorge’s “sandstorm calm,” Mrs. Chen’s practical offers, Elena’s sparse breakthroughs). There is some narratorial omniscience at the edges (“Objects carried their owners’ endings,” “She’d learned that healing begins when someone truly hears”), but it feels like an intentional, lightly lyric stance rather than a leak.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a lucid, lyrical texture that matches Maya’s synesthetic perception of code-as-dance. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, and the narrative maintains stable focalization without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Sentences like “She moved with the patient precision of a spider spinning its web” show a distinct perceptual signature rather than bland reportage. Occasionally the register leans into slightly generic portent (“the familiar weight of destiny”), but this is an infrequent softness rather than a systemic flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and delicately lyrical, with Marina’s observational habits (flames, coffee, physical anomalies) giving her a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well: longer, lush sentences in reflective beats and tighter ones around the grave and coffin. The narrative does not over-explain what Marina already knows, and the withheld backstory about Elena pays off at the vials rather than feeling like cheap suspense. There are no POV slips or register jolts; the diction stays in a believable, slightly heightened literary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture—“moth-thoughts and owl-dreams,” “crystallized moonlight”—that feels consistent with a solitary summoner and her intimate bond with the setting. POV is stable and controlled; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly infer in context. Rhythm and diction adjust subtly with pressure (more active, tactile when she’s catching fragments, more expansive at dawn). The prose feels authored and confident without noticeable stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice feels confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits a philologist attuned to subtleties. Dialogue is natural and subtextual—Marcus’s “transparent excuses,” his grandmother anecdote, and the gentle “interrogation” all carry more than they say. Narrative diction and character speech remain aligned in register, and psychic distance is steady. The perceptual signature—seeing buildings and words as parallel systems—is distinct without being mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Marina’s sensibility, with consistent diction and controlled psychic distance. Phrases like “ghostly resolve” and “incandescent with grief” feel character-coherent rather than imposed, and the speculative terminology (Cognitive Quarantine Program) is cleanly integrated. Rhythm varies well between descriptive and reflective moments. Minor dips into abstract phrasing don’t derail the otherwise confident, unified narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical texture that matches Mei’s sensibility as a calligrapher and forger. Diction and metaphor choices (“calibrated treason,” “pearl twilight,” “aurora’s green dance”) create a distinct tonal signature without obvious register slips. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving smoothly between concrete action and reflective interiority. There’s a slight uniformity in rhythm—many sentences carry similar cadence—but not enough to seriously dull the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and filtered through Senna’s sensory and conceptual biases (sound metaphors, musical framing, attention to echoes). Rhythm varies nicely, with longer cadences for reflection and shorter, punchier lines as the pressure crests around her choice. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic, contemplative frame; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few lines verge on “explanatory narrator” rather than pure focalized perception, which keeps this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a clear lyrical texture (“borrowed starlight,” “windows of connection”) that feels consistent with Marina’s unusual vocation. Expository passages (about the weapon and refugees) remain within a controlled narrative stance and don’t break POV logic. Rhythm and diction are mostly well judged, modulating between concrete description and more elevated metaphor without jarring shifts. It stops short of an utterly distinctive, unforgettable idiolect, but is confidently handled.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently omniscient in a way that suits the allegorical feel; we accept knowledge of stones, soldiers, and fishermen’s wives as part of the piece’s fable-like register. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring syntactic cadences used purposefully to build atmosphere rather than from habit. The perceptual signature—attentive to pattern, effort, and craft objects—is distinct and consistent throughout. There is no dialogue to test, but interior and narrative voice cohere into a memorable, unified sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, matching the pragmatic, analytic mindset of a professional debunker without lapsing into jargon. Prose modulates well between descriptive and reflective, and the narrative vantage never wobbles into omniscience. While a few lines feel generic-philosophical, most of the diction stays inside a believable register for Marcus. There’s a distinct enough perceptual signature (attention to evidence, patterns, and falsification) to keep it from sounding like committee narration.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Marlowe-specific—equal parts scientist, mystic, and radio nerd. Diction (“variant allegiance,” “world’s dreaming circuits,” “when gods die, they become frequencies”) feels of a piece with her hybrid mind. Rhythm varies well between long, incantatory lines and tighter, more technical beats, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narration edges toward authorially ornate rather than stressed-character-frayed, but it never breaks plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits Marcus’s poetic, marginal existence. Phrasing like “lonesome splendor” and “speechless tides of memory” feels deliberate rather than generic, and Elena’s spoken idiom reads plausibly for her age and history. There is a slight omniscient sweep in “Within weeks, Marcus’s collection would transform…,” but it aligns with the established narrative stance and doesn’t confuse focalization. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and stable without slipping into mannered excess.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a distinct lexicon that fuses technical (“frequencies,” “molecular structure”) and mystical language in ways that match Mira’s mind. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with long, lyric sentences balanced by clearer, functional beats around actions like key insertion and humming. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; even the closing omniscient-ish image of “if you knew how to look” feels like a gentle widening rather than a break. A few phrases tilt toward high-register abstraction, but they stay within the established tonal band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, blending technical detail (“thirty-seven degrees above the horizon”) with lyrical phrasing in a way that feels like Kira’s focused, austere consciousness. Diction and rhythm support the mood of restrained intensity, and the lone line of dialogue from Tomás is unobtrusive and functional. There is no POV leakage or artificial suspense via withheld information; the narrative’s confidence and distance remain stable. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without overreaching into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits Margot’s analytical profession and the story’s quasi-mythic aspirations. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving from observational to more lyrical as the memories intensify without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator’s confidence in describing supernatural experiences still feels anchored in Margot’s sensory and emotional responses. Some phrasing edges toward generalized abstraction, but the overall perceptual signature remains distinct and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and mostly stable in distance, with a clear perceptual preference for light, mechanism, and gesture that suits the subject. Dialogue is natural and purpose-driven, with “second opinions” and “maybe we deserve better” carrying layered subtext. There is minor bleed between Marcus’s and Eliza’s interior registers, but not enough to confuse focalization or flatten them. Overall, the rhythmic control and descriptive choices feel deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct blend of mechanical and quasi-mystical diction (“yearning algorithm,” “copper veins like molten ambition”) that suits the premise. POV is stable and focused through Pioneer with an omniscient-ish tilt that still honors her perceptual logic. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Sprocket’s grinding skepticism contrasting Pioneer's abstract, possibility-focused speech. Rhythms modulate well between dense description and cleaner declarative beats at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a textured but controlled mix of technical and lyrical diction that suits a “data archaeologist.” Lila’s perceptions (metadata, cached views, static as signal) feel distinct and character-specific. There’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts, and the narrative confidently carries a slightly elevated register without slipping into essayistic abstraction. Occasional thesis-like sentences skim the edge of over-explicitness, but they don’t fracture the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s calm, perceptive character. Diction (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “emotional architecture”) is elevated but unified, and the narrative stance stays within her worldview without head-hopping. Dialogue is spare yet purposeful, with the keeper’s grave simplicity distinct from Mira’s more interior focus. Occasional explanatory lines slightly flatten the otherwise textured voice, but control remains high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (musicalization of ice, reality as “water in cupped palms,” “fold in patience”). Diction and rhythm suit Marlene’s reflective, altered state without drifting into academic or corporate registers; psychic distance is well controlled. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-distinct, especially the Inuit grandmother’s line about the ice’s “breathing before the break.” A few abstract phrases verge on over-articulation, but they remain legible and in-character rather than feeling like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly colored by Marcus’s sensibility. Sentence rhythm modulates well between reflective backstory and present-tense interaction. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying motive and history without feeling expository.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, with a consistent elevated-fantasy register that fits the world and never slips into jarring modernism or clinical jargon. Lexicon and syntax support a calm, ritualistic atmosphere while still remaining clear. Dialogue is sparse but functional and differentiated enough (e.g., Marcus vs. the prophet) and always serves plot or theme. The piece doesn’t quite develop a uniquely idiosyncratic rhythm or wildly distinctive idiom, but it’s solidly above-average and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and closely aligned with an archivist’s sensibility, favoring patterns, objects, and careful metaphor (“maps of grief,” “traced as vines climb”). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with a clear perceptual signature that makes the narrator feel particular rather than generic. Occasional elevated or aphoristic lines flirt with abstraction, but they remain internally consistent with the chosen voice. Overall, the POV and style feel confident and unified, if slightly polished-sentential rather than raw under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a language-obsessed professor—elevated but not implausibly so. The perceptual signature—the way she notices etymological and lexical implications in everything—is distinct and steady. POV is clean, with no head-hopping and smoothly handled shifts between present perception and reflective backstory. Occasional abstract statements brush against essayistic exposition, but they don’t meaningfully damage the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative modulation from tension to charged calm is well handled. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without tipping into self-conscious showiness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with lyrical yet controlled diction that matches Maya’s sensibility and profession. The narration filters details through her priorities (sounds, light, tactility) in a way that feels like a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural and functional, avoiding exposition dumps. There’s little risk or experimentation in focalization, but the execution is solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and well controlled, with a consistent, mildly elevated diction that fits a rune scholar in a baroque magical-scientific setting. The voice has a distinct texture—phrases like “shadows that fell upward at noon” and “places where shadows gathered when they fled the noon sun” carry conceptual charge without confusion. Exposition stays within what Lyra could plausibly infer or learn from the automaton; there’s no jarring register shift or head-hopping. While effective and polished, the voice could be slightly more idiosyncratically Lyra-specific to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Thomas’s perceptions—skeptical yet wonder-aware, with a good balance of concrete and uncanny.

There are no POV slips or register breaks, though the voice flirts with sentimentality in the closing reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and coherent, with lyrical but not purple diction (“honeyed hush,” “transforming dead circuits into living tapestries”) well-matched to a technical mind turned toward slow organic work. POV boundaries hold; we stay in Kira’s sensibility, and when we glimpse Marcus’s weight it’s via observable detail. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual—the interrupted apology and simple “Teach me?” do a lot of work. Rhythm varies nicely between dense descriptive sentences and shorter emotional beats, especially near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, coherent, and lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature (“feral nexus,” “swirling hush,” uphill dew).

POV is stable, and the narrative distance modulates smoothly from sensory description to gentle reflection without leaks or confusion. Diction suits a slightly mythic, fable-like register that matches Elara’s characterization and the story’s aims. While not radically idiosyncratic, the voice feels confident and unified across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, controlled, and distinctively lyrical, with images like “threading memories through needle eyes” and “mercury made of dawn” giving a clear perceptual signature. Narrative distance remains stable and appropriate; we never slip into unwarranted omniscience beyond what fits the piece’s mythic tone. Rhythm modulates well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter, grounding statements at structural beats. It’s a strong, unified voice that carries the conceit without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without losing clarity, and consistently filtered through Mara’s professional perception (locks, gears, springs as metaphors). Diction and rhythm are well managed; the prose modulates gently as pressure increases (from cool observation to more charged reflections about wounded season and wonder). There are no POV slips or unmotivated register jumps. It’s distinctive and polished, if slightly more expository in the thematic sentences than the best of this register.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s perceptual biases (mathematical language, weights, geometry, oxidation, acoustics). Diction and syntax show strong rhythmic control; long, sinuous sentences suit the meditative mode without becoming opaque. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains stable while allowing occasional reflective elevation that still feels like Mara’s mind. The only minor limitation is that the elevated register sometimes reads more like an omniscient lyric essay than a pressured consciousness, which flattens immediacy a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrically inclined, and consistent with Margaret’s sensibility as a visual artist who has absorbed a carver’s practical eye. Diction and rhythm are varied without showiness, and the narrative distance stays steady, allowing reflective passages to feel natural rather than authorially imposed. The “hauntingly practical” register fits her lived experience and does not drift into abstract jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly melancholy precision that fits Kira’s personality and the high-concept setting. Diction and syntax feel controlled and deliberate, and the limited dialogue reads natural and goal-driven. The narrative manages temporal and conceptual uncertainty without confusing POV or distance. It’s assured and textured, though it doesn’t quite cross into an unmistakably singular or daring style that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close POV is consistent, and the narrative voice—precise, mildly lyrical, technically aware—fits an engineering student moved by wonder. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences vary in length and rarely stumble. There’s some drift into essayistic register in the later reflections, but it still plausibly feels like Maya’s mind at work. The voice is pleasing and coherent, if not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a lyric yet precise register that matches Elara’s reflective, artistic mind. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the diction (“architecture of sound,” “glacial hush”) feels motivated by her musical background. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance remains stable. Occasional explanatory lines don’t significantly disrupt the otherwise confident voice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinct, with a measured, reflective cadence well-suited to the material. Diction and imagery are generally precise without tipping into purple, and psychic distance is steady. Occasional abstraction softens impact but doesn’t break the voice or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a contemplative, detail-obsessed character like Mara. Diction and rhythm are lyrically elevated but consistent and believable for a “philosophical” focalizer, with no POV leakage or head-hopping. Sentences vary in length and cadence to suit description and interior thought, maintaining clarity even in more metaphor-dense passages. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature in how it notices patterns and analogies between natural and human weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with strong control of rhythm and diction. Descriptive richness feels character-specific—she notices threads, maps, and absences rather than generic prettiness. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the omniscience level matches her knowledge. A touch more modulation between high lyricism and plainer beats under pressure could deepen contrast, but the current control is confidently publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature: Aldric thinks in metaphors of machinery, mathematics, and sanctity. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic/steampunk register and the character’s education and obsession. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving fluidly between physical detail and interior reflection without confusion. There’s no head-hopping, and the few lines of spoken language fit the same reverent, strained tone.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (fire-informed awareness, ritual attentiveness). Diction and rhythm are controlled; metaphoric language is patterned rather than random, and psychic distance is steady. The narrative does not over-explain, letting images bear weight, and transitions between present and memory are cleanly cued. The voice feels particular to Maya’s history and occupation, not like generic poetic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (“rain that remembered where it had been,” “sidereal patience”) that suits the material. POV is steady through Marcus with a light omniscient touch, and the brief dialogue between Marcus and the woman is clean, functional, and tonally aligned. The diction stays coherent and doesn’t lapse into jarring registers. A bit more modulation of rhythm under key turns could heighten impact, but there are no serious control slips.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and attuned to cosmic scales, with a distinct sensibility in images like “starlight like dew on spider silk” and “sonar pings” of gravity. POV control is clean and stable; there’s no head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. The voice is strong but leans toward a generalized “elevated SF lyric” register rather than something unmistakably idiosyncratic to this one mind, which keeps it just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and suits Martha’s temperament and the “thundering calm” inherited from her grandfather. Syntax and diction are controlled and slightly elevated without feeling out of character, and shifts between present action and brief backstory are smooth and legible. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, especially the grandfather’s interventions, which never feel expository. The voice is distinct and quietly authoritative, though it could push a bit further into idiosyncratic perception for true top-tier distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and stable, with diction that fits the quasi-mythic, reverent lens on labor and time. Sentences vary rhythmically and the narrative distance holds steady, dipping closer only when needed for Theodore’s realizations. A few lines read as authorial aphorism rather than thoughts plausibly filtered through Theodore, but they don’t break POV. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction that feels appropriate to Marta’s reflective, craft-oriented mind. Patterns of imagery (gardening, weaving, timekeeping) recur in a way that feels deliberate rather than mechanical. Psychic distance stays consistent; we never slip into information she couldn’t plausibly perceive. The voice is distinctive and confident, though not quite so idiosyncratic or risk-taking as the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear conceptual-intellectual texture that suits Mira’s vocation. Lines like “Her predictive models…visual symphonies of probability” show a distinct perceptual signature without slipping into opacity. Occasional omniscient assertions (“She wasn’t predicting these futures; she was writing them into being”) lean more essayistic than character-bound but remain coherent with the overall stance. The modulation from cool description to quiet triumph at the end is smooth and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture and a clear perceptual signature centered on sound, light, and particulate matter. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied; the prose modulates smoothly between atmospheric description and conceptual explanation without losing clarity. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and even denser metaphorical passages remain comprehensible. It’s distinctive and confident, just shy of utterly unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and slightly elevated in a way that suits the somber, conceptual material. Focalization stays close enough to Marlene to feel grounded while allowing occasional broader framing (e.g., what visitors believe about the gallery) without slipping into unearned omniscience. Diction and rhythm are varied and purposeful, with descriptive density that supports mood rather than swamping clarity. A few explanatory sentences about the gallery’s reputation flirt with expository summary, but overall the voice remains confident and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person POV on Marcus is stable, with a confident narrative stance that matches his education level and temperament. Dialogue feels natural yet purposeful, with clear status dynamics and distinct voices: his barbed certainty versus her measured institutional pragmatism. Expository content is mostly carried cleanly through their argument; only a couple of lines (“The university pays me to find comfortable lies”) skirt the edge of sounding like a pitch rather than spontaneous speech. Overall, the voice is textured and coherent, if not yet startlingly distinctive at the sentence-rhythm level.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Chen is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches her age, vocation, and reflective state. Phrases like “traveled stillness” and “subtracting noise” feel character-appropriate rather than generically ornate, and psychic distance is modulated smoothly between observation and interiority. Dialogue is brief but natural, clearly differentiating characters by role and attitude without straining for idiosyncrasy. There are occasional omniscient-leaning generalizations, but they don’t break the lens or undercut the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a tactile, gustatory perceptual signature fitting a chef who “tastes” memories; lines like “memories leaked slowly into her consciousness like honey” feel character-specific. The register occasionally drifts into clinical explanation (“triggering the synaptic plasticity needed for it to sprout”), but it still mostly reads as Mira’s informed understanding rather than disembodied exposition. POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative rhythm modulates effectively between reflective and immediate as the seed transforms. The voice is strong, if not quite singularly astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits Mira’s sensibility and the quasi-fantastical world. Diction (“nectar-sweet evening air,” “broken promises”) is distinctive without reading as authorially generic. Dialogue is sparse but functional and believable, and the narrative distance remains stable. Under stress, the voice tightens without losing its texture, supporting both atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—phrases like “cartographer of the imperceptible” and “this wasn’t silence—it was the active presence of quiet” give it a clear perceptual signature. POV is stable, with no leakage beyond what Marina can infer, and the rhythm modulates effectively between image-dense description and quieter exposition. Diction is elevated but coherent with the sensibility of a hyper-attentive, almost mystical observer, so it doesn’t feel like mismatched register. A slightly high ratio of overtly crafted metaphors keeps it just below the very top tier, but control and consistency are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lucid, slightly elevated diction that suits both a centuries-old telepathic statue and an academic diver. Telepathy permits access to both consciousnesses without head-hopping confusion, and the modulation between Marina’s concrete anxieties and Thessaly’s more sweeping mental language works well. Metaphors like “dominoes falling upward” and “structural weakness in Marina’s academic certainty” feel like part of a unified narrative sensibility. A couple of lines slip towards essayistic explanation, but overall the POV and voice remain stable and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, with a controlled blend of technical and lyrical diction that feels true to a mathematically minded protagonist (“where probability itself had fractured,” “energy neither entered nor escaped”). The narrative distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping; reflective passages are anchored to concrete present actions like rolling the dice or counting steps. Rhythmic variation keeps the prose from droning despite the recursive subject matter, and key lines land with deliberate weight. A touch more modulation in texture—moments where the voice frays under strain—could push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through an artist’s sensibility; diction and imagery feel of a piece with Mira’s worldview. Rhythm is controlled and varied, with good modulation between concrete action and more drifting, dreamy sentences in the daydream passages. There’s no POV leakage or artificial explanatory tone; even the brief exposition about online responses is kept in character and voice. A few phrasings flirt with the generic-lyric register, but they don’t materially harm distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically textured yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that melds material culture (frescoes, ovens, pigments) and emotional charge. Diction matches Marta’s educated, historically oriented sensibility without drifting into academic abstraction. Rhythm varies nicely between long, layered sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones at pressure points. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the quiet authority of the narration supports the themes well.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not overwrought texture (“darker than absence, a void that pulled at her vision”). Diction and imagery reflect Elara’s craft-minded, temporal consciousness, especially in how she perceives motion and mechanism. Psychic distance stays steady, and the prose modulates rhythm appropriately at the climax without head-hopping or register clashes. The voice is distinctive enough to feel like a particular mind, though there’s room to lean even further into idiosyncratic perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident and textural, with strong, character-colored diction (“voice like silk being pulled through broken glass,” “understanding flooding through her like formaldehyde”). Cornelius’s few lines of dialogue feel distinct and goal-driven, applying pressure rather than serving as mere exposition. Psychic distance is controlled; we stay tightly in Mara’s perceptions even as the prose leans slightly elevated/lyric in ways that fit the gothic-surreal tone. There are no POV slips or explanatory narratorial intrusions that break the spell, though a couple of thematic statements could be nudged more toward implication than pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, mixing precise technical language (“harmonic frequency,” “fractal mathematics”) with lyric phrasing in a way that feels coherent to this prophet’s sensibility. POV remains stable and character-bound; we never drift into knowledge or language that feels alien to Kessa’s frame. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, rolling sentences building atmosphere and shorter, sharper beats marking escalation and release. The voice is memorable and confident without tipping into self-conscious cleverness.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct lyrical texture (“salt-thick air,” “deep, geological groan”) that matches Mira’s analytical yet awed perception. POV control is tight; we stay inside her knowledge set without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and diction modulate well between exposition, observation, and the closing acceleration as she exits. The voice is memorable and polished enough to feel at home in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suits an intellectual, historically minded protagonist; diction like “parallel narratives” and “conceptual framework” feels character-appropriate. Dialogue is clean, goal-driven, and generally natural, with clear status dynamics between teacher and former student. At peak thematic moments, the voice leans toward essayistic clarity over idiosyncratic texture, which keeps it effective but less distinctive. There are no POV slips or mechanical issues, but the voice doesn’t quite achieve a singular, unforgettable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature: an observant, technically grounded yet lyrical surveyor. Diction and rhythm are controlled, leaning into elevated, image-rich sentences that still feel appropriate for someone who is both a professional observer and a sentimental grandson. There are no POV slips or unjustified omniscient leaks; the occasional reflective summary is anchored in present stimuli. The main constraint is that the lyricism is fairly uniform in register, with little modulation into rougher or more fractured texture under emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, measured, and suited to Mira’s meticulous, almost meditative work. Diction is controlled and occasionally lyrical without losing clarity, and the narrative does not head-hop or break its stance. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she attends to frequencies, vibrations, and procedural detail. The voice could be even more individuated—more surprising turns of phrase or idiosyncratic thought patterns—before entering the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Mei’s perceptions—glass, light, craft processes—give the narration a distinct texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Shen’s lines fit his role and register. The voice doesn’t take many formal risks, but its control and fit to theme are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third on Amira is mostly steady and credible, with a cool, technical lexicon that fits her self-taught scientific obsession and the lab context. Dialogue is functional and clear, if occasionally a bit declarative (“These are consciousness patterns, but they’re not degrading.”), and the few lines of Chen’s speech are distinct enough in role if not in strong idiom. Narrative voice slips very mildly into omniscient or essayistic assertions at times, but not enough to break focalization. The voice is competent and smooth rather than strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and attuned to Kira’s observational, tech-informed mindset, with a reasonably distinct texture (“brilliant dimness,” “stone eye watching heaven”). Diction is mostly consistent with a competent professional who is opening to awe, and the pilgrim’s dialogue has an oracular register that, while a bit on-the-nose, is at least controlled. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, sliding in and out of Kira’s interior without confusion. A touch more idiosyncratic voice—or more grounded, less expository dialogue from the pilgrim—would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits a reflective, morally compromised professional. Phrasing such as “sieved hush” and “museum of tempered regret” gives the narrative a distinct texture without losing clarity. Expository passages about his career and the refugee ships retain a personal filter rather than sliding into neutral essay voice. There’s minimal dialogue, but the narrative stance alone carries tone and interiority effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice filtered through Elara is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and marked by a distinct sensibility that pays attention to ritual, weather, and small objects. Dialogue is controlled and slightly elevated but suits the formality and weariness of these characters, with subtext (guilt, restraint, power) embedded beneath the words. The narrative distance remains stable, never slipping into omniscient assertion that breaks POV. A touch more roughness or idiosyncrasy in speech under stress could further distinguish the characters’ voices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and colored by Marcus’s profession and grief; phrases like “utility poles marched along the shoreline like soldiers marking time” feel character-inflected, not generic. Psychic distance is steady, and the occasional lyrical flourish generally deepens mood rather than obscuring events. Dialogue is natural and understated, with Sarah’s “merrily melancholic” tone conveyed more through situation and line choice than overt tagging. A few familiar constructions and tidy aphoristic lines at the end slightly smooth over what could be rougher, more idiosyncratic voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice on Marcus is steady and confident, blending exterior description with interior stakes smoothly. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a consistent texture of slightly elevated, lyrical prose that still feels anchored in character. Dialogue is spare but functional, and the old woman’s voice has a distinct, tempered authority relative to Marcus’s more bewildered, searching stance. There are no noticeable POV slips or register jolts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by Mira’s vocation and grief, with good control of psychic distance. Silverwhisper’s and Kess’s brief dialogue segments are distinct enough in register and fit the fairy-tale/cosmic tone. Rhythmic variation and diction support the mood without sliding into archaism or modern dissonance. There’s a mild tendency toward aphoristic lines at emotional peaks, but not enough to break voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a persuasive blend of occult diction and familial intimacy (“onyx-ink cartomancer,” “recipe quantities”). Rhythms modulate well between longer, lush sentences and tighter, declarative lines (“She had come to unfasten something.”) for emphasis and pacing. Limited dialogue is natural and character-specific, especially the mother’s gentle, understated line about witnessing the birth. The high-register lyricism occasionally nudges toward uniformity, but overall the perceptual signature remains strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lucid, and suitably lyrical for a contemplative SF parable, with controlled shifts between external action and interior awareness. Phrasing like “topology of sorrow” and “weightless with a joy tempered by understanding” gives the narration a distinct, slightly elevated texture that matches Mei’s monastic training and the story’s scale. The AI’s brief line in her grandmother’s voice adds a gentle tonal counterpoint without disrupting focalization. At times the narrative slides into a more abstract, essayistic register, but this remains within a coherent, intentional voice rather than feeling like leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a distinct texture (“vibrant hush,” “silk becoming iron becoming starlight”) that fits the mythic tone. Occasional omniscient gestures (“reality rearranged itself”) feel organic to the mode rather than like head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony and generally tighten around key moments (opening the bottles, the volcano’s breaths). A slight tendency toward authorial explanation of meaning keeps it from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits Thorne’s role and the quasi-fantastical bureaucratic setting. Prose modulates gently around key beats (the blackout, Amara’s entrance, the final separation), and dialogue feels purposeful and in-character without over-explaining. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty matches what Thorne can plausibly infer. The voice is polished and competent, though it stops short of feeling singularly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-modulated, with imagery (“borrowed dawn,” “beings of pure motion”) that feels specific to Yann’s altered world. Expository passages about cosmic history and the grandmother’s past mostly stay within a coherent narrative stance and don’t break POV. The diction is elevated but matches the quasi-mythic tone and does not drift into incongruous registers. Minor authorial-sounding assertions do crop up, but they don’t meaningfully disrupt the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—the way Maya sees censors’ marks as constellations, storms as grammar, and timers as vigil is character-colored rather than generic. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, meditative lines and sharper beats around the timer, lightning, and dawn. The narrative does not over-explain; it trusts images and patterns of diction to carry subtext. There is no POV leakage or stance wobble, and the slight omniscient-inflected lyricism still feels plausibly aligned with a highly literate, exiled poet.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a polished, slightly ornate register that suits an academic steampunk milieu. Marlowe’s perceptions and diction feel consistent, and Reeves’s dialogue has a distinct, formal edge that contrasts with her interruptions. Expository moments are integrated smoothly, and the brief backstory passage is anchored in present stimuli. Dialogue edges toward didactic in a few lines but mostly functions as action, advancing both surface debate and covert alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how October notices salvage, fracture, and text. Diction is elevated but plausible for the narrative register, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Backstory is integrated smoothly through present-tense anchors (handling books, the prison-library echo), and there’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition. The voice could stretch emotional range a bit more under stress, but as-is it would sit comfortably in many high-end venues.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly grounded in Marion’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphors (coral roots, compasses as divining rods for regret, stars as perforations in film). Under emotional pressure the prose modulates well—sentences quicken with the improvisation—and there’s no head-hopping or register slip, though the narration sometimes inclines toward authorial elegance over sharply individuated mental texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—phrases like “empirically whimsical warmth” and “laughter recorded on seismographs” feel idiosyncratic yet controlled. POV remains stably close-third around Mira, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the modulation between external description and internal realization is smooth. The elevated diction suits the mythic-fantasy register and is consistent. At times the voice risks feeling like an essayistic omniscient reporting her thoughts rather than fully inhabiting them, but it stays coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, measured rhythm that matches Kenji’s temperament and the bonsai practice; metaphor choices (“color of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat”) feel specific and character-shaped. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtext-heavy, clearly distinguishing the patient master and nervous student. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer for key realizations without head-hopping. The lyrical register is consistent and confident, with no jarring shifts in diction.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the character's background, though it maintains a high level of psychic distance.

The voice tells us about her understanding more often than it shows the raw perception leading to it.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and unified, fitting the reflective tone. However, it occasionally lapses into explaining the character's internal state ("knowing whoever wanted her father's records would assume...") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.6)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice often drifts into "purple" descriptors ("prismatic symphonies," "crystallized breath") that distance the reader. The narrative frequently interprets the protagonist's feelings for the reader rather than letting them emerge through action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospherically appropriate, though it occasionally drifts into breathless abstraction ("quaking reverie"). The tone supports the dreamlike quality but risks distancing the reader from the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("chains singing," "weight of possibility"). The POV stays with Marcus, but the filter is often abstract and philosophical, distancing the reader from the immediate physical struggle of the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person perspective maintains a consistent, melancholic, and analytical voice. The integration of synesthesia ("violet... low thrumming") is handled with restraint, serving as a functional part of her perception rather than just ornamentation. The narrative distance feels appropriate for the contemplative nature of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)

    The narrative voice and the character's spoken dialogue blend into a single, high-register poetic diction that lacks variance or distinctness. The conceit of narrating tasks aloud forces the dialogue into an unnatural, performative mode that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, but the dialogue drifts into artificial villain tropes that damage naturalism. The transition from the stunt double persona to the "awakened" self is narrated smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases (epithets) which disrupts the natural flow. The tone leans into melodrama ("dawn threatened to steal," "excruciating, beautiful patience") that distances the reader from the character's grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and fits the robotic POV well. However, the meta-commentary ("A human would have called this moment transcendent") feels like a slight filter break that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, suiting the setting well. However, the dialogue often drifts into "written" speech—characters speak in complete, thematically perfect sentences ("Neither of us chose honesty") that sound more like a manifesto than a hesitant reconciliation between estranged colleagues.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is confident and lyrical ("destiny could be weighed like flour"), fitting the fable-like tone perfectly. The POV remains tightly anchored in Marta’s perception, enhancing the "wise gardener" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately scientific-lyrical, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, the narrative distance feels somewhat static, observing the climax rather than immersing the reader in the visceral stress of the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmospheric voice suits the operatic subject matter. The POV is generally stable, though occasional filter verbs ("Marcus saw," "Marcus understood") create unnecessary psychic distance in high-sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical but precise register that suits the "oracle" persona. The shift from scientific observation to numinous experience is handled without breaking narrative distance. Occasional phrasing leans slightly purple ("intimate sorrow"), but it coheres with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, blending technical observation with lyrical reflection. Occasionally, the tone slips into slightly over-poetic registers ("frequencies only the desperate could hear"), but the POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, suiting the fable-like mode well. The meditative tone is sustained without breaks in register, though the distance keeps the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her moment-to-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and gentle, suited to the sentimental tone, but often lapses into "therapist-speak" and overt explanation of feelings. The POV stays firmly with Elena, but the filter is somewhat heavy-handed ("therapist's voice softly adaptive"), distancing the reader from raw emotion. The daughter's silence keeps the focus tight but limits the vocal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, perfectly suiting the "bronze-quiet" atmosphere. The narrative distance is controlled, staying firmly within Thrain’s perceptive but isolated worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, polished noir tone that suits the subject matter perfectly. The "music" metaphor is sustained without becoming cloying, and the distance is managed well, keeping the reader close to Chen's perception while maintaining the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and elevated tone appropriate for the subject. However, it frequently slides into "helpful narrator" mode, over-explaining the metaphysics ("understanding that emptiness held more truth") instead of trusting the dramatization. The voice is distinct but acts as a barrier to immersion due to its explanatory habit.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently elevated, suiting the magical realism of the piece. The third-person limited perspective stays firmly with Mei, blending perception and exposition smoothly. A few moments of filter ("Mei felt them in her bones") slightly distance the reader, but the overall control of tone and imagery is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, though the blend of fantasy ("runes," "ancient stones") and technical diction ("algorithms," "procedural") clashes slightly. The tone holds, but the interiority is often filtered through summary.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic but suffers from a lack of distance control, slipping into sentimental abstraction ("tender shoots of feeling") rather than trusting immediate sensory experience. The tone creates a "poetic fog" that distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is precise and observant, fitting the protagonist’s scientific persona, though it occasionally creates distance through filter verbs like "intuited" and "understood." The tone remains controlled, preventing the backstory exposition from breaking the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout. The tone is cohesive, though the high register occasionally risks sentimentalism in moments that call for rawer emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic abstraction ("violent poem of escape," "carved hollows in her soul"). While this fits the "poet" persona, the narration often tells the reader the emotional import of an image rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone. However, there is a tendency toward summary ("This was rougher, more honest") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the music.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice maintains a polished, consistent tone of "affectionate detachment" that suits the magical realism genre perfectly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing access to Vera’s expertise while maintaining her professional shield.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is polished and consistent, suiting the fable-like tone, but the psychic distance is often too great to feel intimate. The narration tends to summarize emotional states ("tears fell like rain") rather than rendering the raw sensory experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but maintains a high psychic distance that keeps the reader observing the fable rather than inhabiting it. The omniscient summary of the villagers' reactions distances the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like tone that suits the grand scale of the world-building. While effective, it occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Marina was one of the few who could perceive...") rather than immersing the reader in the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, slightly detached tone that mirrors the protagonist's "careful nature." However, the dialogue feels unnatural, functioning primarily as exposition for the magic system and theme rather than as authentic character interaction. The "we" of the mentor's voice reads more like a plot device than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits Edgar’s reverence for the library's history. The perspective remains tightly anchored in his sensory experience, filtering the world effectively through his specific obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)

The transition from the transaction to the internal realization is handled with smooth, confident control.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is competent and atmospherically consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard fantasy diction. The dialogue feels functional and didactic, serving as a vehicle for the author's thesis rather than sounding like an organic exchange between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and tonally unified, maintaining a lyrical rhythm appropriate for the genre. However, it occasionally prioritizes "writerly" phrasing ("geometry of intention") over grounded character perception, creating a slight distance from the POV's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on explanatory interiority, telling the reader what Elena realizes ("realizing she was documenting...") instead of dramatizing the insight. The narrative distance collapses in the final act to deliver the thematic thesis directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a mythic, atmospheric tone fitting the subject matter. However, the diction occasionally feels breathless, relying on elevated phrasing that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, but the dialogue drifts into unnatural exposition and thesis statements that break naturalism. Claudia's speech patterns read more like written analysis than spoken language, creating a distance between the characters and the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent atmospheric tone throughout. There is a tendency to rely on "telling" for character traits ("Maya understood both worlds with painful clarity") which distances the reader, but the perspective generally manages the transition from observation to action well.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the "last inspector" persona. The POV remains tightly controlled, though the narration occasionally drifts into slightly purple phrasing ("star-pierced void") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, calm sensory filter appropriate for the character, effectively translating visual absence into tactile and acoustic presence. Dialogue is the weak point, occasionally drifting into unnatural exposition ("How do you oversee...") or thematic sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, employing a lexicon that fits the "atlas editor" persona ("dendritic," "topographical"). The POV remains stable, though the dialogue occasionally leans into performative wit that feels slightly detached from the scene's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but creates excessive distance, preventing emotional engagement. The omniscient perspective summarizes years of action, keeping the reader at arm's length from the specific mechanics of the "magic."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining a suitable distance that matches the "scientist/cartographer" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistently lyric and atmospheric, fitting the mythic tone, but it occasionally becomes precious or overwrought. The "we" of the narrative distance feels slightly remote, prioritizing poetic texture over immediate sensory immersion in the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies on standard literary registers and rhythms. Dialogue is functional, primarily serving to explain backstory or deliver thematic summaries ("The earthquake changed everything") rather than reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and polished, suiting the "futuristic nostalgia" tone perfectly. The POV remains firmly with Mira, though it occasionally slips into explaining the emotional import of her actions rather than allowing them to exist in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, managing the transition between Vera's sharp internal observations and her feigned external senility well. The lyrical tone suits the fable-like quality of the story. The only slip is the aforementioned register break ("hemoglobin"), but otherwise, the focalization is disciplined and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a "filtering" effect, often explaining what the character feels or sees ("feeling its ancient stone pulse," "saw," "understood") rather than immersing the reader in the sensation. The distance prevents full emotional impact during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the morphine-haze setup. However, it occasionally slips into filter-heavy explanation ("understanding suddenly that...") instead of trusting the reader to interpret the child's drawings.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") that distance the reader. The tone holds steady, but the lack of distinct "perceptual signature" makes the narration feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is polished and fits the magical realism genre, blending technical restoration terms with lyrical descriptions. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into exposition ("The artist... claimed it was the key"), and the reflected voice segment risks feeling like a convenient device rather than a character-driven moment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative distance is generally well-controlled, keeping close to Marcus's perception. However, there are minor lapses into explanatory telling ("speaking truth through deliberate obscurity") that filter the experience rather than trusting the reader to infer the dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like register that prevents intimacy with the character. The tone relies heavily on abstract labels and "therapy-speak" ("curiosity," "forgiveness") that tell the reader how to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent with the fable-like tone. It maintains a stable third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the scholarly-fable tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bound promises into reality itself"). The perspective stays firmly with Elena, but the emotional texture feels somewhat summarized rather than viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely attuned to the protagonist's worldview. The "stone lungs" and engineering terminology blend well with the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable psychic distance throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the period setting. It occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought phrasing ("blooming with suspicion") but generally maintains a stable, atmospheric distance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suited to the magical realism of the piece. The narrator maintains a steady, confident tone that bridges the gap between the technical (weather codes) and the emotional, though at times it leans into explanatory "telling" of insights.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, matching the wondrous tone of the piece. However, reliance on filter verbs ("Mira knew," "Mira saw") occasionally creates unnecessary psychic distance during moments that should be immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but maintains a somewhat distant, fable-like quality that limits intimacy. The narrative distance prevents the "cheerful gloom" from feeling lived-in, leaving it as a stylistic affectation rather than a psychological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lightly elevated, analytical tone that suits Marcus's character. The perspective stays firmly with him, though the dialogue occasionally feels more like written prose than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical register, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("cosmic frequency humming"). The POV remains firmly anchored in Mira, effectively filtering the world through her artistic sensibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and elevated tone appropriate for the character’s expertise. The "glazier’s eye" filter is well-maintained ("language written in probability"). Narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally dips into expository interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("violent tenderness," "ancient choreography"). The dialogue in the recording lacks the distinct texture of the character established, sounding more like written literary prose than spoken spontaneity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is polished and controlled, maintaining a consistent third-person limited perspective. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "geometry of hope" and "serene upheaval" used as proper nouns. The prose effectively conveys the magical realism genre but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is smooth and controls the "archivist" tone well, though it occasionally drifts into sentimental elevation ("patient as stone, faithful as ivy"). The perspective is stable, but the lack of distinct perceptual bias—beyond the magical hearing—makes the narration feel somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified, maintaining a tone of reverent hush. However, the psychic distance is static; we remain in a zone of "poetic appreciation" throughout. The voice struggles to differentiate the urgency of the medical crisis from the beauty of the dawn, flattening the emotional topography into a single "dusky harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, maintaining a high-stakes, slightly mythic tone that suits the sci-fi diplomatic context.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is confident, cold, and consistent, perfectly matching Vera's god-complex and emotional detachment. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, allowing intimacy with the egg while maintaining a clinical view of the engineered catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the significance of actions ("The Academy claimed... but Lyralei knew better") instead of letting the scene breathe. The register is unified, but the distance prevents intimacy with the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent with the protagonist's "urbane" persona, though it occasionally creates distance through elevated register. The shift into the "meteor hush" philosophy feels slightly writerly, prioritizing poetic cadence over character immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent fable-like texture that suits the subject matter. However, the tone occasionally drifts into preciousness ("as if the air itself might bruise"), creating a slight distance that feels more performative than intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately atmospheric. It handles the technical descriptions of casting and braiding with authority, maintaining the magical realist tone without breaking the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a high-concept tone. However, it occasionally slips into filter verbs ("She could see," "She understood now") and over-explains the protagonist's internal state rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.1)
    Voice control is undermined by the clumsy repetition of specific phrases ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony") which read like forced insertions or generation artifacts. These repetitions break the narrative spell and reveal the mechanical nature of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative suffers from unmotivated head-hopping at the climax, shifting from Marcus’s perspective into the Magistrate’s internal sensory experience ("He felt his father's hands...") within the same paragraph. This breach of POV distance undermines the narrative control and uses omniscience to shortcut the emotional revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The POV is stable, focusing primarily on Elara, though the shift to the astronomer's realization at the end is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is competent but occasionally veers into "written" speech (e.g., "The contract was breached three days ago"). Mira’s dialogue feels slightly expository, serving to inform the reader rather than naturally reflecting the speech of a "feisty" twelve-year-old in a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("liquid starlight"). The dialogue is stylized and oracle-like, which fits the tone but distances the reader from the character's immediate humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, atmospheric tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The distance is appropriate for the genre, though it keeps the reader somewhat removed from Mira's visceral experience of fear or awe.

    The narrative voice maintains a consistent texture, effectively filtering the magical realism through Marina’s analytical yet grieving perspective. The shift from scientific observation to emotional acceptance is handled with control.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Narrative distance is stable and the scholarly, slightly magical tone fits the archival setting well. The voice is controlled, though it leans into "warm" descriptors that soften the potential tension of the anomaly, and the interiority sometimes explains the magic rather than experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, fitting the mythic tone. However, it relies on filter verbs ("she saw," "she noticed") that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience, keeping the perspective somewhat remote.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a wistful, mythic tone appropriate for the genre. However, the perspective remains somewhat distant, observing Mira's actions with a level of detachment that prevents deep emotional engagement with her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is consistent but suffers from significant filtering ("she realized," "Lyra understood," "she felt"), which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The voice is competent but tends toward a grandiloquent register that flattens the intimacy of the memories described.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and rhythmic, effectively mirroring the protagonist's chanting. POV remains securely anchored in Kaia's perspective. Dialogue is functional but occasionally leans into exposition or thematic declaration rather than naturalistic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately contemplative for the chronicler persona. There is a tendency toward expository interiority ("Mira knew," "Mira understood") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of wonder that suits the magical realism of the piece. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Mira’s experience, effectively filtering the world through her specific history of bunkers and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, effectively filtering the world through Marcus's expertise. The tone remains controlled, though the interiority occasionally leans into explanatory telling ("Marcus knew... lived a particular kind of loneliness").

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but distant, filtering the experience through slightly elevated, abstract language ("understanding flooding through her"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance to match the urgency of the sunrise deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately somber, though it suffers from a heavy interpretive filter that distances the reader from the immediate action. The narrative distance remains static, preventing intimacy in the healing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and suited to the speculative tone, handling the surreal elements with confidence. However, the reliance on the text messages to articulate the story's deeper meaning usurps the narrative voice at critical junctures, preventing the protagonist's own perspective from fully maturing.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and fittingly atmospheric for the gothic estate setting. Narrative distance stays close to Victoria’s perception, enhancing the intimacy of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone that suits the subject matter. There is a strong command of rhythm, though the register occasionally slips with modern phrasings like "visible fast-forward" that clash with the established archaic/alchemical mood.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, melancholic tone that fits the protagonist. There is a slight tendency toward sentimental abstraction ("tiny spirits released from bondage") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality, but the focalization remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dialogue is stiff and primarily expository, used to explain plot points or declare themes ("Anger without knowledge is just noise"). The narrative voice is functional but relies on familiar phrasings ("careful plans unraveling") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature unique to Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone suited to the mythic quality of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Marcus, effectively filtering the surreal events through his specific understanding of music and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and confident, managing the magical realism elements with appropriate tone. The prompt-required oxymoron "uncertainly certain" is integrated relatively smoothly into the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is consistent, but the dialogue often drifts into unnatural, lecture-like declarations that serve the theme rather than character voice. Mira's final realization ("Wonder isn't about being perfect...") reads more like a written thesis statement than the spontaneous speech of a traumatized teenager.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV is consistent, but the voices of Mara and Thomas blur into a similar lyrical register. The dialogue often feels like written prose or thematic signposting rather than natural, character-specific speech, particularly during the confession sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The clinical, geometric voice ("twenty-three degrees," "forty-seven grams") consistently reflects the protagonist's conditioning. This stylistic choice effectively mirrors her psychological state and supports the "mathematics of mercy" concept without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately lyrical for the magical realism genre. The narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to Mira’s perception of the "spaces between," though it occasionally drifts into slightly breathless abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent, elevated tone suited to the subject matter. The repetition of the tag "sensibly eccentric" (three times) risks becoming a crutch for characterization, but the psychic distance and perceptual signature are otherwise well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the mood, though it leans on filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she understood") that distance the reader. The narrative stance is stable, but the reliance on abstract assertions over concrete observation limits immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the atmospheric intent. However, it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("tenderness of hidden things," "soft as petals") that creates a distance from the raw work of painting. The control is solid, but the tone feels uniform, lacking the modulation that accompanies rising narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    The elevated, mythic tone is consistent and suits the subject matter, maintaining a stable distance. However, the voice occasionally drifts into adjectival excess ("impossible tomatoes," "recursive wheat") that feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a somewhat generic "fable" tone that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the storm. The expositional opening ("As a humble storm siren tester...") creates a filter between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, matching the "cosmic janitor" persona. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("perceived," "understood," "realized") creates unnecessary psychic distance during what should be intimate moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "blurb-speak" ("older than human memory, yet younger than the questions it raised"). The dialogue feels stagey and functional, serving to advance the thesis rather than revealing character voice or distinct idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a controlled, mythic tone that suits the elegiac subject matter. The perspective remains firmly anchored in the coachman’s specialized knowledge (reading bird calls, specific languages), creating a consistent and immersive worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, blending a melancholic, mythic tone with the sensory immediacy of the protagonist's perspective. The anthropomorphism is handled with a steady hand, maintaining the fable's internal logic without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is polished and fits the high-fantasy tone. However, the insertion of prompt phrases like "sacredly playful" and "cautious abandon" feels slightly mechanical and disrupts the otherwise smooth focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the "historian" persona. The transition between the lyrical descriptions of the gallery and the sharper, more cynical dialogue with the visitor is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The control over the "silver-blind" perspective is strong, though there are moments where the narrative distance collapses into explanatory telling ("She understood then what she'd been searching for") rather than remaining immersed in the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a consistent close-third POV. The tone matches the "fierce repose" of the setting, though it occasionally drifts into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, utilizing an elevated "high fantasy" register that distances the reader from immediate sensation. Dialogue is largely declamatory and poetic, serving as thematic signposting rather than naturalistic interaction or subtextual maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)

    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a melancholic tone throughout. However, it occasionally lapses into over-explanatory telling ("movements both tender and distant") that creates distance from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but occasionally slips into purple prose ("screaming tenderness" as a narrator tag). The POV remains stable with Mara, though the emotional register stays at a single high pitch without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from "filtering," constantly interpreting the emotional weight of moments for the reader ("scientifically romantic in the truest sense"). The tone effectively captures the "twilight" atmosphere but veers into abstraction at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on telling over showing ("desperately jocular," "mocking and sincere"). The POV shifts abruptly from Sadie's perspective to an omniscient summary of Marcus's future, breaking the scene's immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a lyrical tone that suits the fable-like quality. However, the distance is somewhat diagnostic, often explaining Elara's state rather than inhabiting her immediate confusion or effort.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from convergence; the protagonist, the child, and the narration all share the same elevated, metaphorical register. This uniformity flattens the distinctness of the characters and lowers the sense of authentic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dialogue leans into melodrama ("You're magnificent," "swim free") that feels stagey. The narrative voice occasionally slips into telling emotions ("dawning understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and poetic, but the repeated insertion of clunky prompt phrases ("aesthetically driven") disrupts the established register. The tone is cohesive, but the lack of distance modulation keeps the emotional experience somewhat remote.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "tell" over "show" regarding emotional shifts. The dialogue occasionally drifts into staged poeticism ("Gray comes in infinite shades") that feels unnatural for a spontaneous exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently explaining the meaning of moments as they happen.

Distance control is stable, but the interiority feels performed for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic but precise tone that suits the jeweler protagonist. The modulation between external observation and internal reflection is smooth. The point of view remains tightly anchored to Elena, effectively filtering the world through her specific grief.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, but the dialogue suffers from "as-you-know" exposition ("You're suggesting...", "Not suggesting, proving"). The characters speak in similar academic registers, primarily to convey information to the reader rather than to pursue distinct emotional goals. The POV remains stable, but the lack of distinct voice texture in dialogue limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, balancing clinical observation with regret. While effective, it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic idiosyncrasy that would distinguish it in a top-tier literary market. Narrative distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct signature ("vegetable grief," "libraries written in collagen"). The perspective is stable, though there is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Maya felt," "Maya knew") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, maintaining a steady POV. It occasionally drifts into "workshop lyricism" where the prose style draws too much attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but relies on elevated, adjectival descriptions typical of the genre ("moonstruck dreamer," "symphony of unspoken stellar thoughts").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, managing the high-concept terminology well. The tone shifts appropriately from the melancholy opening to the tension of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.9)

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, maintaining a steady tone appropriate for the fable-like quality. The shift from the omniscient opening to Marina's perspective is handled smoothly, though the tone leans toward sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately atmospheric for a magical realist fable. The tone manages the shift from the cold opening to the "warming" conclusion smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and suits the scope of the story perfectly. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining the "ancient guardian" perspective without slipping into anachronistic idioms or breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is consistent but filtered through distancing phrasing ("She understood then," "She felt"), which muffles immediacy. The narrative voice tends toward poetic assertion rather than trusting the dramatized moment to convey the shift in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending a fable-like tone with the sci-fi elements. The POV remains firmly with Chen, though the dialogue from the plants ("green thought") occasionally veers into twee territory that clashes slightly with the gritty resistance context.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a disciplined, lyrical distance that mirrors the protagonist's dissociation and control. The POV shift to the lighthouse's automated perspective at the end effectively widens the scope to support the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly precious, filtering immediate experience through a layer of poetic interpretation ("engaged quiet," "leaned toward kindness"). This creates distance, prioritizing the philosophical concept over the raw reality of the characters' situation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the magical realism genre. The narrative distance is controlled, though the tone occasionally drifts into "writerly" self-consciousness (“somnambulant giants”).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistently atmospheric, fitting the "science-fantasy" mode well. However, it relies heavily on high-concept abstractions ("subsonic guilt," "binary souls") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for an artist protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "factually mystical" tone effectively. However, the psychic distance occasionally drifts into explanatory lecture to establish world rules, which slightly dampens immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suited to the dream-like atmosphere. However, the dialogue sounds artificial, with characters speaking in polished, thematic sentences that blur the distinction between their individual voices.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, effectively maintaining the "prismatic" tone throughout. While the styling is distinct, the narration occasionally filters the world through writerly abstractions ("grammar of desire") rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is functional but relies on standard thriller registers and abstract descriptors ("ethereal precision") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a close third-person perspective. The tone balances the "prudently adventurous" contradiction well.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining meanings that should be left implicit. The dialogue drifts into speechifying ("The stars don't wait," "We carry this together now"), which flattens the characters into mouthpieces for the theme rather than people in a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic quality appropriate for the genre. It occasionally dips into melodrama ("spaces between truth and deception"), but the "guarded" narrative distance works well for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("electricity through water"). The reliance on telling emotions via labels ("anxious elation") rather than evoking them diminishes the intimacy of the POV.

The shift from clinical observation to emotional connection is handled well within the prose's texture, maintaining a consistent POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently interrupting the experience to explain the science ("Sarah understood these weren't literal fruits but condensed information structures").

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the magical realism of the piece. The perspective stays firmly with Kaine, effectively filtering the world through her hybrid mechanical-organic nature, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into functional exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, filtering the world through Marcus's "sharp-edged" perception. The transition between his obsessive scientific past and his present state is handled well in the narration. The voice falters only slightly when it leans into the didactic explanations at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and polished but leans heavily on telling over showing, explicitly naming emotions like "cautious exuberance" rather than evoking them. The narrative distance keeps the reader observing the concept rather than inhabiting the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, effectively managing the transition between academic provenance work and the magical elements. The tone matches the requested "mulberry ache" without drifting into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it drifts into generic "fantasy wisdom" tropes during the Grandmother's monologue. The POV remains stable with Mara, but the emotional interiority feels performed ("racing heart") rather than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The noir-fantasy voice is consistent and stylish ("expensive doubt," "moral fog"), establishing the Arbiter's world quickly. However, the reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability") creates a rhythmic artifact that slightly distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is polished and distinct, effectively utilizing a "papery" tone to match the character's paradox. However, the POV filter slips slightly with "unaware that tonight's lesson...", momentarily distancing the reader from Elara's immediate interior experience.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic register that suits the "deep time" scope of the story. It occasionally lapses into explanatory distance ("She understood that true navigation happened in stillness"), placing a filter between the reader and Yula's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, though it occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism that feels more like authorial intrusion than character perception. The seamless integration of the "mist walking" lore into the voice is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, literary tone but often lands on "purple prose" ("shimmered in the air like auroras," "symphony... painted in shades of moonlight"). While the POV is consistent, the overuse of metaphor and adjective-heavy description creates a distance between the reader and the immediate action. The tone feels performative rather than authentic to the character's grit.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the setting, handling the high-concept jargon well. However, it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("temporal grammar," "wavelength aligned") that distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice maintains a consistent "distant intimacy" that suits the protagonist's state. The register is elevated and lyrical, though it occasionally risks becoming overwrought in its pursuit of poignancy ("tongues only the heartbroken could understand").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and clear, though it tends to over-explain the magical theory ("she theorized," "micro-vibrations"). The POV stays with Mira but often filters the experience through exposition rather than immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, managing the close third-person perspective well. The transition between present observation and memory is handled smoothly without confusing the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the genre, but often slips into "helpful narrator" mode to explain the protagonist's realizations. The distance feels slightly remote, prioritizing poetic observation over visceral interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent atmospheric tone that suits the setting. However, the dialogue leans into generic thriller clichés ("Someone who needs to know") that flatten the otherwise distinct narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber for the subject matter. Master Chen's dialogue borders on the stereotypical "wise sensei" trope, but it serves the scene's dialectic function efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished but tends toward breathless, adjectival phrasing ("notably receptive," "unspoken change"). The tone matches the magical realism content, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought description that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like quality that suits the premise, though it occasionally dips into "purple" description ("walls settling into permanent frowns"). The reliance on telling the protagonist's emotional state ("mournfully eager") rather than showing it through behavior detracts from immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly anchored in the guardian's perception and sensory experience. The voice modulates effectively between the feral descriptions and the human interiority without breaking consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the genre, but the idiom "the penny dropping" constitutes a jarring register break in a high-fantasy context. This anachronism disrupts the established psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and appropriate for the atmospheric sci-fi tone, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. There is some tendency toward slightly purple phrasing ("electromagnetic poetry," "seeds of solar systems") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a suitable fabulist tone. However, the POV distance prevents deep engagement, relying on summary judgments of Marcus's state ("undimmed by the existential weight") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately detached, fitting the "architect" persona. However, the tone risks becoming clinical, and the interiority sometimes feels like an explanation of the magic system rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, fitting the professional demeanor of the protagonist, though it occasionally drifts into lecture-mode. POV is stable, but the psychic distance remains too remote to make the cosmic realization feel personal. Dialogue functions primarily as exposition rather than as a tool for character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the urban fantasy tone well. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism that feels performative rather than strictly filtered through the character's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close POV effectively filters the environment through Elena’s specific dread and professional competence. The voice remains consistent, balancing the technical aspects of the rig with the somber tone of a mausoleum visit.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, effectively blending technical terms ("defragment," "servers") with poetic imagery ("cupped palm holding stars"). The narrative distance is appropriate for a character in deep contemplation, maintaining a cohesive mood throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The shift to a distant, legendary perspective in the final paragraphs is handled smoothly, reinforcing the timeless quality of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric but slips into expository dialogue ("The Thunderbird isn't just a cryptid...") that sounds like the author speaking. The POV is stable, but the internal monologue often summarizes emotions instead of embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like tone that suits the subject matter. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Lira’s perception of the rhythm and the statues' reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a detached, literary register that distances the reader from immediate experience. The dialogue is expository and stiff ("My grandmother sent this across..."), serving to explain the backstory rather than advancing a present-tense agenda or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into breathy melodrama ("frequencies only his damaged ears could hear"). The narrative distance is stable, effectively filtering the world through Emil’s quiet perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and polished, fitting the "magical bookshop" subgenre, though it rarely surprises. The register remains safe and slightly elevated throughout, lacking distinct shifts in intensity to match the alleged profundity of the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama ("universe was screaming," "twilight surrendered") and abstraction. The control slips significantly when technical similes ("fiber optic") intrude on the mythic register, breaking the immersive spell of the "shadowed nexus."

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, melancholy tone appropriate for the subject. The voice effectively filters the world through a folklorist's lens, noticing patterns and stories, though it occasionally slips into expositional summary.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and successfully blends a lyrical tone with the fantasy elements. Occasionally, the narration creates distance through over-description ("particular combative tenderness") rather than trusting the scene's inherent emotion, but the POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone suitable for a fable. However, the gravitas occasionally feels unearned, treating the procedural planting with the weight of an epic without the accompanying struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, frequently explaining Mira's precise emotional state ("not from excitement, but from recognition") instead of allowing the action to convey it. This creates a psychic distance that feels interpretive rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, controlling a lyrical and slightly academic tone that suits a meteorologist focused on the metaphysical. The shift from observation to epiphany is handled smoothly within the established POV.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is stable and maintains a consistent, somewhat reverent tone appropriate for the subject matter. The narrative voice effectively mediates the sensory shift from sight to touch/spatial awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, maintaining a steady "sense of wonder" tone. However, it lacks distinct textural variation between the technical aspects of cartography and the emotional beats, resulting in a somewhat monochromatic delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, matching the ethereal tone of the setting. Psychic distance is generally controlled, though the use of filter verbs ("could see," "feeling for," "she understood") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, maintaining a distant but gentle tone. However, the lack of close psychic distance prevents emotional resonance, and the dialogue provided is purely functional exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a mythic tone throughout. The "we" of humanity is handled well through the single focalizer, though the reliance on repetitive key phrases limits the voice's range.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, balancing a tone of weary practicality with underlying melancholy. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering details through Mara's expertise. The "offhandedly exact" nature of her observations colors the prose effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice consistently filters the world through Marina's specific lexicon ("polymerized," "reactants," "fugue"). The shift from scientific rigidity to musical appreciation is handled smoothly within the POV's established range.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like authority that suits the magical realism genre. Internal monologue is balanced well with the dialogue, and the shift in Merrick's perspective is handled with controlled interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently interpreting events for the reader ("Miran understood now," "arriving at the close of an unspoken dream"). Clinical terms like "emotional contagion" and "metabolize" clash with the mythic, atmospheric tone established in the opening. The distance prevents intimate connection with Miran's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The point of view head-hops into the minds of secondary characters (Mrs. Chen, Kozlov brothers) mid-scene, dissipating the narrative tension. This omniscience feels convenient rather than earned. The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the subject matter, though it leans heavily on scientific buzzwords ("quantum entanglement," "synaptic plasticity") that border on technobabble. The narrative distance is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Vera’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, fitting the "arcane archivist" archetype with appropriate elevation. However, the narrative relies on a repetitive scaffold for key beats (three variations of "Orin understood" to mark progression), which flattens the distinctiveness of the character's voice and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and gentle, suiting the "reverent" tone, though it occasionally slips into purple prose ("silent screaming"). The final anthropomorphism of the hedgehog smiling disrupts the established mood, shifting the tone from mystical realism to sentimentalism.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice is generally consistent, but the narrative commits a significant head-hopping error at the climax. The perspective shifts from Viktor’s limited interiority to Mira’s internal realization ("Mira understood then...") to deliver the thematic summary, breaking the established POV constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-controlled, suiting the atmospheric nature of the story. The perspective remains firmly with Mara, filtering the world effectively through her acoustic obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the wondrous tone, though it occasionally drifts into explanatory distance during key realizations. The POV remains stable, effectively filtering the world through a pilot's observational bias.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately analytical, matching the protagonist's role. However, the sentence structure becomes repetitive (frequent "Maya [verb]" openers), and the tone sometimes drifts into standard sci-fi reportage without a distinct textural edge.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The prose maintains a cohesive texture, though the high-fantasy register sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally elevated and atmospheric, suiting the fantasy setting. However, the modern corporate idiom "fail forward" creates a jarring register break that undermines the established mythic distance and tonal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the mythic tone of the piece. The distance is well-calibrated, though at times the "lucid turbulence" leads to a density of abstraction that slightly distances the reader from Mira's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is consistent and functional, though the voice occasionally slips into standard fantasy lyricism ("iridescent," "ephemeral"). The transition from anxiety to mastery is handled largely through summary ("Knowledge flooded through her"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience of change.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and unified, though it leans into a somewhat melodramatic register ("accumulated whispers," "fierce hope"). The POV remains stable with Vera, though the certainty of her interpretations removes ambiguity that could have added depth.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like tragedy. The distance zooms in effectively for the painful moments of memory loss, though the tone occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought description in the expository passages.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable, with a gentle, mythic rhythm. However, it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("moment where all things became possible") that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistently filtered through the protagonist’s unique sensory perception ("taste of copper bells"). Narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining intimacy with Kira’s experience while managing the complex spatial transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to melodrama ("dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky"). Dialogue serves primarily as exposition for the plot's supernatural mechanics rather than revealing character distinctness or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and confident, maintaining a fable-like atmosphere throughout. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("inhaling stardust and exhaling possibility") and over-explains the magical mechanics ("frequencies that only the lost could hear"), which dilutes the narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative tone appropriate for the "valley-mist" atmosphere. The POV stays firmly with Kael, filtering the world through his specific anxieties. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Kael felt," "He saw," "He had noticed") creates a slight psychic distance that dampens the immediacy of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, controlling the pacing well. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("realized," "understood," "saw") that creates unnecessary distance in what should be immediate sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone, maintaining a steady psychic distance. While generally effective, the voice occasionally slips into heavy-handed explanation of the magic's mechanics rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the setting. The use of "linguistic inversions" in dialogue is a nice touch, though the voice occasionally stiffens into academic or philosophical register that creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is generally controlled but marred by register slips into academic/diagnostic diction ("heuristic kindness," "negotiable reality") that clash with the fable-like tone. These breaks distance the reader from the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift into the technical language of "frequencies" and decimal measurements jars slightly against the high-fantasy tone but effectively underscores Elara's character.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and tightly controlled, maintaining a consistent noir-literary tone. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through the lens of sound and history. The shift in the antagonist’s tone from suspicion to resignation is handled well within dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, blending scientific and mystical registers effectively. The focus on the "tasting" mechanics anchors the POV well, though the register occasionally drifts into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is stable and the tone consistent, but the voice slips into aphorism ("silence becomes a living thing") and sentimental abstraction ("intersection of sorrow and stone"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond the standard observant artist trope.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like distance appropriate for the genre. The transition from technical observation (cartographic style) to emotional realization is handled smoothly. The voice falters slightly into summary near the end, reducing the immediacy of the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic and fable-like tone that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though it occasionally slips into explanatory abstraction regarding the nature of truth and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The POV remains firmly anchored in M-47’s perceptions, filtering the world through "optical sensors" and "neural pathways" without becoming mechanical. The voice successfully modulates between the clinical observation of the android and the magical nature of the events.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on sentimental tropes. The perspective filters the world through a soft-focus lens that reduces the grit of the situation to heartwarming clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent and lyrical, matching the atmospheric tone of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Marina, though the narrative distance slips slightly during the expository realization about the founders.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Significant register drift disrupts the fantasy immersion. Terms like "collective unconscious," "white noise," and "potential energy" belong to modern psychology and physics, clashing sharply with the established tone of "moth-thoughts" and "moonlight."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, academic tone that suits the protagonist. However, the perspective occasionally drifts into slightly elevated, romanticized filtering ("celestial display," "silver threads") that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a melodramatic, high-register tone ("familiar unfamiliarity," "ghostly resolve") that distances the reader from the immediate physical action. The perspective stays firmly with Marina, but the filter is often poetic rather than perceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a solemn, elevated register appropriate for the setting. There is a tendency toward slightly melodramatic descriptors ("liminal moment," "breathed beneath"), but the control of tone remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally lyrical but suffers from a jarring register break when inserting the technical prompt phrase "progressive disclosure." This meta-description disrupts the mystical tone and distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to "telling" internal states and realizations ("Marina understood," "Marina had learned"). The dialogue feels slightly stilted and functional, serving primarily to deliver exposition about the bio-weapon and the sequel hook.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, meditative register, fitting the magical realism genre. However, it suffers from &quot;purple&quot; tendencies and an over-confident omniscience that interprets every action for the reader before it lands. The distance is too close to a didactic narrator, preventing the reader from experiencing the scene directly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, effectively conveying the protagonist's shift in perspective. However, it lacks a distinct textural signature, relying on standard thriller cadences that do not elevate the material beyond its genre function.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a high-lyric register that suits the "lonely visionary" archetype. It remains stable throughout, though the relentless poeticism risks distancing the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on sentimental clichés ("tears carved clean tracks," "trembling hands"). While the tone matches the fable-like intent, the lack of distinct perceptual distance makes the emotion feel performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching the "fleshly ethereal" tone requirement. The shift from technical observation to mythic resonance is handled smoothly. There are no POV slips, and the distance is managed well to show Mira's internal state during the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and maintains a consistent Third Person Limited perspective. The tone perfectly matches the "quiet revolution" concept, blending technical observation with lyricism. Elision is handled well, keeping the focus on the immediate ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice is consistent but relies on filtering ("she saw," "she experienced") to convey core content; the shift from detached observer to "baptized" liberator feels slightly grandiose for the established POV.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The POV (Marcus) is consistent and observant, maintaining a respectful distance from Eliza's grief. The voice leans toward the lyrical and elevated ("broken shafts of gold," "blessing what was broken"), which fits the tone but occasionally feels authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, maintaining a cohesive tone throughout. However, the dialogue frequently drifts into staged philosophical declamation ("I speak in possibilities") that feels performative and lowers the sense of authentic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but slips into artificiality during dialogue, which serves primarily to deliver thematic payloads ("You're describing negative capability"). The tone is cohesive, but the characters speak with a uniform, slightly elevated distinctness that feels stage-managed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, albeit standard, high-fantasy register. Dialogue is stiff and functional ("The parapet is restless. It knows."), serving primarily to advance exposition rather than reveal character nuance or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the emotional significance of every object immediately. The tone leans into sentimentality ("patient as memory") that distances the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the protagonist. However, the reliance on a specific syntactic template ("like [noun]") becomes a distracting artifact, reducing the distinctness of the POV's perception by filtering it through repetitive comparative structures.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately atmospheric for the "tidal longing" tone. The psychic distance is well-controlled, staying close to Ezra’s perception without head-hopping, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly generic poeticism ("profound weight of time").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical jargon with lyrical abstraction ("quantum gaps," "ephemeral"). It maintains a distinct "sage" persona, though it occasionally slips into explanatory mode at the end to ensure the reader understands the thematic takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the musical subject matter. However, the tone frequently drifts into sentimentality, using phrases like "beautiful and terrible and true" that soften the emotional impact of the tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of academic precision that matches the protagonist's character. The distance is well-calibrated, allowing access to Lyra's deductions while preserving the mystery of the external phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism genre. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into aphorism ("mistakes were just stars waiting to form constellations") that feels more like written poetry than natural speech between siblings.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("zephyr bloom," "conspired to create stillness"). The POV remains stable, but the tone sometimes prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over immediate character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the repetitive use of the phrase "honeyed hush," which appears in both the opening and closing. The tone verges on preciousness, creating a distance that feels more like an idealized fable than a grounded human moment.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a magic realist piece. However, it suffers from a "writerly" self-consciousness, prioritizing lyrical cadence over distinct character perception. The "lucidly watchful" tag feels like an authorial assertion of competence rather than a demonstrated mode of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone but drifts into sentimental abstraction ("impossible grace," "golden stories"). The distance feels too great to access Elara's specific internal experience, relying instead on "twee" descriptors that distance the reader from the gritty reality of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone suited to the magical realism genre. Control over the protagonist's specialized perspective is strong, though the narration occasionally drifts into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and measured, matching the atmospheric content perfectly. The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying close to Mara's professional perception without slipping into unearned omniscience or melodrama.

    The voice is consistent and lyrical, suited to the contemplative mood. The shift from grief to acceptance is handled with a steady, intimate narrative distance that maintains focus on Margaret's internal state without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, managing the surreal elements with a grounded, melancholic tone that suits the protagonist's weathered nature. The transition between the physical mechanics of the ride and the metaphysical mechanics of the timeline is handled with smooth, controlled diction.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into sentimental abstraction ("maze of our own intentions"), creating distance from immediate experience. The narrator asserts emotional states ("stoic wonder") rather than evoking them through specific perception or physiological response.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the protagonist's scribe background. The tone modulates effectively between the cold sanctuary and the warm memories, maintaining a cohesive "petrichor nostalgia" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and professional, maintaining a steady contemplative tone. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Mara understood now," "She realized") distances the reader from the immediacy of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated meditative tone suitable for the content. However, reliance on filter verbs ("she thought about," "she'd learned") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately elevated for the lyric mode. The transition between physical presence and projection is handled smoothly without confusing the reader's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    The high-fantasy voice is generally consistent but slides into purple phrasing ("metallic lament," "meditation"). The final paragraph breaks the established limited POV to show the city's reaction—knowledge Aldric cannot possess—distancing the reader from the protagonist's specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a solemn, lyrical tone throughout. However, the register sometimes feels overly "writerly" and detached, prioritizing poetic turns of phrase over the gritty immediacy of a firefighter's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overwrought, purple register ("patient fury of geological ages," "defiant hush") that distances the reader. The POV filters the world through high-concept abstractions rather than immediate experience, making the emotional beats feel performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical, mythic quality appropriate for the genre. While the tone is cohesive, it risks monotony, maintaining a high-level distant register that prevents intimacy with the protagonist's struggle. The "sentimentalist" perspective is well-maintained, filtering the cosmos through an emotional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reverent tone that suits the subject matter. The shift between Martha’s solitary work and the collective gathering is handled smoothly. Dialogue is serviceable but occasionally stiff, particularly the grandfather’s instructional lines, which feel staged rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the fable-like quality. However, the distance often feels expository, prioritizing the explanation of the magic system and the protagonist's realizations over the immediate sensory experience of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the "velveteen" atmosphere. The transition from observation to epiphany is smooth, though the repetition of prompt phrases ("uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom") draws attention to the artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    The POV is unstable; it establishes Mira's perspective but drifts into convenient omniscience during the meeting (accessing Vance's thoughts, the engineer's drifting eyes) while Mira watches from a tower. This head-hopping dissolves tension and breaks the narrative anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but leans heavily on exposition to explain the magic system ("Mariel had discovered...") and the history, creating a distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and atmospheric, suiting the somber tone. However, it maintains a slight emotional distance, occasionally relying on filter verbs ("She heard," "She saw") that dilute the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the "philosopher" persona. Dialogue drives the plot but occasionally feels stiff or expository ("The metallurgy confirms what you want to believe"), sounding more like written arguments than spontaneous speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical melancholia that fits the subject matter. However, the POV occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("carpet of traveled stillness") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies on filter verbs ("She could taste," "Mira felt") that distance the reader. The perspective occasionally drifts into authorial explanation of the character's traits rather than embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the sci-fi and fable-like elements effectively. Internal monologue and dialogue are distinct and serve the character's unique constraint well.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and suits the genre, though it occasionally lapses into "telling" the emotional weight ("profound," "sacred") rather than trusting the imagery to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative head-hops between Thessaly and Marina within the same scene without section breaks (e.g., paragraphs 2-4), diluting intimacy and violating the short-form scope default. The rapid switching prevents deep grounding in either character's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a disciplined consistency, filtering all perception through Marcus's "architect-turned-prophet" lexicon. Phrases like "probability itself had fractured" and "entropy disguised as wear" establish a distinct perceptual signature without slipping into dryness. The psychic distance is well-calibrated, close enough to feel the grief but detached enough to observe the math.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, often summarizing emotional states ("most moving were the stories") instead of dramatizing them. The POV distance is stable, but the reliance on "telling" the reader the significance of the scripts robs the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, but relies on filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew," "she thought") which creates unnecessary psychic distance. The tone matches the gothic/melancholy content well.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospherically consistent, blending technical precision with lyrical observation. The tone matches the "bleak exhilaration" of the protagonist, though some phrasings drift into slightly purple territory ("darker than absence").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a gothic, slightly fevered tone that suits the subject matter. POV control is tight, effectively filtering the surreal environment through Mara’s specific trauma without head-hopping or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct, successfully blending maritime, musical, and semi-scientific registers ("sonic engineering," "cloud-script") to create a fable-like tone. The narrative distance is consistent, though the shift to technical jargon ("dubbed," "frequency") occasionally clashes slightly with the mystic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suiting the genre well. There is minor distancing through filter verbs ("She understood now," "She heard it") that could be removed to increase immediacy during the high-tension observation scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "historian" persona. However, the dialogue frequently drifts into exposition to explain the world-building, and the POV occasionally relies on clichés ("conflict in his eyes") rather than unique perceptual details.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent and appropriate for the melancholic, archival tone, matching the protagonist's worldview. The perspective remains firmly anchored, though it occasionally leans into elevated abstraction to convey significance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a "tranquilly perceptive" distance that suits the librarian archetype while conveying urgency. The perspective remains tightly anchored to Mira’s sensory experience, particularly the tactile and auditory details of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the fable-like tone. However, it occasionally slips into explanatory filtering ("Mei's crafty nature... served her well") that creates distance between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and controls the pacing well, though it occasionally slips into melodramatic abstraction ("glow... with possibility itself"). The scientific authority feels plausible enough to support the speculative premise.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice is polished, though it leans into elevated, slightly purple diction ("stone eye watching heaven"). Dialogue serves almost exclusively as an exposition channel for the pilgrim, lacking naturalism or distinct character voice beyond "mystic."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, carrying a melancholic weight that suits the subject matter. The introspection is controlled, blending memory and present action without head-hopping or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, suiting the subject matter. However, the repetition of distinct phrases ("furrowed hush," "uncommonly thoughtful") in the narrative voice breaks immersion, making the construction feel mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is competent but nondistinct, relying on standard "literary" descriptors ("fragments," "eroding," "sentinel"). The POV distance is stable, but the tone lacks a unique perceptual signature that distinguishes Marcus from a generic protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dialogue serves primarily as an information dump ("Time travel becomes possible in 2043...") rather than reflecting natural character voice or subtext. The exchange feels artificial and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice handles the shift from human to cosmic perception with impressive control. The fluid transition through the wolf, butterfly, and oak perspectives effectively dramatizes the "beast whisperer" talent expanding into a metaphysical sense without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and confident, maintaining a consistent tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The control of psychic distance allows for intimacy with Elara’s grief without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the meditative tone. However, the narrative distance is often buffered by filter verbs ("she felt," "she could sense"), which dilutes the immediacy of the psychic experience.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone suitable for the genre, with controlled rhythm. However, minor over-explanations ("whispered—actually whispered") and filter verbs ("Elara understood now") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent professional distance appropriate for a sentinel. The shift into expository details about the sundial angles ("Thirty degrees meant...") feels slightly mechanical, disrupting the narrative flow, but the overall POV discipline is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. The shift between the immediate sensory experience and the cosmic scope of the vision is handled smoothly without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, perfectly matching the protagonist's identity as a celebrated poet. The transition between technical darkroom details and abstract poetic thought is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but stiff, relying on elevated academic registers that distance the reader. Dialogue feels performative and unnatural ("The angles were eloquent"), serving the code rather than character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and achieves a lyrical, albeit slightly purple, register ("luminous fractures"). The psychic distance is often too remote, summarizing years of history and philosophy instead of grounding the reader in the immediate sensory experience of the work. The prose rhythm is controlled, but the heavy exposition drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and evocative ("divining rods for regret"), suiting the magical realist tone well. The narrative distance is controlled, staying firmly within Marion’s perspective without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical quality ("translucent as forgotten names") that fits the fable mode. The juxtaposition of this lyricism with the bureaucratic terminology of the "Council of Empirical Facades" is a purposeful choice that effectively highlights the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and lyrical tone that suits the subject matter. The transition between the technical details of bonsai and the magical elements is smooth. There is no head-hopping, and the psychic distance is appropriate for Kenji’s introspective state.

Rhythm breathes between long sentence and fragment: “The frost patterns shifted. Dawn touched the rim.” No dialogue, so voice purity is un-contaminated. One elevated phrase—“vast darkness punctured by stars”—nudges beyond POV lexicon, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited sustains tight psychic distance; diction (“thermal phrase,” “quiet fire”) stays within Mira’s scientist-poet lexicon. Syntax lengthens during observation, shortens during fork strikes, mimicking data collection vs. stimulus. No head-hop. The aurora as “sound waves she could no longer access” is perceptual signature, not exposition. Compression is taught early (“silently expressive” hands) and paid off in final keyboard dance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-limited stays welded to Silas’s perceptual filter: “accumulated sorrow… he could inhabit” is idiosyncratic diction, not generic. Compression (“time moved differently…”) is brief, taught by pattern of collapsing days, and pays off in closure stillness. No head-hopping; librarians’ collective “we’ve been waiting” is external observation only. Syntax lengthens underwater, then fragments at climax, mirroring pressure release.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest, anchored to Marta’s perceptual filter. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, staccato for midnight runs. Distinct diction—“benevolent shadows,” “midnight grace”—without purple drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Samuel’s whisper breaks silence with subtext. No head-hopping; voice coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: light is “phosphorescent,” memory arrives as “copper on the tongue,” breath becomes metronome. Syntax tightens under pressure—clusters of monosyllables when the door appears. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated. No head-hop; the ghost’s dialogue is filtered through Mae’s understanding. Minor register spikes (“repository of unused love”) risk loftiness but stay within a spiritually-curious lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lush yet controlled; syntax elongates and contracts to mimic vine growth and geometric fold. Perceptual signature—chlorophyll whispers, cellulose confessions—is unique to Elara’s synesthetic vocation. No head-hopping; compression (“sugar dissolving in tears”) is lyrical but pattern-taught early and paid off at disintegration. Diction stays inside her plausible lexicon while achieving rhythmic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is tool-and-terrain—every noun is something he can pocket, file, or plant. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments like “The chain snapped.” No filter-verb bloat; “feeling the weight of possibility” is the single near-lapse. Lyric lift in final paragraph is earned, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: color→sound synesthesia governs every description (“aurora…low thrumming”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during forge action; no head-hop. Free-indirect stays inside Elena’s diction—“drowning hands,” “overripe fruit.” Compression (“eternal Arctic summer made time irrelevant”) is taught early and paid off in timeless closure. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited lyrical voice sustains moonlit, compressive cadence; perceptual signature filters every notice through light-quality. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within Cassia’s artisanal lexicon (“molecular gaps,” “amber glow”) without academic drift. Dialogue minimal, subtext-heavy; mother’s two lines carry grief without exposition. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for golden lull, clipped fragments at exit. No filter-verb clusters. Meets 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter: “glass remembers heat” is idiosyncratic, not encyclopedic. Self-narration (“See how the dust rises”) is motivated by her need to master panic through ritual; cadence slows during sphere rotation, accelerates when footsteps intrude. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction remains within her artisan lexicon. Prose rhythm mirrors glasswork—long breath-like sentences, then sharp crystalline fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter: starlight as threat, shell hum as maternal pulse. Syntax flares under pressure (“laugh... like grinding metal”) yet keeps within POV lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but functions as action; Jake’s single line “Submit to reset protocol” carries chilling subtext of owner-to-device. Voice convergence at climax is minimal and justified by Marcus’s dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric, oracle-voice: archaic diction (“marbled hush,” “ambered hush”) is consistent and pattern-taught early. Rhythm swells and subsides like breath, mirroring tide and star-pulse. No dialogue, so no voice collision. Filter verbs are rare; perception stays concrete. Minor lexical inflation (“excruciating, beautiful patience”) keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays strictly inside Seven’s perceptual bandwidth: optical sensor readouts, wavelength matches, mop stroke intervals. Syntax is clipped and cyclical—perfect mimic of janitorial routine under temporal overlay. No head-hopping; temporal overlays are signaled by “watched himself” and paid off at closure. Diction never exceeds unit lexicon; “sublimate,” “processing core,” “amalgamating” are all in-character.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close stays strictly inside Marta’s perceptual filter: hedgerows “whisper secrets only she could understand.” Syntax grows vine-like—long, looping sentences that mirror maze paths, then tighten into short imperatives when she gifts the marble. No head-hopping; inspector’s POV is rendered only as external gesture and dialogue filtered through Marta. Diction remains horticultural, weathered, never drifts into Ministry jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Ira’s engineer lexicon—“magnetic nexus,” “atmospheric processors,” “holographic principles”—creating a perceptual signature that is technical yet lyrical. Rhythm flexes with pressure: long cadence for twilight calm, staccato clauses during lever pull. No head-hopping; Vasquez’s intercom line is filtered through Ira’s indifference. Only flaw is tic-like repetition of paradox phrases (“icy warmth,” “subdued awakenings”) that flatten voice peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Marcus’s violinist sensorium—pitch, bow pressure, ink pools—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with bow strokes (“held it as long as his arm could sustain”). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The lyric elision “wordless conversation” is taught early and paid off in the silent final note that still sounds—closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s sensorium; perceptual signature is explorer-methodical—radio dial turns, brick sweat, valve oxidation—never sliding into omniscience. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under radio static, mirroring drowsy alertness. Dialogue (callers) carries regional taint and subtext of evasion. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly. Voice is distinctive enough to be memorable within the genre of urban-exploration noir.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric hovers at restrained distance; diction stays within keeper’s contemplative register. Syntax lengthens and slackens to mimic river-time, contracts slightly at explorer intrusions. No head-hop; POV remains fixed. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythmic control is consistent; no mechanical cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “bronze-quiet,” “wall-whispers,” “ash-memories” all issue from Thrain’s perceptual signature. Compression taught early (“grain repository once…”) and sustained. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Psychic distance tight; no filter-verb stacks. Final cadence mirrors spiral descent, reinforcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Chen’s perceptual lens—cryptic, musical, synesthetic. Rhythm modulates with lighthouse flashes; diction (“orchestrated something different”) mirrors his composer mindset. No head-hopping; bartender and Bulgarian appear only as observed surfaces. Voice remains distinct under pressure, culminating in the lyrical final line.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s synesthetic perception; diction—“teaching stone to remember it was once sand”—is character-bound and rhythmically controlled. No head-hop, no filter-stack, and the lyric pattern is taught by line 3 and paid off in the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyric yet disciplined: synesthetic perception (“frequencies beyond human hearing”) stays within Mei’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells with sentence elongation then fragments at crescendo, mirroring conductor’s baton. Patterned repetition of spiral and mirror is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clot; perceptual signature is singular.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Kira; perceptual signature is concrete—physics-bending weight, shifting runes—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythmic control peaks in the white-flare/dimming sequence, cadence mirroring entropic collapse. No dialogue, so no register drift. Slight overworking of gerundial openers (“Between the drop and the ripple…”) softens syntactic variety in one stretch; not severe enough to breach 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lucia’s somatic perception: “vibrations that told her autumn was yielding” marries meteorology to proprioception. Syntax lengthens and relaxes during thaw, then contracts into short, final footstep beats—rhythmic control mirrors temperature. No head-hop; POV modesty maintained—she guesses, she infers, never claims certainty about external sound. Lexicon stays within a music teacher’s idiom (“center groove,” “natural amplification”) without jargon intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual signature—barometric gauge first, pigeon condition second—syntax lengthens only during reflective beats, compresses during threat (“She secured the message…”). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; technical lexicon stays within her professional idiom. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure meets the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-scientific, matching a lantern-broker who thinks in spectra and photons; diction stays within her lexicon (“luminescence,” “olfactory archive”). Rhythm compresses under scent-attack—short clauses mimic molecule spikes—then lengthens into elegiac cadence at exit. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct (“Tears came unbidden”). Consistent perceptual signature: she sees light first, scent second, emotion last.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a hypnotic, road-worn cadence—“texture of time, rough like the rope’s weave”—without monotony. Perceptual signature is poet-specific: shadows “work differently,” starlight “looks different now,” diction stays within a versifier’s lexicon. No head-hopping; the energy beings remain sensed, not interiorized. Compression taught early (“show me another layer”) pays off when the final layer arrives unbidden.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s acoustic perception; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is distinct—“melodies in the spaces between sounds”—and diction stays within her likely lexicon. Rhythm mirrors musical breath: longer sentences when resonance swells, fragment-like phrases at entry of each musician. No filter-verb stacks; sensory detail is immediate (“violin’s worn wood warm against her neck”).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    VOV is tight third-person; no head-hop. Vera’s perceptual signature—chemist’s diction (“fragrance chemist’s blotter petal”), dealer jargon (“half-truths,” truncated circuits”), and synesthetic verbs (“tasted of a mother’s love”)—remains consistent. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fragments at the restraint beat (“But that would violate…”). Static electricity as sensory motif is handled without filter-verb clutter. Voice modulates from clinical to quietly lyrical without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Margot; no head-hop. Prose has polite, measured cadence fitting a broker who counts crates—template rhythm creeps in (“how… how… how…” triad) but stays legible. Filter verbs minimal; diction within plausible lexicon. Dialogue sparse, natural when present (Martha’s whispered “He kept the library running?”). No distinctive idiom, yet voice coherent and unobtrusive. Lyrical compression at closure is intentional, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lush yet disciplined lyricism—"lantern light like fallen stars"—is filtered through Kira’s sculptor-perception; no filter-verb stacks. Seven dialects are rendered only by report, avoiding caricature, while reed-and-obsidian diction stays sensorial. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for ascent, staccato clauses for tag discovery. Voice is distinctive without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter—pendant hum, pencil freeze, canal shimmer—without POV drift. Syntax mirrors illustrator gaze: color, line, negative space. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Free indirect clean; no filter-verb stacks. Register consistent, poetic yet precise; no corporate intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Morrow’s perceptual filter—“mathematics of emotion” lexicon feels organic to a conjurer-scholar. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“Loss… never absolute when properly calculated” (short clause as stakes crystallize). No head-hopping; glass-eye vision marked by typographic shift (“through the glass eyes, she saw…”).

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close sustains Edgar’s perceptual signature: oxide smell triggers vacuum-tube memory; syntax is hushed, methodical, mirroring his movements. No head-hop; distance contracts credibly under stress. “Sapphire hush” and “amber rectangles” read as POV-idiom, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close maintains botanist diction—“cellular structure,” “prehistoric fronds”—without violating Marcus’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: calm observation yields to shorter clauses as transformation accelerates. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct throughout. Final sentence cadence crystallizes the hybrid stance cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is painterly: rain trails become “silver veins,” exhaustion makes tongue “thick,” sky is “forgotten.” Syntax elongates in calmer beats, then fragments under tide pressure—“She opened the jar carefully”—mirroring heartbeat. No head-hopping; even the woman’s buried daughter is filtered through Mara’s surmise. Metaphors stay within a coastal lexicon—skirts of Atlantic, salt-seeded clouds—so voice feels indigenous, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.7)
    Third-person limited clings to Vera’s perceptual filter: syntax grows more cavernous, sentence length echoing crystal harmonics as pressure rises. Word choice stays within her esoteric lexicon (“resonant darkness,” “phosphorescent veins”) without academic drift. The presence’s dialogue is musical, never explanatory, maintaining distance while still advancing knowledge. No head-hop; pilgrim’s smile is read through Vera’s newly luminous awareness, keeping psychic distance clean.</question>
    <question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; each sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“crystal formations sang,” “shadows breathe”—and obey cave physics. Rhythm modulates: short pulses for disorientation, longer lyrical spans for expansion, mirroring her dawning inhabitation. Final line lands with echoic snap, recharging “bright darkness” without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays locked to Kessa’s perceptual signature—salt, paper, light—syntax calm and cataloguing. No head-hops; psychic distance stable. Prose rhythm modulates: longer accumulative sentences for archive growth, short percussive bursts for valve turns. Dialogue is minimal, natural, sub-textual. No filter-verb stacks; diction precise yet unshowy. Distinctive without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is immortal-wearied yet precise: “solar storm painted… sheets of electromagnetic fury” marries cosmic scale with painterly diction. Perceptual signature is consistent—Vex notices gravity “suggestions” rather than laws, mirroring her dimensional literacy. Compressed lyricism (“hushed thunder—power restrained, waiting”) teaches the cadence early and pays it off in Thorne’s mirrored dialogue. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Vex with modest inference about crew intentions.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; no head-hop. Diction—“embalming fluid caught the fluorescent light like liquid mercury”—carries mortician perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences collapse into clipped summary when Wei enters, mirroring threat. Dialogue is sparse but natural; only Wei speaks, his register appropriately terse. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to the stationer’s perceptual signature: every noticed detail is filtered through her taxonomic hunger. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens under strain (“She charted the sound’s refraction carefully”), mirroring attention. No head-hopping; the monk remains a watched presence, never interiorized. Distinct rhythmic control and diction within POV lexicon satisfy the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“texture on objects, rough or smooth”—is character-specific and recurs under pressure. Syntax lengthens contemplatively then fractures during tide-turn, mirroring Mari’s dissolution. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mari’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited stays glued to Marina; perceptual signature—astronomical metaphors, “myth buster” diction—remains consistent. Syntax breathes with pressure: short clauses when she plucks the cello, longer tidal sentences at close. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat. Voice modulation is present but not showy; distinctiveness lies in the scientific-melancholic idiom rather than pyrotechnics, landing safely above the 8.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person focalization stays tight to Maya; perceptual signature is strong—“her orderly intuitive mind decoded instantly”—and diction stays within her educated-raft lexicon. Figurative language is disciplined: “lights like scattered prayers,” “spiral of blue dolphins,” never overwrought. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for carnival sprawl, clipped fragments for action plans. No dialogue to corrupt voice; narration carries subtext. Only minor tic: two “community”-heavy sentences in the climactic paragraph flatten cadence, but texture recovers in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distant-third filtered through a geologist’s precision: “sublimating ice released periodic wisps,” “earthlight painted Tycho’s walls in dawnlit melancholy.” Syntax lengthens with contemplative cadence, then tightens during descent, mirroring the shift from reflection to action. No dialogue is needed; the perceptual signature is consistent, restrained, and lunar-cold without becoming emotionally vacant.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings to Maya’s sonic retina: “condensation dripped rhythmically,” “vortexes painted aerial patterns she could track.” Syntax shortens under time pressure: “Hands moved faster now, but never frantically.” No dialogue clutter; apprentice’s single question carries subtext of funding vs. wonder. Register stays within depot mechanic’s lexicon; no elevated drift.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Margot; perceptual signature—measurement metaphors, dry understatement, attention to asymmetry—remains consistent. Syntax breathes with her cognition: long sentence for map-overlay, fragment for decision. No head-hop; inspector’s interior is opaque, read only through weathered features and quiet line. Voice modulates under pressure: humor thins, diction tightens, yet never breaks cartographer precision.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person folkloric tone is steady, with rhythmic repetition that mirrors the subject. Distinct perceptual signature is limited because no single POV is sustained; the camera pulls back to “the town” as chorus. Dialogue is sparse but natural when it appears.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is pressure-true: syntax compresses under oxygen debt—“Three days ago, she’d descended...” opens with propulsive ellipsis. Diction stays within diver’s perceptual lexicon—bioluminescent, nitrogen narcosis, distilled flora. No dialogue, so no contamination. Filter verbs used sparingly and only when voice-motivated. Rhythmic control peaks in final fragment: “empty vial... drifted upward like a prayer.”

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric-fable: salt air turns brass green, copper light paints lattice—compressed, imagistic, taught in paragraph 1. Perceptual signature is Marcus’s aerial tilt: he notices floor-level scuffs from above, a bias only a hoverer would have. Rhythm swells toward testimony: longer cadence when carving, then clipped final line for crystallized stance. No head-hop; distance stable in close-third that can still note “impossibility of his existence” with ironic authority.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited keeps steady psychic distance; diction (“starless sky,” “carved stone bead”) is idiosyncratic to Marlow’s alchemical worldview. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences in calm beats, staccato fragments (“The bead hummed. Dawn.”) at climax. No head-hopping; ghost’s voice is external, heard not ventriloquized. Only micro-slippage: “resonant awakenings” is an abstract phrase outside Marlow’s perceptual lexicon, a momentary register drift, but forgiven under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught from line one (“fingers still moving in phantom stitches”) and held to the final em-dash cadence. Diction stays within a poet-weaver’s lexicon—nautilus, petroglyphs, succulents—without thesaurus drift. Rhythm modulates: long tidal sentences swell, then cut back to fragments (“She smiled”). No head-hopping; single POV remains locked to Calla’s perceptual bias. The only micro-slip: one “bleeding impossible hues” moment of stacked modifiers, but it lands inside a taught lyric burst and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lens stays close to Miriam’s perceptual filter—she notices soil temperature, bronze weight, root topology. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“roots embracing skulls and femurs with equal tenderness”) then shortens at decision (“Help me position it”). No head-hopping; Yakov’s interiority is opaque, read only through voice warmth. Diction is earthy and biblical without caricature—“diaspora,” “ossuary,” “gnomon” feel lived-in. Rhythm modulates: languid garden sentences yield to hammer-fact inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual filter: “memories of a future that never quite arrived” is her idiom, not authorial exposition. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during chalk application—“Turquoise for water… Amber for preserved things”—mimicking the code’s rhythm. No head-hopping; POV modesty respected (she guesses client motives, never claims certainty). Register remains consistent: precise yet lyrical, never drifting into corporate or academic diction. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without drawing attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV hovers at Vera’s shoulder, filtering every noun through her astronomer-attuned perception (“dying light like a bruise against cobalt”). Syntax stretches into embroidery rhythm—long clauses loop like thread, then snap short when surveillance nears. Dialogue indirection: Crane’s suspicion carried in dropped chart, not interrogation. No head-hop; Minister Crane’s interior is unknowable, forcing reader to share Vera’s risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled: compressed syntax under moonlight (“condensation rose like morning mist”) opens into longer breath when memory floods. Perceptual signature—stone pulsing, scars that aren’t dermal—stays particular. No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance stable. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for séance mother.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Maya’s medicated sensorium: clauses elongate then fracture, mimicking drip-timed thought. Perceptual signature—“mist-clad,” “lotus-hearted”—is character-bound, not ornamental. No head-hopping; child’s interior is shown only through gesture and dialogue indirection. Dialogue is sparse but cadence-distinct: child’s accented lilt vs. Maya’s translator precision.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person deep interior stays consistent; perceptual signature filters through artist’s synesthetic palate (“taste their bitter-sweet essence”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dream-fold, staccato bursts at network surge. No dialogue, so mechanics N/A. Diction stays within plausible artist lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice cohesion supports accumulative cadence without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual filter: she hears her own future voice as alien, feels the garden’s heartbeat in her brush, and notices the coin’s faces with restorer-trained attention to carved detail. Syntax mirrors sonic distortion—fragments like “sleeping, waking, sleeping, waking” compress into breathless cadence under pressure. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interior is never accessed, only his freeze-frame silhouette. Register remains artisan-level precise (“interlocking dreams,” “visual rhythm”) without drifting into academic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise—wing-beats “scrambled frequencies,” scanner registers locust swarm as “rain.” Syntax mirrors Marcus’s observational calm even under raid; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue carries subtext: Serena’s “Fashionably so” and “plant the pattern” conceal urgency inside flirtation. POV stays single, stable; no head-hopping. No register drift; diction remains within an entomologist’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric-accumulative voice owns reef-shadow diction, calcium-spiral syntax, and insomnia cadence that never drifts into committee prose. Patterned elision (“shyly, unstoppably”) is taught early and paid off in the final half-lullaby. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature remains singular and rhythmic under pressure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric third-person adheres to Mira’s perceptual bias: shelves of translucent blooms, dawn light unfiltered by earth. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual pace; diction stays within her scholarly-caretaker lexicon. No dialogue, so voice judged by interior texture: meticulous, reverent, slightly aloof—matching her systematic gentleness. Occasional poetic register (“opal library,” “garden of extinct beauties”) risks purple but stays motivated by the world’s crystalline aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s perceptual filter: ink “caught light like a prism,” “script danced.” No head-hop. Diction slightly elevated but consistent with scholar POV. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for scholarly awe, shorter bursts at dawn. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. “Carefully reckless” is the only faint committee phrase, but repeated sparingly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person intimate adopts Mara’s surveyor diction—precise verbs (“coiled,” “mapped,” “embedded”) yet heated imagery (“star-drunk,” “dappled resolve”). Rhythm breathes with amphitheater pauses; sentence length modulates to mimic water pulse. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, not intrusive. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is bird-trainer’s—trajectories, tremors, flight paths color every notice. Syntax flexes from lyrical (“dust motes spiraled like constellations”) to catalog-precision, mirroring her shift from instinctive trainer to methodical archivist. No dialogue to distort voice. Register stays within plausible lexicon; dust-mote metaphor is taught early and repaid in final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Narrative voice carries astronomer-poet idiom: “starlight filtered through fathoms,” “shy creatures emerging from tide pools.” Psychic distance tightens from reflective overview to sensorimorphic “vibration of ancient songs through water and time.” No head-hopping; Chen’s interior accessed only via observable cues. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences calm under glow, then shorten at extinction beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s musician sensorium—diminished sevenths, wind suggestions, darkness pools—with no POV leakage. Diction is precise yet idiomatic: “seeded with just enough coins,” “calculated wilderness.” Rhythm accelerates with set-list switches and breathes during rosin sip. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The closing strumming-motion bow technique is a fresh kinesthetic image that crystallizes voice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: dancer’s synesthetic diction—taste of starlight, feel of orbit in vertebrae—holds throughout. Rhythm accelerates with ritual, compresses diction under stress, yet legible. No head-hop; distance stable in third-limited. Filter verbs voice-motivated (“felt herself fledging”) not hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited glazier voice shows perceptual signature—light angles, stress patterns, refraction indices—without technical exhibitionism. Rhythm swells from pre-dawn hush to spectrum cascade, mirroring rising illumination. No dialogue; prose carries subtext through spatial choreography and metonymic glass vocabulary. Filter verbs (“seemed, appeared”) avoided; knowledge stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual signature—celestial mechanics filtered through wildfire expertise, emotional light “painted” in silver roads. Rhythm modulates: long inhalation sentences during star-gaze, clipped fragments when the cloud darkens. No head-hop; diction never exceeds a seasoned firefighter’s lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“he felt the weight transform” is a bodily event, not psychic label). Syntax mirrors mountain descent—initially measured, then accelerating toward the imperative phone message.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric, precise, slightly elevated diction suits a physicist-poet narrator; patterned repetition of “trial balloons,” “equations,” and “gauge” teaches its cadence early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature—light bending through fractures, salt-weighted air—remains consistent and intensifies at the infinity spin.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical third-person stays tight inside Maya’s perceptual filter—“rainbow fragments trapped,” “dusky harmony”—so voice remains singular. Patterned elision (painted bells, painted doors) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm accelerates with paragraph breaks mirroring faster brushwork, then stills on final line. No dialogue, so no contamination risk.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct lyric cadence and elevated diction (“operatively gentle,” “inherited hatred”) feel intentional, consistent with ceremonial register. Perceptual signature is POV-bound: Mara notices light through enemy skin, hears bone-chimes as emotional data. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Minor over-explanation in “grief transformed into something else—something operatively gentle” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but immediate embodied action (traces wood, kneels) rescues it. Dialogue is minimal, natural when present (“My grandmother’s mark”), serving subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains courtesan’s sensory diction—silken, starlight, crystalline—without purple drift. Rhythm swells and hushes like breath during knot-work; clause lengths mirror the tightening then release. No dialogue, so voice must carry seductive precision and does. Perceptual signature is relentless aesthetic quantification of snow, marble, breath—every surface rated for erotic optic—so world is seen through professional gaze turned revolutionary.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s urbane perceptual signature—calligraphy metaphors, diplomatic cadence, meteor hush lexicon. No head-hopping; collaborators exist only as vanished echoes. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into short declaratives as he commits to the reverse show, mirroring ink-thickening tension. Voice remains distinct under pressure without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric sustains hush-lexicon—“powdery scales,” “blushing stillness”—and syntactic breath-length mirrors Mira’s careful movements. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Perceptual signature filters geology through botanist patience: stones are “crevices that wept.” Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral,” “ethereal”) fits esoteric realist vocation without rupture. Final sentence’s unresolved cadence teaches the reader the intended ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person focalization stays tight to Elsa’s caster perception: “technically gentle movements,” “investment material,” “lost wax logic.” Syntax is rhythmic, metallic, occasionally compressing under auroral pressure (“names like smoke”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. The only micro-slip is one instance of “she understood now,” a faint explanatory nudge, but the perceptual signature remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Kira’s synesthetic time-sense—“tasting rust and time.” Syntax compresses under crown pressure—“She saw/remembered”—mirroring neural flood. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on rhythmic control of clauses and selective metaphor: “origami of time.” Filter verbs are minimal; internal thought formatting stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly aligned to Mara’s perceptual filter: mathematical bias, tactile starlight, hunger-narrowed attention. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under tactile discovery. No POV leakage; palace “hums” remain exterior phenomena she interprets. Distinctive diction—“orthogonal to time,” “covenant waiting to be sealed”—reads as her scholarly idiom without drifting into jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate locks to Marcus; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“reality bent like water around stones,” “cellular memory in metal’s marrow”—distinctive, consistent. Compression taught early: “communication flowed through touch and intention alone.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during memory transfer, staccato as grip loosens. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is tactile, patient, fog-soaked: “her fingers reading the curve of glass the way others might read braille.” Rhythm slows to match breathing cadence, then fractures into crystalline harmonics during the vision, all without head-hopping. The POV stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias, never slipping into explanatory mode.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is aged, tactile, metaphor-rich (“roots threading like determined fingers”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action. Dialogue carries subtext: Mira’s “You’re late” masks fear. No head-hopping; register consistent. Distinctive rhythmic control—no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline—”phantom apple blossoms drifted past in the artificial atmosphere” fuses sensorium with quantum doubt. Rhythm modulates from staccato discovery (“She had no memory of writing it”) to the long breath of the final lyric sentence. Compression is purposeful—ellipses in time are taught by the opening sentence and paid off in the mirrored ending. No head-hopping; the older/younger selves function as mirrored object, not separate interiorities.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person keeps consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Prose texture leans literary—“corridors spiraling like chambers of an ancient heart”—yet stays controlled. Occasional elevated diction (“arcane linguist,” “condensed starlight”) fits the elevated concept; rhythm modulates with scene shifts. Dialogue-free, so no voice-convergence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marina; perceptual signature is scientific, synesthetic—she “compares shades of decay,” hears “ghost notes” in metal. Lyric compression (“names dissolve in the garden of forgotten names”) is pattern-taught early and paid off when Marina herself feels her memories reorganize. No head-hop; Coraline’s dialogue carries ringmaster cadence without caricature. The free-indirect line “she’d come here to recapture something” cleanly slips inside Marina’s diction, satisfying 9- band control.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s curator perception: “documents existed only in their absence” is idiom she would use. Syntax is steady, slightly elevated, matching archival precision; no head-hop or register drift. Distinctive sensory triage (smell of old wax, click of brass) keeps voice particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to her sensorium; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. Diction—“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “fortissimo,” “bloom of hush”—is precise to her profession yet rhythmic. Syntax lengthens during ritual, then shortens to single clauses at climax (“She stood slowly…”) mirroring breath control. No head-hop or register drift; the few Latinate terms fit a woman who reads ice manuscripts.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet precise cadence—“shard of hush,” “dying stars”—that stays within Mira’s custodial lexicon. Syntax mirrors her harmonic perception: long vibrating sentences for glass song, abrupt fragments at impact. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices frequencies, fracture angles, star drift rather than color names. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Purposeful compression (“seventeen years polished absence”) teaches reader to read elliptically; payoff lands in final anti-light bloom. Rhythm accelerates up tower, breathes at prism twist, resolves in quiet thistle-seed hope.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distilled—archival, cool, yet lyrically pitched (“alabaster seas,” “crystal whispering forecourt”). Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, compresses during lightning flashes, mirroring the storm’s rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perception is strictly Lyra’s. A single over-ornate phrase (“silent theatre”) is negligible against otherwise surgical diction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person stays close to Kaia; perceptual signature—chemical recipes, burn-time rhythms—remains consistent. Chant cadence carries emotional peaks without drum-beat monotony; diction (“charcoal and stars”) feels designer-specific, not generic fantasy. Dialogue is minimal but natural: the mosaicist’s skeptic-to-hope arc surfaces in two terse lines. No head-hopping; no filter-verb clot; voice control supports pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s scientific perceptual grammar—calcium cities, lunar reliability—without slipping into Chen. Syntax grows shorter under wave-crash moment, mirroring her quickened attention. Free indirect diction stays within coastal naturalist lexicon; no academic register drift. Cicada and star metaphors are voice-motivated, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is concrete, selective, bunker-versus-sky diction. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed pre-inversion, lyric elongation during tendril bloom—then re-grounds. No head-hop; doll “pulses” focalized through her palm. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries rhythm without drumbeat pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax is calm, metric, mirroring a gondolier’s rhythm; occasional lyric lift (“vaulting hush”) is earned by established acoustic metaphors. Dialogue is minimal but modulated: Marcus’s first question is calibrated to “barely disturb the air,” showing professional POV filtering. No filter-verb clusters; prose breathes with scene cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric yet grounded: “burnt fingers against the starlight,” “shadows gasping in the space between existence and void.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence pools of memory, then clipped commands to the shadow—mirroring inhale/exhale instruction. Compression is taught early (“charcoal pillars rose like burnt fingers”) and paid off in the closing cadence. One filter-verb cluster (“she recognized… she understood…”) slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is strong: Marina’s crypto-scarred diction favors financial metaphors (“quantum multiplication protocols,” “exponential returns”) even for fungi. Rhythm tightens under pressure—single-clause pulses during convergence. Glitch texts get telegraphic compression, cleanly distinct from narrative flow. No head-hopping; distance stays mid-deep consistent. A hairline register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” moment is allowable lyric heightening.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited hovers at poetic distance: “standing waves of perception rippled” is within Victoria’s lexicon of synesthetic gift. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for ancestral compression, fragment-like final line for release. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on perceptual signature: she notices phonograph mechanics, light spectrum, bird meanings. Tense stable, filter verbs serve lyric elision rather than hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Aldric’s perceptual grammar: “feeling the cold iron give way to something older” is a knight’s tactile metric. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then fractures into staccato clicks of wooden feet, mirroring pulse. Diction stays credible—“phosphorescent glow,” “liquid starlight”—never drifts into academic overload. No head-hop; even marionette agency is filtered through Aldric’s dawning recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is precise: dust language, braille metaphor, metallic whisper—consistent archivist sensorium. Rhythm modulates with long reflective sentences that contract at physical beats (“He sat down slowly”). No head-hop; interiority stays strictly Marcus. Compression taught early—“dust had its own language”—and paid off in final “accumulated silence.” Distinctive without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s scholar-cool perception: “reading the language of reflected light” is idiosyncratic, not ornamental. Filter verbs are rare; perception degrades under tunnel glare (“fluorescent lights flickered”). Jakob’s two whispers carry distinct subtext of warning vs awe. No head-hopping; compression during archive raid is taught pattern, paid off in sunrise key-raise.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV stays tight third-person Marcus; no head-hop. Diction—“quietly vivid,” “shadow-song,” “negative space”—is jazz-literate, not showroom-purple. Rhythm mirrors breath control: long sentences hold, then release in droplet-fall cadences. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices timbre, weight, absence—never slides into tour-guide voice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrically compressed yet disciplined: “gravity’s rebellious children,” “syllables of the world’s first language”—metaphors are fresh, never purple, and the cadence modulates with Mira’s rising euphoria. Perceptual signature is consistent—she hears seeds sing, sees veins as letters—without drifting into committee voice. No dialogue, so no contamination risk. Patterned elision (e.g., the moment of actual report-versus-cairn decision is elided) is taught early and paid off in the moss explosion, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter: “waterfall’s endless thunder became his metronome,” “uncertainly certain.” Diction stays within vocational lexicon—filed, soldered, suspended—no register drift.

No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is texture-rich, alchemical register (“liquid mercury,” “distilled intention”) stays within Vera’s trained lexicon; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm modulates—long aqueous sentences yield to clipped furnace exchange—without template cadence. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“They said you were the one…”). No POV slippage; psychic distance tightens as coin warms.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric, slightly elevated diction (“spectral confessions,” “weeping made of music”) is consistent with mythic tone and taught early. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for dawn hush, fragments for ascent. Filter verbs are sparse; perception stays body-close (“tooth grew almost hot against Mara’s chest”). No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is projected through gesture and music, not ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: wavelengths, angles, and grams filter every observation. Syntax lengthens under anesthesia-daze, then tightens into stepped calculations, mirroring cognitive thaw. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. The lyric register stays within an enhanced intelligence officer’s plausible lexicon. Final sentence’s muscular count is both clinical and liberating—voice modulates without breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter—mechanical singing, dust geometry. Prose rhythm mirrors hush and buzz of dying light. No dialogue, so voice carries idiom through tool-names and sensorium. Occasional elevated phrases (“crystallized final moment”) register as narrator insight rather than character, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught from the first sentence; syntax mirrors the crystalline lattice Moth reads. Perceptual signature is consistent—frequencies, timbres, shades of longing—never slipping into generic fantasy cadence. Register stays within a print-craft lexicon; the one near-philosophical flourish (“eternity folded into itself like origami made of time”) is brief and image-driven, not abstract, keeping the score at the high end.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric-opaque yet precise: "midnight itself grew teeth" is a perceptual signature that could only belong to this narrator. Syntax modulates from short declaratives under pressure ("Stop!" he commanded) to cascading clauses during revelation, mirroring harmonic build-up. No head-hopping; councilor's interior is accessed only through Elias's acoustic filter, maintaining distance. Register stays within plausible lexicon for a self-taught artisan—no academic diction leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, sentences lengthening like stalactites, then compressing under pressure (“She uncorked a vial with trembling fingers”). Diction stays within a collector-naturalist lexicon—phosphorescent, psychometry, petrichor—never drifting into purple. Perceptual signature is scent-first: “limestone held their breath,” “earth’s whispers,” “cosmic rain,” all filtered through Vera’s trained nose. No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry subtext; the final sentence’s moonlit emergence reads as exhale after held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature—storm-lit translucent colors, grain-guided fingertips—remains character-locked throughout. No head-hopping; even the temporal apparitions are filtered through Marina’s carving rhythm. Diction stays within a maker’s lexicon: “grain,” “cut,”“spiral,” never academic. Compression taught early (“wood remembers” as mantra) pays off in final line when the hum becomes compass.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate stays consistently inside Mara’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens and softens under nocturnal calm, then shortens at the winter lock-up. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The lyric cadence of “petals that caught moonlight like memories” is patterned early and paid off in the final snow-on-petal mirroring, justifying the poetic lift.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Narrative distance stays tight to Amara’s perceptual filter—her archivist gaze catalogs, dates, cipher-checks. Free indirect style clean: “she thought of the letters that had led her here” keeps psychic distance consistent. One lyrical compression under pressure: “infinity of floating libraries” reads as earned apotheosis, not purple flourish. No head-hopping; Marcus’s dialogue is externalized through her temporal overlay, maintaining POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person attaches cleanly to Silas with consistent perceptual filter—“amber bottle had no opening” is something he puzzles over, not omniscient data. Syntax lengthens under strain (“molecule by molecule”) then fractures to dust, mirroring drain. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; prose carries subtext (“golden liquid catch the light” = lure of nostalgia). Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within alchemist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Matthias’s perceptual signature: phonograph grooves felt as “mathematics,” wind that “smelled of salt and endings.” Syntax lengthens during restoration beat, then fragments at tower crack, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect cleanly fuses (“he’d been right”) without filter-verb clutter. Lexicon of dead languages stays within his professional range.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is botanist-poet: “velvet worn smooth,” “recursive wheat,” syntax threaded with hyphenated compounds that mimic DNA strands. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—short clauses (“She smiled, furiously tranquil”) echo metronome breath. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly bounded. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated; diction never exceeds Mira’s lived lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual filter: barometric numbers, grandmother proverb, bone-deep hum. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She pulled with her entire weight”—then exhales into lyrical final paragraph. No head-hopping; diction stays within mountain-weather lexicon. Distinctive signature: storms speak in whispers before they scream.

Diction stays within plausible lexicon for centuries-old AI. No head-hopping; interior texture consistent. Minor filter-verb clusters (“began to hum,” “began documenting”) but pattern taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mara’s perceptual bias—“white boxes bleached by decades of desert sun,” “hum that shouldn’t exist.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure: “She lifted the box carefully.” No head-hopping; ghost interiority is projected only through gesture she decodes. Register remains within a solitary oasis dweller’s lexicon; no academic drift. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to terse final cadence that mirrors acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays cleanly inside Marcus’s synesthetic register: “sticky tar of grief,” “emerald frequency.” No filter-verb clusters; diction stays within a man who feels time as surface. Rhythm swells purposefully toward the final lighthouse cadence. Voice is distinctive enough to lift the piece to high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)

The kite’s “sharp snap like a breaking heartstring” is the single allowed lyrical flourish that intensifies without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice owns scientific precision blended with coastal weathering—“salt spray on a windless day” sets perceptual signature. Compression in “die at the correct frequency” is earned by prior copper mathematics; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from methodical coil placement to the final shudder, cadence mirroring electromagnetic swell.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Free-indirect style stays locked to Elena’s academic diction—“spectral analysis,” “neurochemical triggers,” “conceptual design”—creating a believable scientist’s perceptual signature. Rhythm subtly fractures under pressure: the penultimate paragraph’s chained clauses mimic the moment she recognizes the script. Marcus’s dialogue is utilitarian, but that fits his role as data-anchor; his flatness is a deliberate contrast, not a lapse. No head-hop, no register drift; voice remains internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the coachman’s ceremonial stance; diction (“salt-sweet air,” “calcium embrace”) is elevated yet consistent with a man who speaks dead tongues. Sentence rhythm swells and contracts—long anaphoric rolls for planting, clipped fragments for gull translation—mirroring task and perception. No dialogue, so voice distinction is carried entirely through perceptual filter, which remains idiosyncratic and controlled. One brief template cadence (season/year/decade) is the only minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays inside Sage’s sensory frame; no head-hop. Diction—“scarred muzzle,” “tower-stacks of crushed automobiles”—is bloodhound-particular, never academic. Rhythm grows breathless during crater descent, then lengthens into the valley hush. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is direct: “leaf glowed like trapped sunlight.”

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays tightly lashed to Kira’s navigator diction: “taffy across hours,” “photons remembered in gold.” Rhythm swells and compresses with her pulses of insight; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice never converges. Grandmother’s idiom is filtered through Kira’s memory, maintaining single perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Renn; perceptual signature is tactile-thief: “trained fingers already reading emanations.” Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during swap, longer lyric sweep at sky reversal.

Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich (“You’re destroying priceless knowledge” / “I’m amending it”).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marina’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens when she spells, shortens when interrupted, mimicking breath control. Diction—“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless”—remains within the lexicon of someone who has read too many communiqués.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays glued to the seer’s fingertip perception; no head-hop. Diction—“silver-blind,” “book-lined walls that rose into darkness”—is sensuous and specific to her synesthesia. Rhythm mirrors pressure: long, liquid sentences for mercury visions; clipped parataxis when she kneels. The only dialogue is her single whisper, keeping voice pure. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is tactile, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays tight to Kaspar’s perceptual signature: chess notation metaphors, tactile obsession with copper pieces, synesthetic treatment of silence as weave-able material. Diction remains within a tutor’s lexicon; rhythm accelerates during thread-pulling sequence, then lengthens into resigned cadence at exit. No dialogue, so voice distinction and quote mechanics not tested. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is strong—artist’s synesthetic ear, “words are prisms”—maintained in diction and metaphor. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for misty awe, staccato for bootsteps. Filter verbs are minimal; only one “she felt” appears and is justified by tactile cold. No head-hop; interiority stays strictly Kira. Non-standard grammar is absent; voice remains clean yet textured.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature filters every observation through alchemist-trained attention: gears = breathing organs, cracks = rivers of gold. Syntax compresses under pressure—sentence fragments mirror tilting floor. No head-hop; interior access stays rigorously limited to Mira. Metaphoric pattern (kintsugi, quilting, alchemy) is taught early and paid off in final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter: “her movements both tender and distant” fuses physical and emotional distance.

Dialogue absent; no voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is Mara-centric: heat-crazed paint bruise-healing into gold, stone’s ancient pulse, vial warm as a living thing—metaphors rooted in keeper-body and lighthouse-body. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“trembling fingers,” “screaming tenderness”—then elongates as Thomas materializes. No head-hopping; Thomas’s voice is wind-through-leaves, filtered through Mara’s perception. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Marina’s synesthetic perception; diction (“patchwork navigator,” “geography of loss”) is idiosyncratic yet coherent. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she could hardly lift”) not obscuring. Compression taught early (“sewn herself back together”) pays off in final “stitched together from loss and duty.” Dialogue sparse, natural under radio static.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices rust, root-resistance, and fungal aroma in forager hierarchy. Syntax lengthens under duress, fragments when she drinks—“For a moment, nothing. Then, blessed silence.”—mirroring physiological relief. No head-hop; single POV is coherent. Voice avoids 19th-century pastiche while letting antique diction (“alienists”, “belladonna”) surface through her textual research, credible for a scavenger of banned books.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The perceptual signature is lighthouse-haunted: moonstone colors, sweep-timed gaps, salt crust, and “softly persistent” as a mantra that threads through diction. Syntax tightens into fragmentary coils under pressure—“He began timing them against his pulse”—mirroring the rotating beam. Free indirect style is clean: “He understood then” slides seamlessly into Magnus’s diction without filter verbs. No head-hopping; the single POV holds with modest confidence calibrated to a man who reads objects, not minds.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric yet disciplined, syntax lengthening then compressing with Marcus’s breath. Lexicon stays within a cartographer’s sensory wheelhouse—brass, scale markers, kudzu, limestone—never drifting into writerly showpiece. Perceptual signature is consistent: every noun is something a lonely map dealer would finger or catalog. No dialogue, so no contamination; interior monologue is concrete (“the matrix chip grew warm”) rather than expository.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays locked to Seraphina with no head-hop; perceptual signature is regal yet fatigued—“crowns feel like shackles.” Syntax lengthens under duress, contracts at the end: “Together they rose…” mirroring dissolution. Figurative choices—starlight “bleeding,” laughter “crystalline”—are vivid, not overwrought. No dialogue to distort voice; narration carries the music cleanly. Patterned repetition (“another queen, another dream”) is purposeful, not algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lyra’s perceptual filters—alchemy lexicon, calcium curves, dying ember pulses—without POV leakage. Rhythm swells and narrows with experiment tempo; short clauses under nexus hum mirror stress. No dialogue ventriloquism; Marcus’s four words cut clean, carrying subtext of long witness. Filter verbs minimal and justified (“felt the sting”)—immediate otherwise. Voice distinct from grandmother legend yet lineage audible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is fierce—time smells of birch sap, memory crackles like ancient trees—and rhythmic control tightens across the lyric cascade: “She’d written it after—before?—chronicling…” teaches the elision pattern early and pays it off in the final fragmented soar. No head-hopping; single POV stays locked inside Maya’s fracturing attention. Diction stays within her chronicler lexicon—“never-weres,” “chronologically impossible moment”—without register drift. Dialogue is absent by design; voice carries subtext through syntax alone.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s tactile perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“water sang different notes through copper versus brass”). Syntax breathes with foggy pauses yet accelerates during the screw extraction. No dialogue clutter; the single spoken exchange carries indirection worthy of the hush. One microscopic filter verb slip (“she thought about her lost sense”) does not contaminate voice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kira’s perceptual signature—notice of “captured stars,” “velvet hush,” “liquid starlight”—with rhythmic compression under breath-held stress. Syntax mirrors physical constraint: short clauses when oxygen low, longer reflective cadence after release. No head-hopping; Master Yuen observed only through her filter. Distinct texture and modesty of knowledge maintained; qualifies for 9- band though not quite the last increment of daring compression needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings to Vera’s perceptual bias: she clocks details through journalist metaphors (“Think of it like a dance”). Diction stays within her lexicon; no sudden graduate-seminar uplift. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during tree-fall, longer melodic lines during transcription. No head-hopping; Elisabetta’s voice arrives only via Marcus’s throat, maintaining distance control. Dialogue carries subtext: “Apologies are just words floating in air” both refuses and demands action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct lyric-cosmic register sustained: “geometry defying euclidean reason,” “universe hiccupped.” Perceptual signature—Kaia notices etymologies leaking like smoke, never tourist catalog. Psychic distance compresses under countdown: long sentences contract to fragment “She did.” Free indirect style clean; no head-hop. Rhythm mirrors spiral—long clauses coil, then sudden quarter-turn stops.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited remains locked to shepherd’s sensorium: only she feels brass warmth, only she hears cistern tone deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s mathematically tinged perception; diction—“equations she’d never solve,” “pretty lies mathematicians told themselves”—is character-specific and rhythmic. One micro-POV slip: “probably feeding quarters” drifts into father’s off-stage interior; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Marcus’s technician-perceiver idiom: rail “sings,” disc “responds,” callers “bloom.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens into clauses under electromagnetic hum, mirroring tunnel acoustics.

No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within the lexicon of a scribe who tastes tannins in the air.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistently at Sadie’s shoulder; perceptual signature—“desperately jocular edge she’d perfected in Mozambique”—is sharp, rhythmic, and idiosyncratic. Compression (“Everything worthwhile is technically illegal”) teaches cadence early and pays off in final grin. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interior is inferred only through external cues, preserving distance. Diction (“metallic otherness,” “Conceptual Repricing”) stays within Sadie’s savvy lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is synesthetic, bone-deep: “languages… like warm honey,” “sonic architecture.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses slow to final crystalline sentence. Compression taught early (“Portuguese flooded through her skin”) and paid off in last-line stillness. No dialogue; no POV drift. Lexicon stays within blind cartographer’s diction, never academic.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is precise yet lyric, calibrated to a scientist-poet who thinks in spectra and constellations. Diction—“selectively filtered,” “contingent relationships”—stays within her professional lexicon.

No filter-verb clutter; perception is immediate: “starlight catching the nib.”

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person single POV stays tight to Maya’s perceptual bias—she clocks light texture, joint pain, the absence of sound—never venturing into Chen’s interior. Syntax mirrors her halt-and-flow rhythm: long lyrical sentences for harbor glow, staccato “Click.” for shutter. No dialogue spoken; signed lines carry indirection (“Listen with your eyes” carries gentle challenge). Register holds—no academic drift, no filter-verb stacks. Voice is distinct: “spilled mercury,” “ghost stories whispered in conservatory halls” read as Maya’s professional-aural memory, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct analytic-pragmatic diction (“surgically precise,” “anachronistic paper fibers”) fused with lyrical heat (“volcanic tenderness”). No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal syntax stays consistent and character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric, slightly elevated register sustained and justified by transcendent premise; perceptual signature sharp (“frequencies only the dying could hear”).

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person close stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter—compass spins, aurora flicker, heel-echo signatures—without head-hop. Sentence rhythm lengthens during navigation beats, then fractures into shorter pulses at container intersections, mirroring mental map overlays. Dialogue is sparse and indirect; when Chen whispers “How did you—” the broken syntax feels stress-true. Port jargon (“corrugated fire,” “acoustic amphitheater”) remains inside Marcus’s vocational lexicon, sustaining credible distance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric close to Mira’s silent perception; perceptual signature favors spirals, water-flow, star-glint—consistent with her “spiralingly calm” trait. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on rhythmic, imagistic syntax: “like water circling a drain in reverse, gathering rather than dispersing.” Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she understood”) they anchor silent epistemology. Compression taught early (“some truths could only be taught through silence”) and paid off in mirror surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited clings to Marcus; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—aurally weighted, heartbeat diction (“thrumming beneath its foundations”). Filter verbs serve voice (“he heard its ancient warnings”). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for mist arrival, staccato for window sequence. Dialogue minimal but goal-driven; Elena’s whisper carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is fluid, tidal, slightly ancient without purple drift; diction stays within dock-born POV. Rhythm accelerates underwater, breathes on rocks. No head-hop; Torven’s interior arrives only through Mira’s perception. One filter-verb cluster during whale-song costs the 9-band by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited hovers at psychic distance two, mirroring the performer’s own detachment; diction stays within her lexicon (“soft, forgiving” basswood). Monotone cadence is patterned early and paid off when Mrs. Chen mimics it, proving voice is teachable contagion.

No head-hop; maintenance worker/family remain opaque silhouettes, preserving focal discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elena’s jeweler-eye perception: wire “coiling,” rice paper “tucking,” candle glow “joining the constellation.” Diction is precise—no filter-verb clutter; “wheeling overhead” and “aperture” feel star-bound without jargon drift.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person stays close to Vera’s perceptual signature—light through raindrops refracted into “tiny prisms,” cards “darker than the night.” Syntax lengthens when she thinks in algorithms, shortens when the client arrives. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interior is inferred only through Vera read of his body. Register is consistent—technical terms (“algorithmic intervals”) feel native to her diction. Rhythm modulates: the final paragraph’s quiet cadence mirrors the earned hush after revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“atoms of nostalgia,” “recursive loops”—stays within historian’s conceptual lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments during inhalation, mirrors convulsion. No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs are embodied (“feeling the ancient mechanisms respond”). Distinctive texture: saffron, twilight, bronze return as chorded motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is precise: “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” notices refraction, trembling aurora, softly deliberate motion—details a casual visitor would miss.

Diction remains within a lifelong archivist’s lexicon; no corporate register intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Marina’s perceptual filter—scales “still shifting through impossible colors” reads as her guilty awe. Syntax grows clipped during surgery (“micro-sutures, precise stitch”) mirroring her narrowed focus. No head-hopping; chameleon perception is projected, not ventriloquized. Diction stays within a vet’s lexicon; no sudden学术register lifts.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. High-density lines—“moonlight blazed quietly vivid against the darkness”—do double sensory and symbolic work without overwriting. Rhythm varies: long breathy sentence for dawn light, then terse “She pulled out her phone” to launch confession. No mixed metaphors; “glass absorbed her confession” sustains physical logic. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the final image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s perceptual bias—sand whisper, vegetable grief, chlorophyll dream—creating distinct idiom. No dialogue, so voice convergence not tested.

Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated within psychometric beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, modulating from hushed awe to pulsating surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice owns a hypnotic, grief-cracked lullaby cadence; diction marries quantum jargon to nursery syntax (“petals occasionally everywhere and nowhere”). Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences bloom, then fracture in staccato “Show yourself.” Perceptual signature filters world through lullaby fragments and quantum uncertainty; no POV leakage. Compression taught early (“smoke choked…”) and remains legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains metallic, musical diction throughout; perceptual signature is consistent—“probability streams,” “synthetic leaves ticking like clocks.” No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Rhythm modulates with longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments for revelation. Compression is purposeful; no head-hop or register drift. The absence of spoken lines prevents the 9+ gate but keeps the score solidly in high 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Focalization is tight third with lyric compression: "mist clung like unspoken prayers," "beard moved like kelp in unfelt currents." Perceptual signature is Marina’s—she notices pawprints, treats pocket, leash absence—never ferry-guide interior. Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences for water passages, clipped fragments at shore arrival. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physically coherent. Voice teaches its elliptical pattern early and pays off in the final star-light leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is frost-bitten, service-oriented, acoustically attuned—he hears the fortress “hum” approval. Elena’s whispered line is the only dialogue; it carries subtext (scars as credential) and is differentiated by rasped brevity. No head-hop; no filter-verb clot. Occasional lyric uplift (“seraphically mundane”) fits the hotel’s mythic register and is introduced early, so pattern is taught. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator meta-lexicon, not text; no in-story equivalent, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Syln’s ancient, meticulous perceptual filter: “her fingers, gnarled but steady,” “constellations visible through the crystalline dome.” Syntax is long and fluid, mimicking millennial patience; diction favors archaisms—“tome,” “rune,” “epoch”—without slipping into pastiche. Dialogue is sparse but voice-distinct: the pretender’s honeyed “Aunt Syln” versus Syln’s soft counterpunch “Still maintaining dying truths.” No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses only in the shatter-line, a micro-staccato payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-technical: precise instruments (pH, salinity) braided with mythic cadence (“white as funeral bones”). Perceptual signature—tapping tonality—remains character-specific under pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression (“seventeen meters above what the torn atlas page claimed was solid ground”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at descent.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kira’s barefoot perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“cathedral of rust,” “margin of daylight”—matches her artist-granddaughter lineage yet stays within plausible vocabulary.

Distinct perceptual signature meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature—botanist-precision in “rosemary bush…exactly where to curve toward light”—anchors POV.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is painterly, synesthetic, salted: “dust-breathing books,” “cracked like a mirror that had seen too many futures.” Perceptual signature stays consistent—she notices edges, angles, pigment-behaviors.

Distinctive syntactic repeats (“consciously wild,” “ephemeral patterns”) are pattern-taught and payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Vera’s perceptual bias—cataloguing cold, noticing ink fade, hearing alarms as “crystalline.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, tightens during breach; no head-hop. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” lexicon in narration feels slightly above her idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to hush and light geometry; diction stays within Mira’s contemplative lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long breathing sentences to the staccato of “Complete.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric, third-person distant texture is stable, with purposeful compression—“voicing silence” is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is acoustic-first, star-drunk, cool-toned, matching fisher-of-sound vocation. Rhythm modulates: long breaths during casting, fractured fragments when spike burns, closing on feral lullaby cadence that echoes opening. No dialogue, so voice evaluation focuses on narrative idiom which stays consistent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric, compressed third-person sticks close to Margot’s astronomer perception; diction ("telegrams read aloud by a trusted proxy") stays within her lexicon. Rhythmic propulsion mirrors her accelerating logic—short sentences during proof cascade, then cadence slows into seal-and-vault coda. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Patterned elision (proxy death) taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is synesthetic, meteor-hushed, with controlled compression: “time folded in on itself” is taught early and repeated without drumbeat fatigue. Perceptual signature is specific—Mara hears subsonic guilt, tastes electromagnetic blood—never ventriloquized. Internal syntax mirrors tattooist precision: short, needled sentences during inscription; longer sinuous clauses when mapping constellations. No head-hopping; Dr. Kepler stays external, a necessary witness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is painter-acoustic: sound is “milk through water,” color is “rainbow chalk on rain-darkened streets.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, fragments under tile-heat—“The mess is the meaning” arrives as felt pulse, not slogan. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays tight to her fingertips. Rhythm mirrors acoustic delay: long clauses echo, single grains drop in monosyllables. Minor over-adjectivation—“unsettling beauty,” “peculiar season”—but always in her artist register.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice carries perceptual signature: temperature-based metaphors (“warm coldness,” “cold warmth”) and geometric lexicon (“spiral,” “tessera,” “ninety-nine names”) cohere to Sarai’s mosaic-minded POV.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Narrative voice stays close-third to Maya, filtering scientific lexicon through tactile bias (“dendrites of possibility branching through space”). Rhythm compresses under pressure—short clauses when lattice stabilizes, then elongates as David steps inside. No head-hopping; David’s awe is externalized through Maya’s skin response. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” in narration) momentarily breaks POV lexicon, but only once.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric-scientific: “taste temperature variations down to a thousandth of a degree” is precise yet sensuous. Syntax lengthens during drift, compresses at fossil crumble, mirroring pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: resin walls “catch and hold light like frozen honey,” buttons “sing their particular note.” Syntax lengthens during cataloguing, then fragments at the echo release, mirroring tension. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; diction stays within her hushed curator register even at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Margot’s perceptual filter: “silver hush” is auditory suppression, “engraved pillbox” is tactile guilt, “handwriting in tiny scratches” is visual proof of loyalty. Syntax mirrors mountaineer breathlessness—clauses shorten on the climb, lengthen during the reveal. No head-hopping; Viktor’s interior is surfaced only through what Margot can see (gesture, voice timbre). One clause—“the world spread out…fixable”—leans omniscient, but the sentence immediately re-anchors via her foot choosing the next ledge, preserving distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric is stable, focalized through Mira’s perceptual signature—“prismatic quiet,” “wisdom wearing dancing shoes”—a diction she could plausibly mint. Compression (“She’d written hundreds…hidden them in installations”) is taught early and paid off when the bulbs reveal those very texts. No head-hopping; Chen’s interior is surfaced only through Mira’s reading of his hands and voice. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflective beats, staccato sentence fragments when lights switch on, mirroring the tightening spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s astronomer diction—14.7 MHz, Sagittarius A*, vacuum tubes—creating a perceptual signature. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short declaratives during counter-broadcast, longer clauses for reflection. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narration remains stable. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor disciplined (“metallic sentinels” once, earned).

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close adheres to Marcus’s perceptual signature: geometric metaphors, precision verbs (“traced,” “marked,” “calculating”). Rhythm tightens under stress—short clauses mimic constricted breathing. No dialogue, hence dialogue bullets N/A. Diction stays within a scholarly explorer’s lexicon; no register drift. Prose itself performs spatial compression in the nexus paragraph, mirroring theme.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature is relentless: every visual detail is translated into texture, angle, or charcoal hardness. Syntax mirrors process—layered, participle-rich, then clipped at climax (“She understood now”). No filter verbs; “her fingers finding the detective's number by touch alone” keeps knowledge body-bound. Voice never drifts into clinical or therapeutic register; even “prosopagnosia” is immediately rendered as lived limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—oxidized copper, cemetery grit, spectral cartography—without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice carries a lyrical, slightly run-on syntax that mirrors fiddle phrasing—comma splices feel musical rather than careless. Perceptual signature is sharp: Marla notices wind direction by how it changes the pitch of her A-string, and reads shadows as storm scores. No head-hop; the hitchhiker’s thoughts stay opaque, preserving his mythic function. Diction stays within a traveling musician’s lexicon; the single elevated word “amnesty” is justified because it is literally etched on the object she holds.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at Marcus’s shoulder, filtering every detail through his perceptual calm: “dusky harmony of truth told at twilight” is idiom he would own. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for inherited patience, shorter beats for startup intrusion—without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue until the final exchange, and those two lines carry subtextual recognition rather than exposition. One hairline slip: “philosophical differences” is Chen’s corporate phrasing that momentarily leaks outside Marcus’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is astronomer-poet (“orange petals translucent as stained glass”). Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for cosmic scale, clipped fragments at revelations. Only two spoken lines—naturalistic, goal-driven (“You’re still awake”).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly interior; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is botanic-tactile: time is tasted through sap, scars read like braille. Syntax modulates—long lyrical sentences in calm moments, clipped fragments (“So here she stood…”) under pressure.

Distinct rhythmic control and dusky lexical register hold to the last ash-shaped sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person free indirect stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter—jeweler’s loupe, B-flat hum, 15-ounce weight—lexicon roadie-specific. Rhythm mimics set-list ebb: long reflective riffs broken by single-sentence drum hits. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs (“he noted”) are voice-motivated, mimicking appraisal ledger. Compression taught early (“confidently uncertain”) and paid off in final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyric-scientific, fitting a cuneiform scholar: “wedge-shaped impressions,” “rare earth magnets,” “electromagnetic resonance.” Syntax stays controlled, no filter-verb bloat; perceptual signature is tactile & visual (she sees magnetic fields “twist into strange, beautiful geometries”).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaine; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is gear-and-tide: verbs like “clicked,” “creaked,” “breathed” mirror bronze-ocean fusion. Syntax slows to tidal cadence under moonlight, accelerates during creel hand-off. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual: “I’ve come to smelt” carries goal, backstory, risk in three words. Free indirect slips cleanly into “This was enough—this eternal moment…” without authorial over-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s perceptual filter—“standard inspection forgotten,” “professional distance,” “inspectors’ jargon” shape diction. No head-hopping; Crown’s interior is accessed only through his etchings, a legally observable artifact. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for cave awe, staccato carved fragments mimic fingernail scratches. Filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she understood”) are sparse and motivated by inspector protocol. Voice remains consistent under stress; no register drift into abstract therapy-speak beyond the single self-diagnostic sentence that is itself carved, hence objectified.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited maintains scientist’s perceptual signature: quantified river data, filtered light, tape-as-scale metaphor. Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences for memory, staccato “He drew… He packed…” at pivot. No head-hopping; diction stays within Marcus’s lexicon except one near-maxim lapse. Dialogue absent, so voice distinctness rests on interior texture, which remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lush, rhythmic prose maintains third-person limited distance; diction (“cyclically reversed, consciousness folding through time like origami”) is poetic yet anchored to the POV’s heightened perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices frequencies, delays, symbols. Patterned elision (backward ticking, letter rising like ink) is taught early and paid off at closure. One register drift: “document with cautious exuberance” sounds like prompt language, a hairline knock.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic perception; plant telepathy is signaled through italicized fragments early, pattern taught and paid off. Diction—“mulberry wine,” “perforated destiny”—is character-bound, not ornamental. Rhythm accelerates into staccato clauses as violin keens, mirroring sensory overload. Only dialogue line (“You knew”) feels generic; still, voice remains singular and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “patterns in static,” “aurora’s magnetic breath” are hers, not decorative. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses mirror rising Silence. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction; no leaks. Compression (“she was both”) is taught early and paid off in final suspended plural state.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is vineyard-master: she sees stone “scallop” like pruned canes, hears air like post-harvest hush. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for mist, staccato for branch grabs. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression taught early (“floating above the cloud layer like a forgotten thought”) and paid off in final dissolve of old woman. Filter verbs (“she felt something unlock”) are minimal and character-bound. Voice never drifts into pseudo-wisdom; metaphor stays agricultural, grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice is knife-sharp, aphoristic, and profession-specific: “conscience for hire,” “designer uncertainty.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short, declarative verdicts mimic lighthouse flashes. No dialogue convergence; Marcus’s few lines carry subtext of evasion vs. need. Perceptual signature is consistent: wind-chime music read as moral data, dawn light as ethical spectrum. Elision (three weeks of predecessor’s absence) is taught early and paid off in the Arbiter’s transient replacement status, never breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Narrative voice sustains an incantatory, autumnal hush: soft sibilants, leaf-light metaphors, calm cadence that mirrors Elara’s persona. Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads data in water, feels iron in blood, notices starlight refraction. No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Experimental lyric compression is taught early (“encoded data only she could read”) and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, and tonally aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax mirrors acoustic recursion (“spiral,” “echo,” “return”). Diction stays within archaic observer lexicon—no corporate register slips. Perceptual signature is birdsong-as-notation, maintained under pressure. Compression (“layered dust coated her shoulders like a second skin”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is color- and texture-obsessed (“crystalline walls,” “rough carved surface”). Syntax swells then compresses with risk—long clauses atop spire, staccato during step outward. No dialogue, so voice rests on lyrical diction that stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor vehicles consistent (needle/silk, cloud/sea). Rhythm accelerates into mist-walk, then cadence settles on “brilliant dimness” reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-scientific, compressed but legible; patterned elision (“saw/would see/had seen”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent—astronomer-sailor hybrid noticing. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Register stays within Voss’s plausible lexicon; syntax mirrors her looping cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vocabulary stays within reaper’s plausible lexicon (“psychopomps,” “celestial mechanics”) yet crafts a distinct funereal cadence. Perceptual signature sharp: she hears “phrases tremble in the air,” sees sky painted “in bruises.” No dialogue, hence no convergence issue; internal texture coherent. Compression in final paragraph accelerates rhythm without syntactic monotony, supporting descent into night-bell duty.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric, rhythmic, and precise—“sapphire viaduct stretched across the dead sea like a prayer made of stone” teaches elevated register early and holds it. Perceptual signature is Mira-specific: she notices condensation rates, bronze alloy, fog drip before sky color. No head-hopping; distance stays close-third. Minor register drift into “cosmic scales had tipped” is brief and motif-earned, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marcus’s perceptual signature—rooftops “like ancient teeth,” bottle label “untouched by decades underwater”—so diction and rhythm reflect his documenter’s precision. No filter-verb clutter; sensory selection (black mirrors, sapphire hue) is POV-colored. Distance remains stable; no head-hop. Sentence rhythm modulates: longer accumulative clauses mirror water retreat, then clipped fragments at the pocketing moment. Clean, purposeful voice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is consistently lyric-scientific: “flame copper sulfate until it sang” marries precision with music. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is alchemical-idiosyncratic. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences under starling flight, short fragment “For when formulas fails” as white space. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. POV stays tightly interior; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual signature—technical diction, tactile precision, vertigo metaphors. No head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under threat; rhythm mirrors altitude breathlessness. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: “Can you be trusted?” tests allegiance, not honesty. Voice remains distinct from corporate or activist clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person texture remains clinical, matching emotional flatline: “voice hollow as the stone chambers.” Syntax lengthens under low gravity, mimicking slowed pulse. Dialogue spare, indirect: Chen’s questions answer themselves through motion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature fixed on sensory minutiae of weightless combat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers close to Mira’s puzzle-logic perception; diction is precise, tactile, quietly lyrical (‘storm-born silence,’ ‘orthogonal approaches’). Rhythm flexes from short declarative beats to longer sinuous lines mirroring the brook’s cadence. No head-hop, no filter overload; voice stays modest yet confident, and the prose teaches its slight elevation early—paid off in the final cosmic shuffle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter (“gleaming like teeth,” “pull-cord handles clinked softly”). Syntax mirrors acoustic obsession—long vibrating sentences for drone, staccato “pull-cord, roar, sing” for attack. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Compression and elision (“three years… macerated more than flesh”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm control is exemplary; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is thick with cold: syntax lengthens and clots during reflective passages, then fractures into single-clause beats under pressure (“She waited one last heartbeat…then stepped”). Perceptual signature is acute—light is drunk, frost is audible, words are “foreign architecture.” No head-hopping; scholar’s dialogue is external only, filtered through guardian perception. Compression in the final paragraph mirrors thaw: sentences shorten, warmth returns to diction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is alchemist-specific—“phoenix ash,” “tears of mercury,” the taste of mercury on his tongue—distinct from generic fantasy diction. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in safety, staccato bursts at the crucible. No filter-verb clutter; sensory access is immediate. Voice never explains what Marcus already knows, preserving immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s perceptual sieve: rungs “singing a different pitch,” gorge mist “lazy spirals.” Syntax lengthens during drift, compresses at fragment flare, mirroring signal intake. No dialogue to distort; narrative diction stays within her technical lexicon yet avoids jargon dump. Voice modulation under pressure is evident in the breathless listless cadence inside the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and internally consistent; diction glides from rusted rails to “cosmic weave” without register drift. Perceptual signature is philosophically inclined—Marcus notices paradoxes and potentialities more than textures. Compression such as “sideways dawn” is taught early and paid off. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue stays elevated but coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrically compressed yet legible; patterned elision (“she understood this better than anyone”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is distinct—walls “breathe,” thread “sings,” geometry “pulse.” Syntax mirrors fever: long cadences suddenly fracture into staccato observations. No dialogue to test naturalism; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Register remains within a metaphysician’s lexicon; no POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is disciplined—she notices pressure gradients, sonar texture, magnetic drag. Prose rhythm breathes with longer accumulative cadences that match the oceanic vastness. Alien speech is distinct whale-crystal diction, cleanly cued. No head-hop or filter-stack; diction stays within her nautical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: syntax lengthens under dread (“petals trembling in the windless air”), then fragments into sprint (“She ran”). Hearing-aid crackle is rendered as onomatopoeic telegraph, not clinical exposition. No head-hop; no filter-verb clot; diction never exceeds her audiologist lexicon. Rhythm accelerates from dirge-beat to heartbeat across paragraphs, tightening pressure without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Diction is compressed, maritime, and tech-tinged (“rebreather hissing,” “fiber-optic veins”). Syntax lengthens underwater, shortens on surfacing, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so voice must carry interiority; it does, though two filter verbs (“she understood”) momentarily soften immediacy. Perceptual signature—sonar pings, amber preservative light—stays consistent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited interiority sustains astronomer’s precise-yet-occult perceptual signature: cosmic metaphors, pulse metrics, ink read as celestial cartography. Rhythm compresses under trial-and-error loops, then elongates into solace cadence at close—mirrors emotional temperature without syntactic monotony. No head-hopping or register drift; vocabulary stays within educated amateur lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext alone and remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric remains locked to the storyteller’s perceptual signature—metallic warmth, lavender crumble, silk on bark—creating a distinct rhythmic pulse. Syntax lengthens and shortens with wind-gust urgency; no head-hopping. Diction (“copper-veined,” “texture-sound”) is coinage born of her body, not ornament. Under peak stress the prose compresses to clause fragments that still scan. Voice modulation supports pressure without losing clarity; one hairline slip—“quietly articulate in seven living languages”—edges toward authorial inventory, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is calm-analytic with faint mythic lift, fitting undercover researcher. Perceptual signature sharp: Marina notices anomalies first, sentiment second. Dialogue minimal but distinct—Thorne’s bitter laugh vs Marina’s clinical brevity. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens as gravity pockets tug bones.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lean, high-density; almost every line advances plot or atmosphere. Rhythm varies—short spikes during phone static, longer calmer expository curls. One template cadence (“The ...”) opens three sentences in 40w stretch; minor. No mixed metaphors; figurative language kept spare. Closure beat is clean of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Lira’s perceptual signature—“notes that shouldn’t exist on regulation strings”—without head-hop. Rhythm swells and contracts with bow pressure; varied sentence lengths mimic musical phrasing. No filter-verb stacks; perception arrives as sensory flare (“stone eyes flickering with confusion”). Diction honors character-bound lexicon—she thinks in lattices, rivets, frequencies, never academic abstraction. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence survives peak intensity without thinning.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited adheres to Ezra; perceptual signature is steady (scanner clicks, bag weight, border dusk). Syntax is controlled, rhythm varies, no head-hop. “Cobalt arcade,” “respectfully rebellious” risk slight writerly flourish yet stay within idiom of a reflective courier. Keeper’s diction converges on storyteller cadence, but the shared hush motif legitimizes the brief overlap.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, anchored in Emil’s carpenter senses: chisel bite, fog weight, wood scent. Diction—“misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” “song only he could hear”—creates a lyric yet tool-specific register that never drifts into abstraction. Rhythm breathes with the elongated chime, sentence lengths swell and contract, mirroring the softening of time. No head-hop, no filter-stack; voice is singular and stays within lexicon of a man who thinks in grain and varnish.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual lens: numbers whispered, frequency only he hears. Syntax is rhythmic, slightly elevated, matching a librarian who thinks in topologies: “equations bloomed into verse.” Occasional compression (“sanely eccentric”) is justified by character repute. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction remains consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Free-indirect voice stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction (“molten copper,” “cipher of longing”) is lyrical yet anchored in her craft. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dawn hush, short beats for choice moment. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Palette-as-prism motif recurs with shifting meaning, taught early and repriced at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filter: “weathered fingers,” “practiced patience,” “locksmith grammar” of tumblers and tension. Syntax lengthens and compresses with vertigo, mirroring her inner ear. No dialogue = no voice-convergence risk. Diction (“matryoshka dolls,” “fiber-optic”) stays within lexicon of a self-taught tradeswoman who has handled museum keys and modern cables. Rhythm modulates: calm catalogue of senses → staccato blood-and-glow release → quiet dawn return.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited is rock-steady; perceptual signature is folklorist’s taxonomic gaze (“cross-referenced it with Gran’s sketches”) and salt-tanged diction. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat; metaphor economy is exact (“mushrooms glowing like moon on water”). Compression and ellipses in the childhood paragraph are pattern-taught early and paid off in the adult return, satisfying the lyric allowance. The prose never drifts into academic register; “phosphorescence,” “constellation maps” stay within Margaret’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter (“rust on iron laugh,” “heel-click” tick); no head-hop. Distinct diction for Kess (“Stop dangling hope like a weapon”) vs. Elara’s archivist cadence. Compression in “three weeks since…” is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate hovers at psychic distance 1–2, mirroring an old woman who thinks in sensory metonyms. Diction stays within pruner lexicon: “apertures,” “succor,” “blessed by use.” Syntax lengthens during weaving, fragments during seed-split—rhythmic control taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature: she sees shimmer before color, angles before emotion. No POV slippage; unreliability is unnecessary—her limits are physical, not perceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lyric third-person voice carries a perceptual signature attuned to texture and ruin—“scarred fingers,” “sleeping serpent,” “jellyfish made of starlight”—without drifting into purple overload. Syntax tightens under labor: short, paratactic clauses mimic stitch-work, then elongates into luminous cadence at the reveal. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is absent, a valid choice that keeps the hush literal; the voice sustains the story’s incantation alone.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marina’s perceptual filter—modified sonar gear, “electromagnetic whispers,” brass verdigris—syntax lengthens under pressure then compresses into staccato ascent clauses. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; the captain’s journal fragments are differentiated by antique diction and frantic ellipsis. Occasional elevated register (“cathedral of trapped atmosphere”) is earned by lyric mode taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Chorus; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“drifting alertness”—filters description toward motion and sound rather than static visual catalog. Syntax flexes with pressure: elongated clauses for mist drift, staccato fragments at lightning strike. No dialogue, so voice distinction criterion is waived; internal diction remains within plausible musician-engineer lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is servant-specific: brass fixtures are “cleaned,” light bulbs “amber,” oilcloth “wrapped” like provisions she knows by touch. Rhythm modulates—short clauses during elevator lurch, longer cadence while decoding tenderness. No head-hop; single POV stays within her lexicon (“rickety cage,” “supple leather”). Free indirect style cleanly fuses “she realized” with raw sensation. Voice never editorializes beyond her plausible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Elena’s perceptual filter: “clouds drift past like thoughts made visible,” “spooled wholeness of it.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under discovery; no filter-verb clusters. Diction remains within her scientific-poetic lexicon; no corporate register drift. Voice is distinct, consistent, and modulates with emotional intensity, meriting high-8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is tactile, synesthetic, and rhythmically controlled (“fractally precise detail,” “mirror the sky inside walls”). Lyra’s perceptual signature—reading faces like braille—remains consistent; no filter-verb drift. Compression such as “whispered debates, turning pages, the scratch of quills” telescopes centuries without breaking immediacy. Only one clause drifts toward lit-speak (“crystalline clarity”), but it’s earned by the hush device.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s perceptual signature—lexicon of cartography, dead languages, mechanical sounds—remains consistent and biased; she sees constellations in rust stains and hears conversation in rigging. Rhythm flexes with pressure: short pulses during light bursts, longer accumulative cadence as patterns emerge. No dialogue means no voice convergence; internal voice stays coherent even at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is crystalline, tactile, frost-bitten: “spires catching the hauntingly bright glow,” “words swam before her eyes”—diction stays within artisan-poet lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, staccato triads for gear-clicks. No dialogue, so no register clash; free indirect thought is consistent. Perceptual signature is particularized (she hears gears sing when wind touches). One tiny lapse: “hauntingly bright” is repeated descriptor; elsewhere brightness is reframed inventively—keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person omniscient floats above the mosaic without head-hopping; diction stays horticultural and restrained. Perceptual signature is communal rather than individuated, fitting the group stake. Bell’s final warmth is a deft sensory flip that rewards earlier ethereal treatment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is textured, synesthetic, and consistent—Marcus “felt the weight of her story flooding through him like electricity through water” fuses physics and emotion in character-unique idiom. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature is quantum-pattern obsessed, noticing nested fractures everywhere. Psychic distance modulates from tight interior (“he touched the fractured cheek”) to cosmic chorus in final paragraph, but the shift is earned via inherited mantle rather than head-hop. Free indirect style is clean, diction stays within Marcus’s elliptical lexicon, and the lyric cadence is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: precise times, tactile walnut, “graceless beauty” of motion. Syntax mirrors her efficiency—lean, tactile, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven (“Follow the light I leave behind”). No head-hop or register drift; even the birds’ gears click through her ears. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter clauses as frost approaches, sustaining rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate sustains chemist-perceptual signature (“polymerized into distance,” “structural color”); rhythmic control mirrors musical cadence; no head-hopping; diction stays within educated but maternal lexicon; foam imagery repetition is pattern-taught and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close hovers at poetic distance; diction glass-bright, rhythmic—“tinkled overhead,” “cloud-light from below.” Filter verbs minimal; perception skewed through Merrick’s cataloguing gaze. No dialogue contamination; child’s speech terse, believable. Compression taught early—“Clean Slates, Blank Pages, Virgin Thoughts”—paid off in final shelf swap. Occasional cadence repetition (“glass apples,” “glass branches”) reads deliberate motif rather than template.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is synesthetic, desert-worn, rhythmically controlled (“brittle on the surface, flexible at the core” enacts its own meaning). Perceptual signature is consistent—she maps epochs onto taste buds, constellations onto brine—without ever slipping into explanatory filler. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; lyric elision (“hours passed, or perhaps minutes”) is pattern-taught and paid off in temporal vertigo.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays tight to Marta’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinct choral diction—“counterpoint,” “time signatures in the air”—matches her profession. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ascent, staccato for the first responses. No filter-verb clutter; metaphors stay physical (elevator as vocal cord). Dialogue is absent by design and the prose carries subtext successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays locked to Vera; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is engineer-helix: cracks read as “neural pathways,” moonlight as “silver spirals.” Syntax elongates under drug reverie, contracts during tremor—rhythmic control serves pressure. No dialogue to judge; free-indirect cleanly fused. Purposeful elision (“years studying”) is taught early and paid off at carry-out.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close stays consistently inside Orin’s perceptual filter: “prism-minded,” “clandestinely luminous,” “threshold effects”—diction belongs to an archivist, not encyclopedia. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for scholarship, staccato motion beats during inversion. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One register wobble: “metastasize” feels clinical against the abbey mystique, but isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person limited holds tight psychic distance; diction (“symphonically minded,” “acoustic architecture”) is character-bound, not authorial flourish. Rhythmic mimicry of musical phrasing—anaphora of “Then another, harmonizing”—mirrors Mira’s cadence under trance. No head-hop; the hedgehog’s “smile” is external observation, not interior claim. Filter verbs serve voice: “she could feel the siskins returning” keeps the vibration inside her bones.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Viktor’s perceptual signature—magnetic fields before color, chess geometry before social noise. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, staccato for piece moves. No head-hopping; Mira’s interior is implied through gesture. One clause (“thoughtfully precise arrogance”) momentarily lifts into editorial diction, but recedes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara’s sensorium: star-coins on tin, lavender and gunpowder scent, the tremor of leather under pulse. Rhythm mirrors tuning act—long voweled sentences for sweep, staccato fragments for clicks. No head-hops. Lexicon (“amplitude,” “ceasefire,” “transmitter”) is justified by her radio-builder expertise. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood suddenly”) is permissible at epiphany; it is paid off by immediate physical reaction. Voice is distinctive, but a single overwritten line (“theatrical sincerity of new beginnings”) dips below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice carries a hush-mist cadence that modulates under pressure: short percussive clauses during shoot emergence, elongated sway-sentences at bloom. Perceptual signature is smell-first, paint-palette precise: “putrid-sweet promise” is both accurate and character-bound. No dialogue, so no register-clash risk. Single POV remains stable; no head-hop. The faint template-cadence in “She watered it with dew…when the world balanced…” is the lone hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited keeps steady distance; perceptual signature is pilot-technical—“checking chronometer,” “reading currents,” “calling coordinates.” Syntax tightens under inversion: “Gravity flipped.” No head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing,” “orbital groves”—slightly overshoots Kessa’s likely lexicon but stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya with controlled psychic distance; vocabulary of flight procedures feels authentic without jargon dump. Rhythm flexes: longer reflective sentences for theory, clipped fragments when instruments scream, mirroring cognitive tempo. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature—she notes coins scattered, container serial numbers, wind vector math—separates her from generic narrator. Dialogue absent by design; prose compensates with scientific subtextual urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Lyrian’s synesthetic perception; every metaphor is filtered through her cross-wired senses (“tasted as cinnamon and seen as spiraling geometry”). Rhythm swells from hushed sibilants to crescendo of liquid light, mirroring the symphony’s arc. No head-hopping; even global reactions are rendered as colors she would hear. Distinctive syntactic layering—“sound-color-symphony”—teaches the reader the fused sensorium and pays off in the final sky-drenched chord.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate locks to Kessa’s perceptual signature—sound swallowed, gold threads seen peripherally, silence as presence. Syntax mirrors mounting pressure: longer sentences while climbing, clipped fragments during the weave. No dialogue appears, so naturalism tests are waived. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“gauze,” “baton,” “braiding”) and avoids academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “celestial erasure,” “square root of abandonment,” “color of forgetting” all belong to Mira’s numerically haunted lexicon. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure—short staccato clauses mimic press clicks, then expand into the final sweeping realization. No filter-verb stacks; compression (“lucid turbulence”) is taught early and paid off. Voice never cracks into generic lyricism; every metaphor is tethered to ink, plates, or stars.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new information (star count, ink color, personality count). Metaphors are coherent—mathematics of emotion never contradicts typography of absence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges refracted light. Density is extreme yet propulsive; no line could be cut without losing knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“dragonfly-wing”, “gossamer robes”) mirrors her artifact-trained eye. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during Convergence, then lengthens at dawn—intention cadence shift. No head-hopping; knowledge bounds respected.

    Third-person limited keeps consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors tactile and optical detail congruent with a mystic. Syntax flexes from lyric (“crystallized breath”) to precise (“electromagnetic fluctuations”), miricking pressure shifts. No dialogue, so voice remains uncontaminated. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she felt,” “she saw”) inside a sensual epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient is kept at a lyric distance that never leaks into head-hopping; the camera stays tight to Mei’s sensorium. Diction—“raveling,” “stoically sparkling,” “threaded words through space”—is consistent, compressed, and patterned; the slight archaic tilt justifies the family-myth tone. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness is evaluated solely through narrative texture, which passes: each clause adds density without syntactic monotony. The final sentence’s cadence break (“feels, inexplicably, the urge”) is an intentional modulation, not drift.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Kira’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Diction remains inside her sensory lexicon—“probability streams,” “quantum foam”—without drifting into faux-technical jargon. Rhythm accelerates into fragments during jumps (“Another redirect. The bay underwater...”) then lengthens for the maternal confrontation, mirroring emotional tempo. Mother’s one line carries harmonic overtones, a brief convergence that reads intentional rather than voice-slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elsa’s perceptual orbit; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens during ascent to mimic breath, then tightens at the reveal.

Minor cadence loops (“laugh...laughter...laughing”) are pattern-driven, not artifact, and serve the standing-wave climax.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is dye-master synesthesia—colors whisper origins. Syntax mirrors bodily unfamiliarity: “unfamiliar rhythms” juxtaposed with deliberate climb. No dialogue, so indirection & tag tests N/A. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs serve voice (“he saw not just colors but narratives”).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Marcus’s perceptual register: grease under nails, moonlight as analgesic, mirror glints as syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception: “scattered pearls from a broken necklace.” Filter verbs are minimal; syntax grows paratactic under song-crescendo, mirroring breathless choir.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Ezra’s perceptual filters: selective attention to paper creases, breath-counting to manage empathy surge. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses when he expands calm, fragments during sensory overload. No head-hop. Diction stays within a reclusive autodidact’s lexicon; “enlarged tranquility” is the one coined phrase but is patterned and paid off. Dialogue minimal, indirection successful.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric-accumulative voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: “shadows that fell upward on certain afternoons.” Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses for wonder, abrupt fragments for recognition.

Diction—“cataloguing,” “luminous frequency,” “preservation satchel”—is shaped by three centuries of occupational obsession. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She moved faster now, ice cracking beneath her feet” propels. The only POV drift is the half-sentence explanation of the founder’s intent, but it is brief and immediately re-anchored in Elara’s gasp, so distance control remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coastal-noir diction—“truce of hush,” “skeleton hosting darker trades”—remains inside Mae’s ken without forced lyricism. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for stealth, staccato beats at reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: metallic taste = magnetic direction, never decluttered into generic sensation.

Compression taught early (“tasting the future through metal’s molecular memory”) pays off in final fog flavor “questions and quantum uncertainty.” No head-hopping; Simon’s dialogue stays spare and winter-cold, distinct from Marina’s mineral lexicon. Register stable—scientific diction belongs to her POV, never drifts into corporate filler.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under task—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No dialogue, so voice convergence issues are moot. Filter verbs are few and motivated. One hairline slip: “glististen” neologism could read as typo, but pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distilled perceptual signature: optical sensors register fear-colors no human eye could see.

Syntax lengthens with academic precision then shortens under emotional surge (“Teach me”). Dialogue idiom distinct: Marcus’s gentle interrogation vs Elara’s lecturer cadence. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor stack (“meteor trails…silver threads…void of understanding”) is patterned early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is material-scientific (“calcium carbonate lattices,” “metadata of extracted experiences”). Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fragments at the dig: “dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars.” No head-hopping; shell’s hum is externalized sensation, not omniscient intrusion.

    <question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
    <comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, create natural breath; no template cadence runs. Occasional elevated diction (“pulsing stillness,” “ineffable rising”) borders on poetic overlay but stays justified by Maya’s lyrical vocation. One paraphrase loop: “sunlight filled the space like an anthem” mirrors earlier “sunlight…like an anthem” without fresh increment, a −0.2.

Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays snug to Kira’s technician-lyric perceptual filter: “emerald and jade” color coding, interval timing of drips, server-rack nomenclature. Syntax breathes—long aerial sentence for hush, clipped clause to silence phone—mirrors tension release. No dialogue contamination; Marcus’ two lines carry subtext of unearned apology. Only nit: “protected vulnerability” is named conceptually twice; trimming one would keep pressure inside gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: locksmith’s diction of tumblers, springs, calibrations; syntax coils and releases like the mechanism she studies.

Minor template cadence in “She would... she would...” futures near end nudges it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lyrical third-person tight to Aldric sustains a controlled psychic distance: we get inference (“hypothesizing about the nature of creation”) rather than textbook certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person POV locked to Marcus; perceptual signature—bitter erudition, marine decay imagery, mechanical precision—stays distinct. Syntax tightens under pressure: shorter clauses when journal is offered. No filter-verb clutter. Dialogue indirection works: woman’s “We know” lands as silent admission of institutional complicity. Voice modulates from sneering contempt to guarded alliance without losing abrasive core.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient remains stable, filtering perception through Chen’s musician ear: “braiding diverse voices,” “carpet of traveled stillness.” Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—modes, rosette, pentatonic—without academic inflation. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: long sentences for drone-like exposition, shorter fragments at the gift beat. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” appears twice in identical phrasing, a template echo that nudges this below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person selective stays anchored to Mira’s perceptual signature—synaptic-tasting air, pruning as culinary gesture. Diction (“knowledge fruit seed,” “neural garden”) coins without jarring; rhythm breathes with seed growth beats. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal metaphor control, which holds. Minor template cadence in “memories are like…” line, but forgivable at cadence peak.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice is textured: "nectar-sweet evening air", "broken promises" feels like her poetic idiom, not writerly flourish.

Perceptual signature distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Marina’s synesthetic attention—streetlights “daydream,” silence “blazes”—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens then compresses with her pulse, climaxing in two blunt clauses: “She placed the shard… Marina walked home.” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she sees time as lateral drift and scent as crystallized epoch.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly focalized through Thessaly’s mineral patience, then Marina’s bubbling regulator; no head-hop. Diction is compressed and marine-tinged (“coral-crusted,” “telepathic tentacles”) without purple swell. Rhythm accelerates during memory cascade—clause-stacked revelations mimic dominoes—then exhales into the final crystalline line. Filter verbs appear only where they serve telepathic distance (“felt a human mind”), not as habit.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person tight adheres to Marcus’s mathematically tinged perception; diction like “architectural certainty” and “recursive loops” stays within his lexicon. Rhythm mirrors pulse: long cumulative sentences for ascent, staccato roll-clauses for dice beats. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; immediacy is maintained. The voice never editorializes beyond what a driven architect might privately calculate.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays anchored in Mira’s perceptual filter: “she could almost taste clean air,” “paint-stained hands.” Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during brushwork, longer cadences for online replies.

Single POV so no voice convergence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is precise, tool-oriented, slightly melancholy. Syntax mirrors her mechanical mind: clauses stack like gear trains, then fracture into short bursts under stress (“Light exploded outward”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Register remains consistent; “dying breath,” “latent radiance” fit her literate but solitary diction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited adheres to Mara’s sensorium; perceptual signature skews toward tactile and olfactory extremes. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She’d died here once—technically died—” mimics resuscitation jolt.

Final paragraph cadence slows, mirroring her measured exit.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: salt-kissed branches, cloud-script read as sheet music, mallet warmed by submarine memory. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short staccato sentences during strike-flurries, then longer lyrical cadences as harmonics become visible light lines. No head-hop, no register drift; lyric compression is pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices archival codes, not ambient sounds. Syntax tilts toward analytical cadence (“compare them to the Succession Crisis”) fitting an academic mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited voice maintains surveyor idiom—"interlaced absence," "angle of subsidence"—syntax stays clipped, metric like a field book. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as water rises. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on internal diction; succeeds. Perceptual signature consistent—he notices subsidence before splendor.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: every noun choice is filtered through a librarian’s lexicon (“vacuum-sealed,” “spine resonance,” “call-number hush”). Rhythm modulates with task urgency—longer sentences during cataloguing, clipped fragments when generators threaten. No head-hopping; compression (“she had minutes”) is taught early and paid off. Voice stays in plausible diction except one academic blip—“conceptual repricing” notion intrudes, but it’s internal, not narrated.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering perception through Mei’s glass-worker eye: “memories of her daughter’s laughter” is a precise occupational metaphor. Lyric compression (“luminous torment”) is pattern-taught and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on rhythmic recurrence of “fold,” “polish,” “ascend,” which modulate under pressure without drum-beat monotony. Diction remains within artisan lexicon; only “shadow-plague” edges toward abstract coinage.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Amira’s physicist ear: “perturbation readings,” “probability clouds.” Syntax accelerates under countdown: short declaratives mimic heart-rate.

No head-hopping or register drift; compass and flask function as extensions of POV memory.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Marcus’s sensory filter; diction—“alien light,” “delicately robust”—bears his stunned, medicated awe. Rhythm elongates then compresses: long sentences for descent, staccato exchange in cave. No head-hop; the woman’s interior is unknowable, preserving mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is dense, synesthetic, and consistent: "onyx-ink," "silver grass that chimed," "air tasting of lilacs and lightning." Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for awe, fragment bursts ("The crack began to glow.") for pivot beats. No head-hop; psychic distance stays tight to Elara. Patterned elision ("pouring nothing into nothing") teaches itself early and pays off in the empty-cup closure image. Dialogue, though brief, carries indirection and generational lilt that separates spectral mother from living daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains coherent perceptual signature: Mei notices weight, shimmer, stitch-tension. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, clipped fragments at breach. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived. Diction stays within a monk-raised adolescent’s plausible lexicon; only “conceptual repricing” phrase edges abstract, but it occurs in closing reflection where slight elevation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person omniscient stays disciplined to Thorne’s sensory filter: weathered fingers, familiarity with every stone, selective attention to shadow-less gnomon. Syntax tightens under stealth—short, verb-forward clauses—then widens for the conceptual payoff. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (“The blackout was your doing” spoken as recognition, not accusation). One template cadence run (“Thorne…, Amara…”) mid-scene is the lone rhythm artifact; it does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person narration keeps a tight psychic distance that never exceeds Yann’s sensory field. Syntax is controlled: long sentences for spiraling eel-motion, fragment-like bursts for precognitive hits (“three heartbeats forward”). Diction stays within a herder’s lexicon—no academic intrusion.

Distinct rhythmic signature in parallel openings (“If knowledge…then wisdom…”) that mimic fencing cadence. Compression and elision taught early (“angles were eloquent”) and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to October’s perceptual filter: moonlight as “liquid silver,” anthology as “proof,” tin surface “luminous fractures.” Syntax lengthens during calm collation, then compresses into single-clause beats at train-whistle intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature—“seismographs of laughter,” “tongue that tasted of cinnamon.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long, corridor-walking sentences in dream-state collapse into terse ledger diction at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices patterns (key sequences), textures (brittle seedpods), and hidden purposes (prize displays as camouflage). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during chain-breaking, expands lyrically at dawn. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls.
