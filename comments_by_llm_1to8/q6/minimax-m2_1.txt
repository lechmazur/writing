  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "patient waiting for the precise moment when resistance became flow," "learning the geography... with the same patience she had once applied to her glass." Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Elision is purposeful (the fire, the escape) and paid off in reflection. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. The prose reflects Mira's glasswork sensibility consistently, and no dialogue appears to evaluate. Minor deduction for slight elevation in the final paragraph ("the expression felt like light breaking through glass") that edges toward poetic summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: movement as language, thermal sensor as divining rod, touch-worn brass. Diction ("capsize survivor," "unshaken marvels," "rectify the great loss") occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits at the edge of her established idiom but remains legible. No dialogue is present. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("she realized now that she had succeeded—not by recreating sound, but by learning to hear with different senses") edges toward helpful-narrator mode, slightly flattening the voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: "a man who had spent thirty years helping the departed find their way to whatever came next" establishes Aldric's measured, professional cadence. The prose modulates effectively under pressure ("translucent and confused, their memories tangled with salt and storm"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. One minor slip: "bubble-doubled" is a creative coinage that slightly disrupts the established register without clear voice motivation. Dialogue ("I'm here") is minimal but apt. The perceptual signature—seeing through an undertaker's lens—shapes what is noticed and valued throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and carries a distinct texture ("the particular grief of proximity, how cruelty often lives next door to compassion"). Perceptual signature is present—Mira notices community need, tactical details of food runs, the symbolic weight of objects. Two minor slips: "amplified quiet" as a repeated phrase feels slightly forced, and "the simple accumulation of whispered requests" leans toward tell rather than showing the requests themselves. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mei notices through a spiritual-artistic filter ("fireflies rose like the thoughts of earth itself"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the memory breakthrough and widening for the landscape. Diction stays consistent, though elevated phrasing ("gossamer," "liquid pearl," "marrow") occasionally risks overwriting. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. The voice is cohesive and the elision of mechanics (how camera obscura captures feeling) is purposeful, supporting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("mirage," "hyperbolic geometry," "fibrous moments"), creating a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Elara's professional lens as a maze designer. However, register occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("arguments about how human consciousness might move through time itself") that flattens immediacy. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose modulates well from meditative opening to the charged final image of the humming fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance is stable and apt for a reflective, patient protagonist. Diction fits Mira's educated, strategic mind: "catechism of resilience," "green scent of dormant potential." Some phrases edge toward elevated register—"staggering grace," "wild diversity of adaptation"—but remain voice-consistent. No head-hopping. The final paragraph's "keeper of futures" risks thematic echo, yet it reads as Mira's internal reframe rather than author intrusion. Rhythm modulates appropriately between observation and tactical planning.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: colors-as-sounds, absences-as-data, and the measured diction of an engineer observing emotion through technical lenses. Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose modulates appropriately under reflective pressure. The piece skews heavily toward interiority and backstory, yet each reflection anchors in present stimuli (aurora, forge, greenhouse) and the voice never head-hops or loses focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("luminous disbelief," "jar of captured moonbeams," "bruised amber and soft viridian"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and diction is controlled. However, the prose leans toward elevated, poetic register throughout without modulation for pressure; peak moments (the photograph, the man's departure) receive the same ornate treatment as exposition, flattening urgency. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression is present but risks opacity without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; the glassblower's perceptual signature filters detail through craft knowledge and philosophical reflection. The theatrical solemnity of his spoken announcement ("Now then…") is voice-motivated and distinct. However, diction in interiority ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness," "cautiously beating heart") drifts into elevated, label-heavy register that reads generic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose at peak beats leans on abstract phrasing instead of embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—stunt-performer lens colors descriptions ("coordinated punch to the chest")—and the prose modulates with emotional intensity ("her phobia clawing at her throat"). However, diction slips into elevated register at peak beats: "riddling compulsion," "surgical precision," "honeyed condescension of a puppeteer," "transformation from guardian to captor" feel writerly rather than character-particular under crisis stress. Daniel's single line of dialogue ("You were never supposed to remember...") carries subtext but arrives late and alone, offering no rhythm test for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "topology of shadow") that coheres as voice but approaches uniformity—nearly every sentence deploys figurative language without variation in pressure. Psychic distance is controlled. The oracle's perceptual signature (obsession with horizon, reading stones) is established but does not modulate under stress; her interior texture remains smooth throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The robot POV is stable and carries a distinct perceptual signature: processing threads, categorization instability, circuit-level sensation. Psychic distance is controlled; the vocabulary blends technical precision with philosophical reach in a voice-consistent way. The prose modulates well under pressure ("the question that burns in every circuit"). Minor register drift: "mundane mysticism the specialists mentioned" and "remarkable composure" occasionally read as external observer language rather than pure robot interiority, though the frame (Second Chance Program specialists) provides some alibi.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV first-person with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices glass surfaces, smudges, refractions, and the ambiguity of clarity—consistent with the registrar role and grandfather's legacy. Diction stays within the narrator's contemplative, slightly elevated lexicon without jarring shifts. No dialogue on the page; communication occurs through doodles and gesture, maintaining voice coherence. POV modesty holds: the narrator infers Mira's intent from drawings and touch without claiming unearned certainty. However, some constructions lean toward committee voice ("those who once filled these halls found other work") and register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("clarity sometimes requires mediation") that flattens immediacy during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a distinct texture: "stubborn patience," "wisely pragmatic," "sweet decay of autumn's first fallen leaves." Diction remains consistent with an older, experienced gardener's lexicon. Perceptual signature is character-specific (focus on cracks, soil, texture). Some repeated syntactic stems appear ("Elara had...," "She [verb]..."), but they do not constitute heavy template cadence. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent, blending technical detail ("temporal vectors," "quantum states") with poetic phrasing ("pages of a book being read in slow motion"). Kira's perceptual signature—mechanic's touch, patient observation—remains stable, and ARIA's single line carries appropriate coolness. However, register occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("beautiful, impossible multiplicity") that reads more as narrator flourish than Kira's particular idiom under pressure. No head-hopping; POV control is clean throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (musician's vocabulary: "liminal hollow," "intervals," "vibration and resonance"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to slightly elevated reflection in the final paragraph. Some diction edges toward elevated register not strictly character-bound ("testimony of vibration," "transmission, connection") but remains mostly coherent. No dialogue present; internal voice is consistent and idiomatically Elena's throughout, though it leans poetic rather than grounded under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; Mira's perceptual signature (peripherally aware, drawn to edges and smudges) colors every observation. Diction remains in register: "chittering" instruments, "pale grief" aurora, "swaying in her like a damaged antenna" all feel voice-particular. The prose modulates under pressure—short clauses when she touches the smudge, longer accumulative rhythm in the final paragraph. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "fault tolerance as an oracle—that was what the administration called it" reads slightly expository, though it quickly returns to dream imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (urban explorer filtering sensory detail through skepticism and documentary habits). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("religiously skeptical," "drowsy alertness," "familiar electricity in his chest"). No dialogue is present. The prose modulates purposefully with emotional intensity, tightening at the closure beat. One minor slip: "the weight of a confession itself" edges toward authorial summary rather than Marcus's particular idiom, though it does not break the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature: "vines threaded," "small ecosystems," "breathing thing." Diction is controlled and purposeful, syntax varies ("Along the river… there existed"; "To reach… the keeper did not walk"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak moments ("methodical grace," "the settling of things that had held tension"), and the POV maintains perfect certainty ("had never been," "had learned") without inference or doubt, violating modesty calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is controlled and distinct, with elevated diction ("liminal space," "cautious exuberance") that fits Elara's reflective professional lens. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the patient, nurturing work of helping spirits remain open") that reads more like authorial commentary than character-specific perception. The perceptual signature is present but leans toward uniform lyricism rather than idiosyncratic texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—"frequencies beyond the range of normal perception," noticing "shadows that crawled instead of fell"—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("displaced axis," "bronze quiet," "atmosphere that surrounded everything he did") but reads as deliberate stylization rather than register mismatch. Free indirect style is clean: "Perhaps, Elias thought, there were still dreams enough in stories to begin again" blends narration and interiority without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately—compressed in the opening exposition, then slowing for the diary discovery and final contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elias's espionage background ("the spaces between words," "patterns the way he understood tides"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in phrases like "after last orders had become first orders of a different kind." Psychic distance modulates effectively across reflective and present-action beats. The prose carries a particular texture in syntax and rhythm. Minor filter-verb density ("he wondered," "he understood") in the final paragraph slightly dulls immediacy but remains within voice bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Matthias filters environment through his scholarly lens ("Scholastics and the Desert Fathers") and ritual precision. Diction is controlled and character-specific ("dimensional anchor," "muffled clarity"). Compression is purposeful; the looping structure mirrors the loop pedal motif. Psychic distance modulates effectively from clinical observation ("not in pain...but in frustration") to immersive ritual absorption. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "light that existed somewhere behind her eyes," "mathematics of time folded into something organic." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interior, then lyric zoom to mirrored horizon). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("logarithmic curve," "temporal displacement syndrome") that edges away from embodied perception, though it remains legible. No dialogue present. Elision of the council and exhaustion mechanics is purposeful compression that supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; focalization through Mira's perceptual signature (gravity-defying posture, tablet-reading, time-fracture awareness) is consistent. Diction is elevated and metaphorically dense ("darkening brightness," "periodically eternal," "procedurally generated routes"), which fits the lyric-philosophical mode but borders on over-ornamentation in peak moments without grounding in concrete action. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph shifts into future-tense assertion ("The ripple would come... she would be the one") that reads as narrator confidence rather than Mira's situated inference, creating a mild filter leak.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters sensory detail through Maren's deaf experience with specificity: "audibly muted," "visible music" in autumn leaves. Prose rhythm modulates appropriately, slowing in the cavern's timeless space. Weakness: "architecture of her silenced world" and "filament of hush" recur as elegant phrases but edge toward writerly self-awareness rather than character-particular perception. The phrase "隔离" (Chinese for "isolate") appears untranslated in the penultimate paragraph, disrupting lexical coherence and readability—likely a typographical artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate crisis ("nurture integrity in solitude," "men who valued profit over integrity"). The voice is competent but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elena's meteorological expertise should shape how she reads atmospheric and social pressure, but her observations remain generic. Filter verbs ("understood," "realized") appear frequently in key beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent and layered with philosophical texture ("like watching a child attempt to describe color to someone who had only ever known sound"). Psychic distance and POV are stable; no head-hopping. The prose occasionally slips into elevated register ("ethically playful part," "accumulated layers of chalk and dust and intention") that feels slightly explanatory rather than embodied in peak moments, but the perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, liminal awareness) remains distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "chronic hush," "echo-harbor violinist," "skeleton of iron and stubbornness" all carry a specific, lyric register. POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent—Marina hears "what others missed in the spaces between sounds." Diction remains within her sensibility; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: the first note is "raw and searching," then the music "accumulated, building something from nothing." Rhythmic control under pressure is strong; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera's professional vocabulary ("compound," "olfactory channels," "fusion of her analytical insight"), her method of reading static electricity, and her self-aware reflections create a coherent voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooms into sensory immersion during the scent beat, pulls back for professional assessment. One weakness: the final third drifts toward explanatory interiority ("she understood at last that her half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest") that slightly over-articulates what the scene already shows, and "professionally thorough" recurs as a tic four times without fresh angle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Maren; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated literary register ("whimsically attentive," "indefinable that made her feel both small and strangely seen") that remains consistent under the contemplative pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present (Elias's explanation of the locket). However, diction occasionally drifts toward writerly phrasing ("the cycles of compassion turned quietly in her mind") that reads more authorial than character-particular, and the perceptual signature—while grounded in sensory detail—does not sharply differentiate Maren's noticing under stress from calm observation. Psychic distance is controlled but lacks modulation tied to escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable throughout; perceptual signature is character-particular (notice how Yara reads the orchard's brilliance as something that "hurt somehow" and filters the crater through her fen-village past). Diction remains consistent—"hollow promise," "geometric shadows," "luminescent ache"—with purposeful elevation that matches her sculptural vocation without drifting into unmotivated register. The arbor reflection sequence maintains clean focalization: "she understood" and "She had tried" anchor realization in present perception rather than omniscient summary. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Rhythm modulates effectively from the contemplative opening to the urgent climb back, and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the arbor scene.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with perceptual signature tied to Sera's profession (illustration case, finest brushes, graphite blade, documenting in sketchbook). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, favoring concrete nouns. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the journey, slightly pulled back at closure). The piece enters the 7-band for clean execution; it does not reach 8+ because the voice, while competent, lacks a distinct rhythmic signature or syntactic compression that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-limited is stable and controlled. Diction is elevated and internally consistent, though at peak moments (pressing the eyes, the final walk) the register risks uniformity—long, clause-heavy sentences without the compression or fragmentation stress might cause. The perceptual signature is present: she notices patterns, fractures, dovetailing. However, the voice does not modulate meaningfully with emotional intensity; the rhythm remains lyric-meditative throughout. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent but does not shift to heighten the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (vibration reading, airflow whispers, infrastructure language as braille) is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a maintenance worker's immediate perception: "liminal and holy," "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment," "colonized its substance," "cascade of sense memory not her own." The phrase "not遗言 but a message" includes an untranslated character that breaks voice and reads as generation artifact. Psychic distance collapses at closure when narration asserts off-page events ("somewhere above, a student...finds the answer") without Maren's causal knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean; perceptual signature is character-specific (scientific cataloging, root-system analogies). Diction remains consistent with Vera's professional lens; the heightened register in "circuitously sincere" and "mossy trellis after rain" reads voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the phone call pursues a goal (connection) through indirection. One minor register slip: "metamorphosis" in the opening feels slightly elevated for sustained interiority, though it fits the plant-science frame. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds steady; Mira's perceptual signature (seeing colors she can't name, drinking in transformations) is consistent and voice-particular. Diction occasionally spikes into elevated register ("wry defiance of entropy," "haggard awe") that feels writerly rather than character-filtered under extreme fatigue. Dialogue is sparse and functional; the stranger's lines carry purpose without subtext depth.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout; psychic distance is controlled and appropriately close during the pearls revelation. Voice carries distinct texture—"a man who believed the future was a country he had already visited," "the way one notices breathing without questioning its mechanism"—with vocabulary that fits an educated, reflective focalizer. Perceptual signature is consistent: Varen notices "everything else" while missing the pilgrim's disturbance, a blindness rooted in his pride. Filter verbs ("seemed," "appeared") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. One minor slip: "small奇迹" appears to be a copy artifact (Chinese character for "miracle"), breaking immersion mid-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a distinctive perceptual signature: the archivist notices through the lens of preservation and vision (salt crystals, corroded brass, fragments). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during vision sequences, slightly wider during exposition of his reputation. The phrase "reactively visionary" in exposition reads slightly promotional but does not break voice. Sera's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narrator occasionally drifts into expository summary ("She understood then…"). Perceptual signature is present—route-mapper's eye catalogs cracks—but the voice lacks rhythmic variety and leans on stock poetic constructions ("breath released from ancient lungs," "holes punched through velvet"). Dialogue is absent. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the confession), diction remains elevated and abstract rather than compressing into Aria's particular idiom. No major filter-verb stacks, but the texture is more committee-lyric than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance; Mira's perceptual signature (scientific precision, controlled doubt) is distinct. Diction stays within her register throughout. The prose modulates well from clinical observation to lyric accumulation as pressure builds ("a choir of voices singing in unison"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The voice is purposeful and controlled, though some elevated phrasing ("prayers offered to an indifferent universe") occasionally feels authored rather than character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Narrative distance is stable third-person limited. Perceptual signature exists in the elevated, philosophical register, though it remains consistent rather than character-particular. The prose modulates appropriately with the storm's intensification. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the precise instant when connection became absence") that feels more like authorial commentary than Elian's embodied perception under pressure. The Chinese character "永恒" (eternity) appears unexplained, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elena; perceptual signature is distinct (reading people "like ledgers," precision, analytical). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"deathly vitality," "liquefies rigid thinking"—that feels authorial rather than Elena's voice under pressure, though it stays broadly consistent. Darius has no dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose modulates well across reflection and scene, and free indirect access to Elena's calculating mind is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; perceptual signature is strong (Elara notices frequencies, textures, the tremor in glass). Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful compression ("component lies and truths," "glowing restraint"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates naturally from sensory observation to reflection. However, runs of similar syntactic openings ("She had inherited," "She believed," "She did not invent") and the repeated "earnest studious pursuit" phrase create mild template cadence in the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct lyric register ("something without a name lived in the space between rhythm and rust"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature—collecting fragments, filtering reality through accumulated stories—is specific. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the quiet detritus of human speech") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted, and the dockworker's dialogue is paraphrased rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable and voice-motivated. Diction fits Elena's intellectual register ("methodical precision," "demystification," "theatrical trappings"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters through her professional lens ("expecting another straightforward explanation"). No head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("the compass of human connection pointed...inward, toward the ephemeral moments") where simpler embodiment would sharpen impact. The Russian word "убегая от" (running from) in the penultimate paragraph is unexplained and breaks the established English narrative frame without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV, stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices patterns, maps displacement, catalogs faces—all aligned with her "orderly intuitive" trait. The narration stays within her knowledge and the diction fits her cultural fluency ("perpetual carnival," "Flotilla District," "foundation stone chip"). No head-hopping. The phrase "orderly intuitive rhythm" in paragraph two edges toward diagnostic labeling but is anchored in observable action (cataloging, noting, mapping). Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature is consistent (professional precision, methodical observation). Diction matches her reflective, technically informed voice. No dialogue to assess. The phrase "dawning hush…breaking into the sharp, clear silence of day" demonstrates rhythmic control. Minor slip: "humanity's most distant witness" in the final paragraph shifts into elevated register that reads slightly authorial rather than Mira's internal idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt for Elias's sensory focus. Perceptual signature is strong—he "learned to see through touch," reads light refraction, feels air shift—but diction sometimes drifts into elevated register ("liminal space," "magnetic in the misty silence") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression in describing the repair process serves the accumulative design, though the final paragraph's summarizing voice steps outside the earlier texture.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is clean and stable; diction matches Miriam's expertise (hydrographic, convergent watersheds, temperature differentials). Perceptual signature is strong—she reads condensation patterns, falcon behavior, and map discrepancies through an atlas editor's lens. The prose has distinct texture in clause rhythm and technical specificity. The final sentence's elevated phrasing ("the particular silence of a discovery about to be made") fits voice but edges toward abstraction under peak anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; perceptual signature is consistent (professional attention to vibration, resonance, rhythm). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "system of resonance," "sympathetic vibrations," "tuning peg." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Under peak moments (cobblestones beginning to respond), the prose maintains its measured, technical texture without collapsing into generic excitement. Psychic distance is consistent; the narrator's certainty matches Eliorn's expertise without unwarranted leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight interiority during the vial decision, then expansive as memories flood. Perceptual signature is present in Marina's focus on the vial's warmth and the temple's hush. Diction is elevated ("gathered hush," "lonesome and splendid") and voice-consistent, though "羲悬" (extraneous character after Marina's name in the opening) appears to be a typographical artifact. Under peak stress, the prose maintains lyric texture without collapsing into fragments, supporting the Accumulative lens. However, "unsnarl the final tangle of gears" introduces a verb ("unsnarl") that feels slightly incongruous with the surrounding register, and the shift from panic to serenity lacks embodied compression.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated, lyric register ("membrane between what was and what might have been," "clarity, the pure copperlight repose"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature—Marcus filtering setting through inherited grief and purpose—is distinct. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract or portentous phrasing that feels imposed rather than organic to a protagonist under immediate pressure. No dialogue beyond the keeper's offstage hearing, so subtext and voice distinction cannot be assessed. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately, though some constructions ("he was threading a labyrinth with his own story") lean ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elara; psychic distance is stable and appropriately elevated for a ghost bride's centuries-spanning perception. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated (luminous coffin, smoke refusing to rise, winter-cracked fields), with elevated register fitting the spectral, alchemical frame. One slip: "婚礼头纱" (Chinese characters for "wedding veil") appears mid-sentence, breaking linguistic consistency without setup or payoff—a register/idiom mismatch that pulls the reader out (−0.4). Free indirect style is clean when shifting briefly to the gardener's experience ("eyes that remembered loss"). No head-hopping; the gardener's interiority is accessed only through externalized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Maren notices stone, water, thread, light) and voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with her "poetic" identity. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock phrases ("the ghosts of precedent broken by drought," "path-stitching, where weavers would literally sew routes") and summary-mode narration ("This was her gift and her burden"). Psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose: some beats offer close sensory detail, others zoom out to tell us about her reputation or the canyon's acceptance. Filter verbs ("She understood now," "She had never seen") stack in reflective passages. The prose remains legible and voice-motivated throughout, but lacks the precise rhythmic control and perceptual specificity that would elevate it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices archaeological particulars: runes, bronze tools, woven shrouds). Diction stays within her plausible register, though "the cautious enchantment of someone who has stumbled into a story she did not know she was part of" reads slightly elevated for mid-excavation fatigue. The prose modulates effectively with pressure: short, concrete sentences during the birthmark discovery, longer rhythms in the reflective final night. One weak spot: "静脉" (Chinese for "veins") appears untranslated in the first paragraph, an artifact that momentarily breaks immersion and suggests inadvertent code-switching or generation error.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated lyricism ("creature surfacing from water," "liminal territory where truth sometimes lived") that remains consistent and apt for the meditative, ritual tone. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maren notices codes, margins, crossings-out, the interplay of past and future. No dialogue to evaluate. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstract register ("futuristic nostalgia," "ancient human need") but remains within the contemplative stance and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Voice carries a distinct literary texture ("whispered secrets finally given breath," "slipping through the cracks of suspicion like water through stone") but leans on stock elevated diction in peak beats ("festered until they demanded release"). Perceptual signature is present (stitching as encoding) though filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("saw the shape," "heard it in the nervous whispers") without dramatizing the perception. No dialogue; interiority reads as one consistent mind. Tense and focalization remain clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Maren; her perceptual signature (reading "the language of things left unsaid") is distinct and controls what she notices. Diction is elevated but consistent with her forty-year career as a medium: "cryptic," "liminal space," "evoke." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the window encounter, pulling back slightly at dawn). No head-hopping. Minor deduction: a few phrases edge toward poetic register that slightly outpaces immediate emotional pressure ("monument to her cowardice," "calcified around her heart"), though they remain voice-plausible for a reflective medium.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (translator's ear, anesthetic blur) is consistent. Diction is elevated ("gauze of evening fog," "lotus-hearted ache") and voice-motivated, though some phrases verge on ornament ("terrible poetry given context and care"). Filter verbs ("she understood," "she was known for") slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-appropriate. Dialogue is minimal (Dr. Okonkwo's single line) and functional. The final paragraph's recursive lyricism ("an ache that was lotus-hearted and ancient") charges the closure without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering setting through Mira's artist's eye ("colors...like breath onto glass," "layering brightness"). Perceptual signature is consistent: light, memory, inherited knowledge. Distance modulates purposefully, zooming to the collective ("The people came silently") then tightening to Mira's chest uncurling. Minor slips: "whatever impulse made forgotten things reach out" and "because the ruined orchard district was remembering" drift into omniscient commentary that weakens Mira's focalization at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elena notices acoustic detail, fresco damage) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted: "bewitch through a method she could not explain," "nested awakenings," "methodically infinite." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during reflection. Vocabulary remains mostly within a restorer's plausible lexicon, though a few constructions ("the acoustics turning her curiosity into something more like recognition") read as imposed rather than emerging from her voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent elevated register with strong imagery ("amber haze after thoughts became taxable"), but frequently slips into exposition that tells rather than shows. Phrases like "candidly cryptic quality that made listeners feel they were hearing two conversations at once" explain the effect rather than trusting the reader to perceive it. The single line of dialogue feels artificially stilted ("Lovely evening for cabbage") as a wink to the reader rather than natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, focused tightly on the poet's interior and perception. Diction is purposefully elevated and lyrical, matching the character's vocation and timeless isolation. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors rooted in natural growth, light, and architecture. The prose rhythm modulates well (short declaratives at "But she does not break" anchor intensity). Minor weakness: some register overlap ("ensconce," "bioluminescence," "armistice") risks feeling thesaurus-driven rather than voice-organic, though the overall texture remains coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric register ("opaline spaces between memory and loss," "weather of the world below"). Diction is elevated but consistent. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is poetic but generic—no character-specific bias or selective noticing that distinguishes this keeper from any contemplative archivist. Syntax varies purposefully, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout ("unsnarling meaning," "held-breath," "anticipation waiting to become fact"), which fits an arcane-linguist focalizer but occasionally drifts into uniform lyricism that obscures Elara's perceptual signature under stress. Elian's single line of dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, but the surrounding narration ("rough with disuse and wonder") tells emotion rather than letting the line breathe. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized," "she knew") stack in the final paragraph, dulling immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single-POV control is clean; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and technical ("geothermal heartbeat," "molecular traces," "thermal convection") but consistent with an engineer's perspective. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("slyly heartfelt in their mundane specificity," "dappled resolve") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present—she reads decay patterns, chemical signatures—but the rhythmic control flattens under emotional pressure rather than tightening. The final paragraph's syntax ("measured out link by measured link") is purposeful but the voice does not modulate with urgency; it maintains a steady, reflective cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Eleanor's perceptual signature (mapping dust motes, courier-trained patience) is distinct and purposeful. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("recalibration of a heart," "particular weight of absence") that feels slightly outside her established voice under pressure. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the blend of technical detail (transducer, crystalline formations) with lyric compression supports the Accumulative lens. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices grain, light refraction, pressure lines—but diction drifts into elevated register ("featherly determined," "fractured hush") that reads ornamental rather than character-rooted. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on the page to assess. Psychic distance holds, though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("understanding that the necessary distance…") feels like authorial intrusion rather than Elara's immediate thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV remains stable with Marek's focalization throughout. The prose carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("fever dream dreamed in reverse," "cathedral breath," "mathematicians of wonder") that suits the contemplative tone and underwater setting. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marek notices inherited objects, bioluminescent strands, archival traces—filtered through his quest. However, some diction drifts toward abstract poeticism ("softly ingenious beacon," "luminous respite") that borders on generic lyricism rather than character-specific idiom. Psychic distance remains close; no dialogue appears. The feather "recognizing something" personifies slightly but remains voice-coherent. Rhythm modulates appropriately between movement and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's professional perception ("her gift and her burden," "she had learned to love the space between knowing and imagining"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with some elevated register ("transliterate emotions," "botanical breadcrumbs") that fits a specialist's internal lexicon. The dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the fisher's "My son" and Maren's closing line advance the emotional arc. Under peak stress, Maren's perceptual texture stays consistent (tracing images, pushing deeper), though the phrase "certain souls are drawn toward distances others cannot perceive" tilts toward abstraction without grounding in her immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, filtering detail through Marek's analytical mindset. Diction ("orchestrated serendipity," "lightly attentive fingers," "analyst's smile") is distinct and purposeful. The prose modulates between reflective and sensory modes without head-hopping. Minor repetition in syntactic patterns ("not… but rather," "not… only") creates a faint template cadence, and some figurative language ("serenading monotony") borders on elevated register for the moment's pressure, but voice remains coherent and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register. Diction is elevated and figurative ("salt of her former world would evaporate," "obsidian grace of deep water"), which matches the tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that obscures immediate perception. No head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable. The prose texture is distinct, but the heavy reliance on metaphor in nearly every sentence creates a decorative density that can dull momentum rather than sharpen it. The human woman's interiority is respected; we remain with the tide dancer's focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinctive and sustained: patient, lyric, filtering the world through glass and light metaphors. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction matches the reflective focalizer ("noctilucent reckonings," "cathedral colors," "small illumination"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("each one distinct, each one connected") teach the rhythm early. Filter verbs ("she thinks," "she watches") appear frequently but feel voice-motivated rather than dulling.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mira's professional-survivor perceptual signature: she notices fire scars, training language, the mechanics of controlled burns. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "the slow dance of celestial bodies" and "hard softness" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds a firefighter's plausible idiom under emotional pressure. No dialogue on the page, so those bullets do not apply. The piece maintains psychic distance and narrative confidence throughout, supporting a solid mid-7 score.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization with consistent elevated diction and a contemplative register appropriate to the reflective mode. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific—and the narrative distance never modulates with emotional intensity because no emotional intensity appears on the page. Syntactic variety is present but the texture reads as polished essay rather than lived interior experience. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The register remains internally consistent but feels authorial rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinctive and controlled, with a lyric-textural register ("corridor echo cartographer," "sensitively perceptive eye," "记录的 of students") that sustains Mira's perceptual signature. POV distance remains stable in third-limited with consistent psychic proximity. Two Chinese characters (现代, 记录的) appear mid-sentence without translation or pattern-teaching, breaking legibility and reading as untranslated scaffold rather than voice-motivated code-switching; this is a clear artifact that dulls immediacy in two beats and triggers the filter/artifact penalty. Diction otherwise fits Mira's contemplative, archival idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present: "silver eyes taking in every detail," "smoke finding its way through stone walls." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered ("metaphysical glass," "coded frequencies," "possibilities that lived in the margins of reality"). No dialogue to evaluate. The borrowed heartbeat functions as recurring image but psychic distance stays mostly controlled. Syntax carries purposeful rhythm, though some lines edge toward overwriting ("her mirage paintings would linger...brief visions...that would catch the eye").

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "operatively gentle cadence," "particular weight of a father who had buried two sons," "geometry of a loss." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from Maren's interiority to close observation of Varen and Sera. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext ("My youngest boy...died trying to cross this very terrace"). Minor filter-verb reliance ("feeling," "recognized") is voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping, and the prose rhythm supports emotional beats without lapsing into template cadence, though the final paragraph's summarizing tone slightly loosens the grip.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance. The voice carries a clinical, mission-driven texture that fits the protagonist's engineer mindset ("precise coordinate," "synthetic warmth," "calculus in her eyes"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pregnant quiet," "fractured grace") that feels imposed rather than filtered through her practical focus. Filter verbs ("feeling the last warmth fade") are sparse and voice-motivated. The perceptual signature—emphasis on measurement, timing, environmental systems—remains consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, with a consistent elevated register that fits the courtesan's cultivated grace. Perceptual signature is present in the way beauty and gesture are filtered through coded rebellion. However, the prose occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("liminal space," "spiritual residue") that feels more like thematic commentary than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears; focalization is stable and clean. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the elevated diction under peak moments (the untangling work) can distance rather than sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured ("uncommonly serene patience," "half-lit epiphanies"), with a perceptual signature filtering the dome through Elias's craft. Distance remains stable in third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak reflection ("territorial conquest," "colonial mapping") that feels authorial rather than character-bound for a calligrapher mid-crisis. The long participial-clause sentences create a hypotactic rhythm that occasionally stalls momentum. No dialogue present to evaluate, and Mira's off-stage voice is paraphrased rather than quoted.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual filter (Elara's esoteric realist lens, her cataloging instinct, her patience). The prose carries a heightened, lyric register that remains consistent through pressure. However, the phrase "her esoteric realist's mind" recurs three times as a label rather than enacted perspective, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("signals meant for no human eye," "the patient construction of small shelters") that feels authorial rather than strictly character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled, with no head-hopping, and the narrative modulates appropriately between observation and urgency during the wind interruption.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during craft work, slightly elevated in reflection). Perceptual signature is clear: Yara notices fibers, tension, structure. Diction matches her technical background without register drift. No dialogue present. Minor slip: some phrases edge toward elevated diction ("sanctum," "pooled like water frozen mid-collapse") that occasionally float above grounded perception, though the craft vocabulary anchors voice overall. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-close with a distinct perceptual signature: "precisely playful geometries rewarding exactly the right attention" captures Foresight's selective focus. Diction is consistently lyric-elevated ("emotional cartography," "contours of meaning"), though occasional register drift ("颤动ting" is an artifact, likely a copy-paste error; "walls vibrating" corrects it in the rewrite). No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds, but the final beat's certainty ("understood with sudden clarity") overreaches into unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Maruk's perceptual signature (counting supplies "as carefully as he counted the stars," finding "grim satisfaction" in frugal oil consumption) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and period-appropriate ("sky-readers," "covenant of devotion"). One artifact: "脚步声" (Chinese characters for "footsteps") disrupts the established voice and setting without explanation or pattern, likely a generation error. The prose modulates between scholarly observation and the ritual's charged atmosphere, though the final paragraph's narratorial certainty ("they would note...their reign would proceed") overreaches what Maruk can plausibly know in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "light bent at impossible angles," "walls breathed with borrowed time" could belong to any narrator in speculative settings. Dialogue carries some subtext ("That seems pointless now") but Kael's lines often explain rather than pursue goals. The prose rhythm is controlled, yet diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("谋划" insertion feels like an artifact; "calcified his heart" and "architecture" as metaphor read strained). Filter verbs ("She had studied," "She touched") are present but not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, with a consistent elevated register suited to the material: "membranes, thin places where the dreamed and the real could press against each other like breath against glass." POV distance remains stable throughout, and the perceptual signature (selective focus on materiality, thresholds, breath) reflects Mira's professional worldview. The single brief exchange with the woman carries purpose, though her voice lacks distinctness from the narration. Under peak stress (the night of mirror-making), diction compresses appropriately while maintaining texture, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (quartz eye scattering light, tools as heirlooms) but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated, abstract register ("deciduous vows made manifest," "accidental wisdom that arrived unbidden") that strains the focalizer's immediate lexicon under pressure. Psychic distance shifts are intentional, moving from close sensory detail to reflective passages. Filter verbs ("she had convinced herself," "she could have sworn") are acceptable and voice-motivated. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from action (grinding, fitting) to stillness (the daughter's silhouette). Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Mira notices the cameo's "ridged texture" and the orchard's humming frequencies, and her internal voice carries distinct idiom ("simply complicated," "braided streams"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close reflection to cosmic scope. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits uneasily with Mira's bewildered state—"braided streams that defied every linear principle" and "brightened disquiet that tingled along her spine" read slightly ornamental. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice occasionally feels more authorial than character-specific under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and occasionally archaic ("书架's base" inserts untranslated Chinese without cue, reading as artifact or typo). Register is consistent but abstract—"delicate harmony," "quiet vibration," "crystalline note"—leaning toward placeholder lyricism rather than Elara's perceptual signature. Prose modulates little under the conceptual pressure; sentence rhythm and vocabulary remain uniform across transit and realization beats. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. Diction is lyric and elevated ("palimpsest," "calliope," "unkindled solace") but stays consistent with the narrative voice and Mira's educated, grief-soaked perspective. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature—gardens she "recognized," memories that "alter"—is specific and biased. The card's rippling surface and the brother's voice as "harmony" and "conversation" carry purposeful compression without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable, single-focalized, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated diction ("soft sigh of something ancient remembering") that fits the scholarly register. Perceptual filtering is consistent (Elena notices textile preservation details, diplomatic ciphers). No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from methodical observation to discovery without register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Mira's mapkeeper expertise; perceptual signature is consistent (vibrational currents, harmonic analysis). Diction is controlled and lyric ("silence into a forgotten luxury," "nothing-song") with purposeful elevation that matches the meditative closure. Minor wobble: "gently luminous" and "concentric circles that seemed to breathe" edge toward stock mystical phrasing without sharp sensory grounding, and the final paragraph's "nothing-song" risks poeticism over precision. No dialogue; interiority remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("thistle-blown hope," "retrocognitively blessed") fits Elara's contemplative register and the post-collapse setting's archaeological tone. Single-POV focalization remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance stays consistently close-third, layering sensory perception with interpretive reflection. Perceptual signature is present—vibration as lullaby, amber-filtered gentleness—but sentence openings recur in participial and relative-clause patterns that flatten rhythm under pressure. The prism discovery paragraph uses "and" chains and stacked clauses that slow momentum. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "realized") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at the moment of stated transformation. No dialogue appears; the piece is pure interiority and narration, which suits the solitary custodian frame.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("threshold time after fog becomes solid," "preemptively nostalgic") consistent with the archivist's contemplative role. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on shadows, resonance, and memory-as-architecture. However, the narrative voice converges with the character's philosophical interiority to the point of indistinguishability; peak moments default to abstract meditation rather than embodied perception under stress. The diction occasionally drifts into thesis-like phrasing ("collective memory was precisely this, a solid ground") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mira; perceptual signature is craft-specific (she "filtered color through flame," handles the oilcloth with reverence). Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent throughout, with purposeful compression ("catching, catching hold"). However, register occasionally slips into abstract philosophizing ("controlled combustion was possible even when the cosmos seemed to have gone dark") that reads slightly outside a working pyrotechnician's interior lexicon under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The narrative distance remains controlled, but the prose leans explanatory in beats where image alone could carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited through Mira's perceptual signature (chronicler's selective attention to transitions, textures, thresholds). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during cicada-handling, wider during reflection on the grotto's formation. The two lines of dialogue feel natural and carry subtext—"You still collect things" as both observation and tentative bridge. Diction remains consistent (mineral, liminal, threshold, patient) and voice-particular. No head-hopping; the sister's interiority is inferred through externals only.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, and diction carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("xenial," "susurrus," "intangibly tangible"). Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices silences, textures, and small growth. However, the prose leans on elevated, abstract phrasing at emotional peaks ("the paradox of her new freedom felt like a second skin too tight and too loose at once") that strains credibility for a character who spent eleven years in a bunker learning "the geometry of concrete walls." Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized," "she knew") stack in the second half, dulling immediacy when pressure should sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Maren. Diction is elevated and consistent ("silence is a room waiting for furniture," "hush vault upward") with a distinct perceptual signature (she listens to missing sounds, notes exact frequencies). Psychic distance is controlled and interior access remains character-bound. The prose reflects Maren's calm expertise without register drift. Some phrases approach over-ornamentation ("transformation made visible through motion") but remain voice-motivated and legible, and no head-hopping or elision issues appear.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and lyrically dense with a scholar's perceptual signature: "lifetimes studying lost civilizations," "fragments of magnificence," "colors so old they had fossilized." Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("liminal space," "kaleidoscopic," "suspended moments") that prioritizes atmosphere over immediate pressure. The stray Chinese character "炽热" (instead of "hot" or "burning") is a copy-editing error that breaks immersion. No dialogue; internal voice is coherent but not rhythmically varied under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness") that matches the reflective, interior mode. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract therapeutic language ("suffocating to breathe," "careful amputation of something that had grown too heavy") that sits uneasily with the physical world of charcoal and ash. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; another narrator might use similar metaphors. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV voice is consistent and textured ("virtuously mischievous by nature," "seductive pull toward possibility"). The parallel-Maya dialogue carries interference effect ("her voice crackled") but risks convenience—she articulates the thematic thesis with minimal subtext. Filter verbs are sparse; psychic distance is stable. The piece avoids head-hopping but drifts toward elevate-register metaphor ("concepts become physical," "quantum promise") that slightly exceeds Maya's established idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature is distinct throughout: "wisteria had claimed what was once a manicured terrace, weaving chaos through the bones of order" demonstrates her educated, elegiac idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises. The grandmother's voice arriving "not recorded but somehow present" maintains internal logic within the supernatural frame. Diction stays controlled and voice-specific under pressure with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is controlled and literary, with consistent elevated diction ("phosphorescent luminescence," "relentless accusations," "shivering bliss"). POV remains stable third-limited. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the peculiar pleasure of witnessing beauty while knowing it was already passing") that reads more authorial than character-filtered for a knight. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Aldric's noticing patterns don't feel idiosyncratic to his military past or current withdrawal. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct literary texture—"whispered histories," "button...as though it were a compass needle"—that is consistently elevated yet voice-motivated. Perceptual signature (archival attention, reverence for small artifacts) is clear. However, two issues lower the score: repeated syntactic stems ("she had become...she had come...she had learned") create template cadence in the opening, and diction occasionally drifts toward abstract elevation ("examining unknown the evidence of systems") that strains clarity without clear payoff. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with Mira's perceptual signature shaped by her archivist's eye ("palimpsest," "ghost-structures," "codes waiting to be deciphered"). Diction is elevated but consistent with an educated, careful mind. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Psychic distance remains close throughout. The prose occasionally drifts into abstract register ("historical contamination," "narrative"), but stays largely within Mira's professional lexicon. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's "carefully placed truth" and "weapons against any tyranny" feel slightly sermonic, a micro-slip in voice modulation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the way his breath and the morning fog became one," "the quiet vividness of the moment was not lost on him." Diction remains controlled and idiomatically consistent. However, phrases like "the prophecy's whispers lived" and "the code still dreaming in the negative space" occasionally drift toward elevated, abstracted phrasing that feels authorial rather than filtering through the saxophonist's immediate experience under pressure. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and diction ("ashen skyborne arbor," "mossy delight," "tectonic plates beneath her certainty") carries a consistent lyric-mystical register. Perceptual signature is character-specific—seeds, dust specks, veins as language—but emotional peaks rely on stock metaphors ("fingers of an old woman grasping for memory") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("understanding shifting like tectonic plates"). The phrase "emerges transformed always" is an awkward absolute that strains voice. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV is stable with clean third-limited focalization. Perceptual signature is character-specific: tinkerer's eye on "gears that obeyed predictable laws," time metaphors ("her own clock had stopped"), and methodical observation. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated; "uncertainly certain" and "bureaucratic conclusions" fit Maren's precise, skeptical mind. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue present to evaluate. The prose texture is distinct and the narrative modesty matches what Maren can plausibly know.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Maren's professional vocabulary (alchemist's scales, transmutation, liquefied gold). The prose rhythm modulates well from reflective opening to focused repair sequence. Two slips lower the score: untranslated Chinese characters appear mid-sentence ("石头 cliff face," "追求 scattered"), breaking immersion and suggesting generation artifacts. The narrative voice is distinct but occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("luminous regret," "factually mystical") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-organic, especially when Maren is presented as methodical and careful.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable; focalization remains anchored to Mira. Perceptual signature is selective ("she had learned to move through grief like water through stone") and voice carries a distinct lyric texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains believability for mid-crisis interiority: "luminous ache itself," "calcified into regret," "sacred absurdity." The soldier has no dialogue; Mira's song is paraphrased rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice differentiation. Purposeful compression in the ritual descriptions works within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with Mira's perceptual signature showing proprioceptive filtering ("every joint slightly displaced") and synesthetic processing (ultraviolet colors, frequencies felt in teeth). Diction stays character-consistent—"the mathematics of mercy," "special was just another word for damaged in a language that preferred euphemisms"—reflecting her analytical bent warped by trauma. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at "she realized with a start that this was how the remembering worked now" and opening for the closing stakes. No head-hopping; elision of the interrogation's content serves closure by keeping focus on bodily memory.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV with stable focalization throughout. The voice carries distinct texture: "elusively tangible," "unobvious trades," "vague years between childhood and now." Perceptual signature is consistent—the narrator notices translation, weight, intuition. The alchemist's dialogue feels purposeful though brief. Register occasionally drifts slightly elevated ("practitioners of unobvious trades") but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's knowledge limitations are respected until the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus reads "stories" in cables, dust, and echoes, filtering all detail through professional + supernatural lenses. Diction stays controlled ("particulate matter settling in asymmetrical waves") and voice-consistent even under pressure. The single elision—what waits above—is purposeful and paid off when the echo transmits "images of a night long ago." Distance modulates appropriately: closer during the temperature drop, pulling back for spatial choreography. No head-hopping; Marcus's certainty about the echo's reliability reads as earned inference rather than omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "raised type," "compressed histories," and "syntax" in frost, filtering setting through her letterpress expertise. Diction is elevated and consistent ("after-reality," "knowledge-wood," "aether-ships"), though occasionally opaque without immediate anchoring ("reality's terms showed through"). One filter-verb stack appears mid-passage ("She had heard," "had learned"), slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue on the page. The prose remains coherent under pressure, but the final paragraph's cadence ("The whisper had found its voice, and now the world would learn to listen") tips toward summary assertion rather than sustained image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance with Vespera's perceptual signature (poet's vocabulary, baroque architectural focus, temporal metaphors). The prose carries distinct texture: "visible time that pooled like amber honey," "burnished sorrow...grown smoother over the years." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the storm revelation. Two weaknesses prevent higher scoring: (1) "her poet's heart understanding" and similar filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy when directness would sharpen pressure; (2) register drifts slightly elevated in the penultimate paragraph ("This one—this quiet work...would succeed because it held space for multiplicity") where the diction feels more essay than embodied thought under storm conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance. Narrative stance is consistent, diction elevated but controlled: "crystalline melodies," "patience of centuries," "fragile hour when the world hung between." The prose carries a distinct lyric texture through rhythmic parallelism and selective abstraction appropriate to a forty-year meditation. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is evident in Cassian's focus on sound, mechanism, and the chip's warmth as a second heartbeat. Minor filter-verb density ("he had learned," "he knew") in reflective passages is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "sensibly eccentric," her professional idiom colors every observation. Diction remains consistent and controlled, with purposeful elevation ("cathedral's echo," "patient thinking") that fits the contemplative register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The narrative certainty matches Elara's expertise without overreach. One minor slip: "knowing she would never sell this one" in paragraph one reads slightly over-articulated for the moment, but the voice coheres under pressure and through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-close; Aria's perceptual signature (driftwood as braille, sediment metaphor) is consistent and purposeful. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter during the storm, reflective at the slide revelation. Elevated diction ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliance," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") occasionally drifts above a working sculptor's likely interior lexicon during peak moments, though it remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; the single-POV window is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "the melting of winter's last snow," "umbral tenderness," "reckon with what she was seeing." Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira's artist's eye selects color, light, and pattern throughout. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "profound patience," "the universe contains witnesses enough," "celebration of all the secret flourishing." The long, clause-heavy sentences maintain rhythm but flatten slightly under emotional intensity rather than sharpening. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"searing mixture of grief and wonder," "mechanical lullaby," "crystalline"—matching Miriam's scholarly lens. Psychic distance is controlled. The grandmother's dialogue at closure ("powers beyond human understanding," "temporal bondage") shifts into expository register, slightly diluting voice under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present in the way Miriam notices cipher patterns and archival details, lending character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is elevated and consistent, with a distinct texture ("paper-lantern cove," "raw material of remembrance"). No dialogue to judge. The prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("essence of what had been") and explanatory mode ("This was the method"). Filter verbs ("watched," "thought of") appear but do not flatten immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Voice is coherent but leans toward narrator-as-guide rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person-limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "expectation悬在半空" (a jarring non-English fragment that reads like a generation artifact but does not recur), sensory hierarchies filtered through archival/mystical expertise. Diction is elevated yet consistent—"velvet disquiet," "accumulated like sediment," "fireflies in a jar"—matching the protagonist's vocation. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: the immersion passage compresses syntax as Seraphine "shrinks," then expands at closure. One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening ("felt its absence," "understood that some silences") slightly dulls immediacy, but the effect remains controlled and voice-motivated. The Chinese character fragment is unexplained and disrupts lexical coherence; if intentional, the pattern is not taught.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and Elara's perceptual filter (focused on seeds, ritual, generational memory). Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible real-time thought—"furiously tranquil purpose," "temporal awareness through the bloodlines"—into lyric register that risks voice-over rather than lived interiority. Figurative language density is high throughout ("time to double back upon itself like a river seeking its source"), which charges atmosphere but risks overwriting in peak beats where clarity would serve pressure better.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and controlled; the third-person-limited frame consistently filters perception through Elara's professional attention. Diction is elevated but coherent ("credibly curious," "the slow majesty of something that had been waiting all day to be born"), and rhythms modulate with pressure (short clauses during the test sequence, longer syntactic units during reflection). Perceptual signature is clear: she notices microclimate shifts, instrument readings, physical textures. No dialogue appears. A few phrases approach stock lyricism ("rose like a dawn," "borrowed warning"), but the voice remains distinct and purpose-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance"), but register drifts into corporate abstraction ("sacred importance of witnessing," "empathy the cosmic janitor had cultivated") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; the janitor notices via summary rather than idiosyncratic detail. Sentence stems repeat ("The cosmic janitor…" opens four paragraphs; "They [verb]" recurs throughout), creating template cadence. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric register—"tranquilly perceptive," "astonished recluse"—that matches the contemplative stakes. Diction remains elevated but consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor issue: "astonished recluse" and similar constructions risk label-only characterization, and the perceptual signature (light through glass, moth-wing edges) is vivid but not character-specific—another observer might notice the same details. No dialogue present; the ghost's gestures are clean. Psychic distance is controlled, though the ending ("unspoken words had found their keeper at last") drifts toward narratorial commentary rather than staying inside Mira's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyrically consistent with purpose-driven elevation ("borrowed hours," "hemorrhage meaning"), and POV distance remains stable. However, diction drifts into essay register during reflection—"chronology itself began to hemorrhage meaning," "post-numerical economy of meaning"—clashing with the intimate texture elsewhere. Perceptual signature is present but static; the narrator's way of noticing does not shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the poet notices "barbs," "vanes," and "iridescence" with attentive specificity, and diction remains poetic but grounded ("bottle-green," "burnished hush," "gesturing toward the clouds"). Filter verbs ("saw," "understood," "realized") appear frequently but serve voice coherence rather than dull immediacy. One notable weakness: the phrase "the poet thought" in the final third breaks the established free-indirect flow, and the final two paragraphs toggle into summary-future mode ("The poem that the quiet shoreline poet would write that evening would not resolve...") which shifts tense and distance without full integration into the present scene's pressure. The future-conditional framing functions thematically but loosens narrative grip at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (botanical precision, architectural thinking). Diction is elevated but character-appropriate for a decades-long caretaker. However, several phrases drift into elevated register that feels writerly rather than urgently embodied: "the familiar braze of calm" (likely "blaze," but either reads precious), "respecting between species," "the great storms of the previous century." Filter verbs ("she could see," "she had learned") are frequent but voice-motivated. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elena throughout, with no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent elevated, philosophical register and the perceptual filter remains hers (scientific mind, empirical worldview). However, the diction often drifts into generic lyricism ("luminous skepticism," "bronze quiet," "chemistry of homecoming") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Under peak moments the prose remains at the same reflective distance without modulation. Purposeful compression is minimal; the piece reads as steady meditation rather than voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, anchored in the coachman's perception throughout. The prose carries a distinct, elevated texture—"narrow vastness," "the purple hour before night," "the cold patience of witnesses"—but the register occasionally drifts into essayistic abstraction ("a mediator between endings and beginnings") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present: he reads bird calls, reef skeletons, and the "grain" of seed pods with professional specificity. One typo: "fertilizeed" disrupts the final third and triggers a minor craft penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (bloodhound scent-reading, texture-as-language) maintain coherence. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent—no mid-paragraph head-hopping or register clash. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The narrator's way of noticing (composition of metals, ridge-and-valley meaning) is character-specific. Elision is purposeful (brother's departure → cylinder's hiding) and the revelation is paid off on the page. The final paragraph's slightly uniform cadence and reliance on "understood" / "knew" verbal stems reduce propulsion slightly but do not obscure clarity or break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (sky-watcher idiom, temporal vocabulary) but diction drifts into elevated register: "stretched thin across the fabric of subjective hours," "echoed silence that reverberated." Under the reflective pressure of the ending, syntax remains formal and distanced rather than tightening or varying with emotional intensity. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in limited third, and the prose carries a distinct elevated register ("threshold markets," "対齐towers," "sacredly playful wonder"). However, the diction drifts into ornamental lyricism during peak beats ("secrets inside waiting like trapped birds") without grounding in action or perception. The "Wait—I have miscounted" section reads as an unmotivated structural hiccup; the retelling compresses but does not teach a pattern or serve closure. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Seraph's "You came" and Caelius's explanation lack subtext or goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present but generic (cold, sky, tears in dreams).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric-textural signature ("benevolently ruthless efficiency," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence"). Diction remains elevated but voice-coherent throughout. However, register drift appears in peak moments: "the acknowledgment that absence could hold its own meaning, its own weight, its own terrible light" slips into philosophical exposition that feels externally imposed rather than filtered through Mira's lived perception. The piece remains clean in mechanics and free of head-hopping, but the narrator occasionally assists comprehension rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric register ("mercury-glass," "infinite shelves," "feathered ridges") that suits the protagonist. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative voice carries a distinct texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during emotional peaks ("permissions, a vocabulary of healing," "sacred language") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. The keeper's dialogue is purpose-driven and distinct. Elision of the seven nights is purposeful compression that serves accumulative pressure, though some interiority becomes summary ("she finally understood") rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-particular: "what they called her failure," "the price of teaching someone that some pieces were worth more than survival." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tapestry work, wider for village tableau). No head-hopping. Vocabulary ("winnowed," "fierce repose") fits an educated, exiled tutor. Compression at closure (final paragraph shifts rapidly from tapestry completion to walking) is minor but noticeable; the reflective summary ("she had come here to forgive herself") briefly tells what the scene has been showing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and literary, with controlled register ("pale spire in mist rose...like a finger pointing toward accusation"). Free indirect style is clean throughout. The dialogue feels slightly elevated for an eight-year-old ("They say un-making is sin") but remains legible within the temple-novice frame. Perceptual signature is consistent: Sera notices echoes, mist, bone texture. However, the priests are rendered only through "rigid lines of stolen authority"—a tell rather than a shown gesture—and lack distinct presence. Distance is stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with controlled access to the alchemist's interiority. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("kintsugi intentions," "quilting memories," "negative space") but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical register ("uncertainty was itself a form of honest magic") that strains the POV's plausible lexicon during a three-breath crisis. The perceptual signature is selective—wounds, scars, and metal memory dominate attention as expected. Purposeful compression in the ritual sequence (each pockmark = chapter) supports the Accumulative design. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear but remain voice-motivated given the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative distance modulates effectively with Marcus's introspection. Voice is controlled and lyric, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the gesture of sharing beauty before letting it go") that sits awkwardly against cave-wandering urgency. Filter verbs ("he understood," "he realized") cluster in key beats without clear voice motivation, and the syntactic rhythm grows uniform in the reflective passages, flattening propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Mira's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent ("bruised clouds," "frequency that could reach into troubled waters"), though some phrases verge on writerly self-consciousness ("the verbal equivalent of grasping hands"). The line "she sent instead a vibration that had no name, a frequency of pure wanting-them-safe" compresses the climax into abstraction rather than embodied action. Psychic distance is controlled, but at peak pressure the prose leans toward summary of interior state rather than dramatized micro-choices. No head-hopping; voice is distinct but occasionally slides toward poetic commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (moon phases as tide, grief as cartography) is specific and sustained. The dialogue between Mara and the woman is natural, economical, and goal-driven: "Stay where you are. I'm coming to meet you." Register remains consistent; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "the only terrain that truly mattered" drifts slightly into narrator commentary rather than strict POV modesty, though it remains plausible as Mara's conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV with stable third-limited focalization and a distinct texture: "fractured but functional, damaged but directed, graceful in the broken way." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful metaphoric density. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—Mira's forager lens is asserted but not embodied in how she uniquely notices the world. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("the patient architecture of persistence") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. No dialogue to test distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed memories settling into his bones like tide marks"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a lighthouse keeper's interior lexicon ("epistemological," "hermeneutic" feel without those exact words—"resisted understanding like a puzzle missing its essential piece"). Psychic distance is controlled, though the retrospective omniscience about the mother's regret ("dying woman who had spent decades regretting") exceeds what Aldric could infer from a note alone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with clean focalization on Maren's perceptions. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices maps, foundries, cartographic logic, and the physical properties of paper and brass. Diction stays consistent—"empirically intuitive" and "accumulated like sediment" reflect her professional vocabulary. No dialogue appears, so voice is judged solely through narrative texture. Psychic distance is controlled, though occasional phrases like "she understood then" slightly tell rather than show the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a distinct, elevated register ("violet dusk," "lacy menace," "captured starlight") that remains consistent under pressure and reflects the queen's particular way of noticing. POV distance is stable throughout; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("Just a little further") feels voice-consistent and purposeful. Perceptual signature is strong (memories that "no longer sparkled," air that "tasted of frost"), and psychic distance modulates intentionally from intimate interiority to wider observation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable and third-limited, but the narrative voice drifts into elevated academic register ("logarithmic curves," "alchemical principle," "essential aliveness") that clashes with the intimate firelight scene. Dialogue is minimal; Sera's one question and Maren's responses feel expository rather than goal-driven or carrying subtext. Perceptual signature is inconsistent—Maren's scientist lens competes with lyric philosopher without a clear hierarchy. Filter verbs ("she watched understanding kindle") dull immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    First-person voice maintains a consistent lyric register with distinct perceptual signature: "time moved like a drunk dancer," "lucidity is not a gift but a curse disguised as clarity." Psychic distance remains stable within reflection; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("penitente counting sins," "Möbius strip of recursive meaning") occasionally drifts from immediate embodied perception into essayistic phrasing, and the opening scroll metaphor ("like a wounded animal surrendering its secrets") mixes vehicles. Free indirect style is clean, and purposeful compression (dream/waking elision) is taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elena with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "invisible things," "architecture of time," fog as occluded view. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though a few lines drift toward elevated register ("occluded," "humanize through occluded views"). The phrase "The humanize through occluded views" in paragraph seven appears ungrammatical or incomplete, suggesting either a typo or over-compression that harms clarity. Psychic distance modulates appropriately. No dialogue present, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elara notices ink-stains, pale scars, the quill's trimmed tip—details filtered through a scholar's attention. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("crystallizing affliction," "married academic precision with intuition") that reads slightly formal for peak emotional beats but remains within a scholar's plausible lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the inscription climax. No dialogue is present; evaluate voice on narration alone. Syntax and rhythm support pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eleanor's perceptual signature is consistent: she filters through metaphor and avoids direct confrontation until the apology forces simplicity. The shift from her habitual riddles to "words felt like stones" demonstrates voice modulation under pressure. Margot's dialogue ("You always spoke in riddles when the truth was too heavy") feels natural and advances conflict. Free indirect style is clean throughout, and psychic distance narrows appropriately as the currents fade, though Margot's interiority remains shadowed by her ghostly state rather than fully voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV; stable distance and tense; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and carries a distinct lyric texture ("breathless interval," "resounding hush"). However, the prose relies on elevated register throughout without modulation under pressure, and perceptual signature remains generic contemplation rather than character-particular noticing. Filter verbs ("she had learned") appear but do not dull immediacy given the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Aira notices calibration, droplet timing, atmospheric alignment). Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for reflection and tightening for the climactic realization. However, elevated diction in peak beats—"razor edges of clarity," "knife-edge dividing one world from another," "frequency in the spaces between ticks"—occasionally drifts from the established voice into lyric register that feels imposed rather than character-organic. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elara's perception throughout. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("probability map," "lucid contradiction," "clover melancholy"). The single line of dialogue—"I figured out what the scrawls mean... They're invitations. To stop playing and start living."—feels slightly thesis-adjacent but not overtly sermonic, and it's filtered through Elara's idiom. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Minor diction elevation in the final paragraph ("mathematics of loss," "multiplication of meaning") hovers near abstraction but remains within the professor-daughter's plausible lexicon under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's eleven-year intimacy with tunnel rhythms, her metaphoric register (arteries, frequencies, thresholds), and her precise occupational lens. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose texture is literary and assured, with purposeful compression in phrases like "melodically haunted" and "loss sounds when you have lived with it long enough that it became the air itself," though minor elevation in register ("cultivated estrangement") borders on authorial rather than character-native phrasing under peak reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable single third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is archival and profession-specific: "walnut-ink archivist," "cataloging not just what could be written down," "approaching memory the way one steeps tea." Diction stays within character ("proximate causes," "haunted euphoria") without unmotivated register shifts. Two slips lower the score: "currency the future possessed" and "stitched together from photographs and memories" in the final paragraph both drift toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds the established texture under peak emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with consistent psychic distance. The logistician's perceptual signature—weary, jocular self-protection—colors description ("improbable rumor chains," "somewhere between charming and unsettling"). Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext, especially the logistician's deflective joke and the woman's knowing smile. However, some diction slips into elevated register ("predated every modern system of currency," "liminal space") that feels more essayistic than character-filtered. The closing line's rhythm ("truly laughed—and the sound echoed") provides strong cadence control, though earlier passages lean toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature—blindness prioritizing sound, touch, and vibration—is consistent and purposeful. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the meditative tone, though phrases like "ultrasonic cathedral" and "the whole discourse of existence" drift toward abstract register that feels authorial rather than character-particular under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, and there is no head-hopping. However, the narration occasionally asserts knowledge beyond Elara's plausible inference ("the old cartographers called the Still"), and the final paragraph's certainty ("she would never be lost again") reads as narratorial pronouncement rather than filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature (patient, metaphor-inclined, comfort-seeking) consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "whispers of distant suns," "threshing meaning from experience." No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she thought") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in the key signal-work beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider reflection. One slip: "the way this particular frequency seemed to search for something" momentarily grants the signal quasi-agency in a way that blurs whether this is Mira's interpretation or narratorial assertion. Rhythmic control is steady, though the reflective middle stretch risks flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature filters the harbor through Marina's interpreter lens (gesture, silence, pattern). Vocabulary occasionally inflates ("unreasonable beauty," "particular rhythm of loss") beyond naturalistic interiority, nudging into essayistic register. The phrase "the shapes that living makes when no one is watching" reads as authorial philosophy rather than Marina's lived thought. Otherwise, psychic distance modulates purposefully and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is present in Mira's attention to artistic detail but does not degrade under stress. No dialogue on the page to judge. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") dull immediacy without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (frequencies as "secret songs," stars vomited into a basin) is distinctive. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register incongruous with on-page urgency: "auroral sorrow of a universe that had taken too much" reads as authorial rather than Elara's lived syntax. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Mira notices "the cartography of someone who had walked every meter until it became memory," identifies colleagues by gait, reads steel's groan. Psychic distance is stable; diction remains consistent and voice-particular ("calculus of sound," "mycelium through soil"). The single exchange with Reyes carries subtext and goal pursuit. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Rhythm modulates well under pressure. One small slip: "the weight of that statement hanging between them" tells the effect rather than trusting the line itself to land.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person POV filtered through the guardian is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she hears "what others missed" and reads weight in body language—though register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "mathematics of pain") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Purposeful compression ("the frequency of unspoken longing") and lyric rhythm support the accumulative lens. The boy's interiority is withheld by design, maintaining distance, but his silence and gaze carry subtext. No dialogue appears; evaluation skips those bullets.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Eleanor's professional lens (chess coaching, teaching patience). Diction is elevated and consistent ("cobalt library," "magnetic grotto," "amplified quiet") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the hush where past meets prophecy") that feels external to Eleanor's idiom. No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is present (she "catches whispers that never escaped minds") but not tested under pressure. The final paragraph modulates into a more declarative, summarizing tone that distances from Eleanor's lived experience, flattening voice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider lyric observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "elegy than silhouette," "combative tenderness," "sublittoral fringe." Perceptual signature is consistent—Maren notices the world through labor and guardedness. Some register drift occurs: "re-education ships," "fortress engineers," and "combative tenderness" read slightly elevated for a dock worker's interior lexicon, though they may reflect narrator overlay. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Purposeful compression in the final paragraphs maintains clarity under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person; psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate in whittling beats, theatrical in narrated passages). Perceptual signature is distinct: performer's idiom ("The performance concludes," "The curtain falls"), precise craft attention ("knife descends…wood yields"), and defiant understatement. Diction remains character-bound throughout. The narrator's self-aware compression ("I am morally ambiguous. I know this about myself") reads slightly diagnostic but is immediately grounded in concrete past (performing "while harboring…darkness"). No head-hopping, tense drift, or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature filtering the atrium through aesthetic observation. Diction carries purposeful elevation ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow verses") that fits the poet's voice. However, register drifts into abstraction during peak moments ("dissolution of the invisible walls that had divided not territory but perception itself") where embodied immediacy would serve pressure better. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mira throughout with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during her arranging, wider during the glassblower's observation). Perceptual signature is strong: "constant subtle shift of light and shadow, texture and form" filters her world-view and her colorblindness is shown through how she sees rather than told. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the apprentice's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit. One brief filter-verb cluster in the opening ("She had bartered... had given... had deemed") slows momentum slightly but remains voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy. Diction stays consistent with the contemplative, lyric register; no mid-paragraph register drift. The phrase "innocently cunning smile" is asserted rather than shown in action, a minor tell within otherwise clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature is present (holding objects to her ear, noticing golden shadows, professional vocabulary like "prism-song bell ringer"). Diction is elevated and literary, fitting the reflective mode, though some constructions veer toward exposition ("a resonance that no factory-made component could replicate"). No dialogue appears. The prose maintains a singular texture, though rhythm remains fairly even across beats rather than modulating with pressure. Filter verbs are controlled and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Elara. Diction ("curtains of intention," "vertigo," "subdued ardor") is distinctive and consistent. The pendant dialogue carries subtext (offering a relic of grief as welcome). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reflective opening to present-scene action. Filter verbs ("sensed," "understood," "watched") cluster but remain voice-motivated. The new arrival's translucent flicker is shown through Elara's perception without head-hopping. Rhythm varies between contemplative backstory and present beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Maren with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters through cartomancer knowledge ("inherited mystery," "steady curiosity"). Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; Maren's "Tell me what brings you here" and "The cards don't judge" carry subtext and advance plot. Diction stays within register except for one slip: "the collective belief that digital tokens could somehow replace the older currencies of connection, craft, and trust" reads slightly elevated for in-scene interiority, though it could be Maren's educated voice. Psychic distance modulates appropriately when she moves from observation to reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistently elevated and meditative, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on memory, light, and philosophical abstraction. Psychic distance remains stable. Register occasionally climbs into academic diction ("electrical impulses," "systematic approach") that fits the historian but can feel distancing. The prose maintains coherence across the reflection-heavy structure, and the saffron veil, bronze facets, and luminescent motes create sensory anchors. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "sharp eyes catching the way hope accumulated in corners," "luminous regret that hung around certain frames like halos." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close when Mira touches the stone, wider when describing the Unbinding's history). Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon—poetic but grounded in her role as archivist. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects Mira's contemplative mind under sustained attention rather than crisis pressure, and the rhythmic control supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tool work, wider when reflecting on staff). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices scales, terrariums, organizational systems—revealing her handler lens. Diction stays within her professional register without corporate drift. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored. The prose texture ("whispers of what they had once been," "scattered salt on black velvet") occasionally elevates beyond urgent Mara-think but remains voice-motivated and legible. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Maya's perceptual lens. Diction carries a distinct texture ("suspended moment," "quiet intrusion") and sensory detail (cold stone, frost migration) reflects her gradual awakening. However, some phrasing slides into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("accidental telepathy of her recovering mind," "displaced miracle of her survival"). The grandmother's riddle and the brother's echo both read as over-articulate for their emotional stakes, slightly undermining voice modesty under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature—"spatially imaginative mind maps these invisible landscapes in layers"—colors her observations. Diction is elevated and lyric ("quiet violence of hushed thunder," "cinema of unfinished endings") yet remains within a crystal gazer's plausible idiom. Psychic distance is consistent, though the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority that explains rather than enacts: "she understood now why she had been drawn to this place" states the insight rather than showing micro-choices that reveal it.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third-limited is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("shadowed rapture," "unwritten calendar," "remembered stardust"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("moonstruck dreamer," "sacred rest of this luminous moment"). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is poetic but not character-specific; phrases like "unspoken words" and "aurora-scented air" read as generic lyric rather than Seraphine's unique way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("charm worked through wave functions," "burned paper" eyes, "wind through the remains of flute") that is lyric without obscuring clarity. Dialogue feels purposeful and distinct (merchant's grief-tinged smile, Mira's clipped refusal). The prose modulates appropriately under pressure. Minor register drift: "smile at uncertainty until it relaxed" feels slightly over-articulated for the urgency, but the perceptual signature (Mira's route-honed attention) remains consistent. Psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Cyrus's philosophical perception. Diction is elevated and consistent—"coordinate-less terrain," "ambient vibration," "frequency of probable miracles"—but the register never modulates under pressure; peak moments (kneeling at the tangle, stepping through the doorway) maintain the same lyric distance as expository passages. Perceptual signature is present (reading tree-melodies like scores, unraveling meaning as ancient arguments) but does not degrade or sharpen with stress. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains static, and the prose reads more like narrated philosophy than embodied crisis, limiting voice-as-character effect.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; the woman's perceptual signature (sky and sea "forgot their boundaries," heartbeat as "quiet stubbornness") is consistent and voice-driven. Diction elevates under pressure ("cotton and shadow," "valleys of memory") without breaking POV lexicon, though "genuine struggle rather than mere wishing" in paragraph three edges toward authorial summary. The single line of dialogue ("Why does courage hide?") carries subtext (a lifetime's question compressed), and the guides' wordless communication sustains tone. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she understood") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable; Marcus's perceptual signature (nerve-sensitized hearing, choir-trained silence) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for a bellhop mid-shift: "the seraphically mundane nature of the discovery," "evidence that someone else had passed this way," and "unpardonable silence was not what he had failed to say but what he had chosen to believe" read as authorial rather than character-bound thought. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure, but the lexical reach prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyric voice is sustained and distinct ("knowledge slumbered in decaying volumes," "dust motes drifted like memories"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated, decorative diction that never modulates with pressure because no pressure exists on the page. Perceptual signature is consistent but not tested under stress. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; distance modulates purposefully between immediate observation and brief reflective passages. Voice carries a distinct texture: "drifted at the confluence," "periodically eternal processes," "corridors of migration... erased by temperature spikes." Perceptual signature is consistent—scientific yet elegiac—though under peak stress (the buoy revelation) the prose does not compress or tighten notably. Free indirect style is clean. Elara's lexicon (cartographer's daughter, coral ecologist) guides diction without register mismatch. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly know; the delayed revelation is earned by the buoy signals, not withheld artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kira, with clear perceptual signature: her bare feet, her preference for "the margin of daylight," her habitual tracing of constellations. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("cavernous," "dormant robotic arms," "frozen sentinels"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the circle's center. One minor friction: "awkwardly confident stride, head high despite the dust and silence, because she had decided that confidence was something you performed until it became real" slips into expository self-awareness that feels more like narrator commentary than Kira's lived thought. No dialogue to evaluate. Rhythm varies naturally without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with Yara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct (plants speak in "colors and temperature shifts," silence valued due to her mother's burning). Diction occasionally inflates under pressure ("hybrid futures and evolved consciousness," "genetic script and ancient wisdom") but recovers quickly. Anya's dialogue carries defiance credibly. The embryo "pulsing with warmth" at closure risks convenient magic rather than POV-earned perception, yet the overall voice texture supports the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; perceptual signature is trauma-filtered (sound that was "louder than sound," sky that "opened and took everything except her hands"). Diction stays character-particular ("gift felt too simple a word," "phantom limbs") with purposeful elevation that matches her plant expertise. Two brief therapy-adjacent phrases ("somatic markers," "nervous system") risk register drift but are contextualized through embodied action. Psychic distance modulates effectively between close sensory work and reflective passages, with the final cereus moment tightening to immediate tactile focus.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices via artist's eyes ("tracking the patterns," "muscle memory of someone who had spent years reading faces"). Diction fits her profession and the lyric register throughout. The rhetorical questions ("or had she?" / "How long had this place existed?") are consistent and purposeful, teaching the pattern early. However, elevated constructions like "the answer kept shifting like watercolors bleeding into one another" and "luminescence of her aching clarity" in peak beats edge toward overwriting that slightly obscures urgency. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on the tracker; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated texture with purposeful diction ("ephemeral patterns," "temporal dynamics," "consciously wild"). However, the register sometimes drifts into abstract philosophizing that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "the universe refused to follow reasonable rules" and "serene, angry smile that had frightened his superiors." Perceptual signature is present—the tracker's trained ability to read ink patterns, hear the drone's frequency—but sentence-level rhythm is sometimes sluggish, with long participial chains that flatten urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance and tense hold throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("small apocalypse," "desperate fingers," "songs to life"), though some diction drifts elevated ("the mythology she had been raised to cherish") during peak beats. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (archivist's lens on vaults, networks, preservation protocols) but not deeply idiosyncratic. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (trembling hands, stopped trembling), and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the decision. Filter verbs are light. However, the voice occasionally converges on prompt language ("bravely conflicted," "dangerous liaison," "contraband truths") in ways that feel externally imposed rather than organically Kira's register.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("sheathed blade of memory," "thorned blossoms pushed through sand") and a stable third-person limited POV. Psychic distance is consistent and voice-motivated register elevations fit the reflective mode. However, several phrases approach stock literary phrasing ("like water finding its level," "burning against the sand") and the narrative certainty remains high throughout despite operating in retrospective summary, which reduces tension in the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct elevated register ("transliterate," "voice silence itself") that fits a mythic frame. The perceptual signature—Morwen seeing sound as ripples, feeling emotion as weight—is consistent and character-specific. Some diction feels slightly over-wrought in peak beats ("purpose fractured and timing askew," "grief that was also a bell") where compression might serve better, but the voice remains coherent. No dialogue to judge. The final paragraph's summary mode ("a cool-headed fisher who had spent his life mastering stillness") tells what has been shown, diluting immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Eleanor throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: her cataloging habit ("the way her father paused before lying, the pattern of typos") colors observations in character-specific ways. Diction is controlled and elevated in a manner consistent with her analytical mind. Minor slips: "the journalist's accusations dissolving into static like smoke" mixes metaphors (dissolution vs. smoke), and "clouds drifting below" recurs without fresh angle. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and offers some perceptual signature ("the reverence of someone handling a prayer"), but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgent discovery: "dissonance of that old guilt," "firmament of her broken timeline," "current of pure intention." Filter verbs stack in the final section ("understood," "could see") during what should be peak intensity. The prose reads as singular voice throughout, avoiding head-hopping, but the lexicon feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all perception through Elara's artist's eye and emotional state. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("a key forced into the wrong lock," "beauty that existed not despite impermanence but because of it"), with perceptual signature (socially perceptive eye catching mist pooling, spiral alignment). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, close during mandala work and tile discovery, stepping back for the final exhale. The prose texture is distinct—lyric without purple, rhythmic without mechanical patterning. No dialogue, so those bullets are moot. Reaches high-8s for rhythmic control and clean interiority with zero head-hopping or filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lysara's perceptual signature evident in her reading of the tessera as "language" and her recognition of Soren's retrocognitive echo. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure, and the diction—"gentle radical," "aberrant mercy"—fits the elevated register of the character's interior world. However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory summary ("This affliction had become her gift, though none around her understood") that tells rather than trusts the reader to infer from action. The single line of dialogue ("You see them") is purposeful and subtext-laden, though more exchange would have tested voice distinction. One minor slip: "允许 a single shaft of light" appears to be a typographical artifact (Chinese character intrusion) that disrupts the English sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during her reflection, wider during Mira's introduction). Diction is mostly voice-consistent ("synesthetically blessed," "threshold place") though "suicide of hope" and "might-have-been and could-still-be" tilt toward elevated abstraction during peak beats. Elara's perceptual signature (synesthesia) is invoked but never filters action or choice under pressure. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable focalization. Perceptual signature is present (scientific training versus "something deeper") and diction mostly fits Mira's technical background. Purposeful compression in the somatic-marker passage works. However, elevated register appears in peak beats: "delicate, luminous threads," "the body's intricate signals," "fragile and breakable, but still beautiful" stack poetic abstractions where concrete perception would sharpen pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt like recognition") cluster in the geode-contact sequence without voice motivation, dulling immediacy at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; voice carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("maritime anachronism," "factually mystical") that fits the post-Sleep world-building. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a fact that had become legend, a legend that was actually memory") that dilates the perceptual signature without advancing pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are present, but the final paragraph's thesis-like articulation ("she was not documenting the unknown. She was becoming its voice") breaks the established perceptual filter with over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("honeyed glow," "unearthed silence," "raw and vital") builds a consistent lyric texture. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices "emotional resonance" and tactile traces—but the voice drifts into abstract register ("prophecy to breathe and change") in the final third. Under closure pressure, syntax remains controlled but the final paragraph's summary mode ("She had learned that…") distances rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elena's perceptual signature (spy training, pattern-reading) is consistent. The prose texture—elevated diction ("silver hush," "vouchsafe")—matches the spy-thriller register without register drift. The ally's dialogue ("I vouchsafe you my word") carries distinct formality and advances plot by offering partnership. Purposeful compression in the snow-code description works without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, meditative texture with purposeful diction ("palimpsest," "spindrift serenity," "ambient awareness"). However, much of the vocabulary sits at the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon—"palimpsest" and "percolated" feel slightly elevated for a coachman's internal voice, creating minor register drift. Psychic distance is consistent, and the reflective mode is anchored in present stimuli (fog, needle, rain gutters), but the voice occasionally tips toward essayistic rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through touch, light, and craft metaphors. Diction ("honeyed vibration," "sigh that had lost its fire") is purposeful and consistent. Psychic distance contracts during the lantern encounter, appropriately intimate. Minor artifact: "phototropic to kindness, had been since birth" reads as brief exposition that could anchor more concretely in a present cue. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she found," "she felt") are voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with the scene's contemplative pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Maren's perceptual signature (gardener's patience, lockmaster's lexicon) is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and purpose-driven, with Maren's explanations carrying subtext about her own grief. However, "protected vulnerability of a child learning that loss wasn't the end of the story" is a narratorial gloss that steps outside Maren's idiom into meta-commentary. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but peak emotional beats occasionally shift into elevated diction ("quivering hush," "wistfully pragmatic") that reads ornamental rather than voice-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("brittle awakenings," "frequency, a channel through which one could receive wisdom unavailable in chorus") that fits Elara's custodial role. However, register drifts into elevated philosophical phrasing at peak beats ("profound, hard-won connection to everything that had passed through and everything that would yet become") that edges beyond the POV's lived idiom. Perceptual signature is strong (reading tidal currents, recognizing extinct species in reflections) and remains selective to her expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is lyric and consistent: "white prayer," "world that had just wept," "prismatic quiet." Psychic distance is stable, filtered through Mira's perceptual signature. However, two passages drift into elevated register beyond her established idiom: "patent spiraling twigs...Nautilus curve...mathematical secret" and "prismatic quiet" feel ornamental rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space between perception and emotion," "ethereal grit of her situation settled into her bones like a second skeleton") that reads more authorial than character-specific. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature is weak—Maya notices in generic technical terms rather than with a celestial interpreter's particular bias. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") appear frequently but don't obscure immediacy enough to penalize heavily.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct texture ("origami made of shadow and silence," "wound in the stone"). Diction remains within Elara's register with purposeful elevation that matches her scholarly background. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress (the organ transfixing her), and perceptual signature is consistent—she notices the compass warmth, the geometry, the music through a lens of intellectual curiosity tempered by visceral fear. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "aperture," "architecture of emotion," "counterweight." Distance is controlled and diction matches Elena's interior lexicon. However, several lines drift into elevated register that feels imposed rather than voice-organic: "time's patient work," "death's silence," "emotional sediment." The closing passage ("methodical and patient") reprises diction from the opening without heightening pressure, reading as summary rather than embodied closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maren throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (cartographic shorthand, ink-stained focus) and diction mostly fits an archivist's idiom. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, pulling close for the nail's warmth and pulling back for institutional history. However, register drifts into academic abstractions ("posthumous exile," "palimpsest of suppressed knowledge," "intergenerational tragedy") that feel more like authorial thesis than Maren's interior lexicon under pressure. The final line's "nervously confident stride of someone who had finally found the map she had been searching for" tells rather than enacts the trait through syntax or gesture. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric and image-dense, with a consistent perceptual signature ("copper light bled," "luminous beads on a dark string"). Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains stable. However, elevated diction ("dynamically observant," "luminous disbelief," "impossible testimony") appears in nearly every paragraph, creating a register plateau that doesn't modulate under pressure. The hitchhiker speaks once in quoted dialogue ("The flakes are still up there…"), but their voice is indistinct from the narrative register. No head-hopping, and POV knowledge remains character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV distance is stable, and Marcus's perceptual filter (reading landscapes for markers) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Elena's lines pursue goals but lack subtext or distinct idiom beyond the repeated "dusky harmony" descriptor. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("itinerant dreams," "transient and permanent had learned to coexist") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, slightly weakening the voice's grounding in Marcus's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lucid dream chronicler," "pulsing in its long, slow rhythm"), though register occasionally drifts into workshop idiom ("burden of knowledge," "healing words") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled but lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing is general astronomer rather than distinctly hers. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("midnight solace," "healing words") coheres with the reflective mode but flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Kaelen's perception. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("動作 deliberate and certain" introduces a typographical anomaly—likely a generation artifact—that disrupts voice momentarily). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout, matching a druid's perspective. Filter verbs ("could feel," "watched") appear but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is evident in how Kaelen notices magical geography and transformative processes, though some phrases ("warlike serenity," "what mirrors don't show") feel more authorial than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with deep interiority; perceptual signature is distinct—"dreams that came to her each equinox," "the language of offerings." Diction is elevated and consistent ("root-bound," "covenant," "eclipse") but occasionally slips into abstract register ("possibilities not yet crystallized into form"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure: "not painful but piercing, a illumination of all the paths" (minor article error noted). Elision is purposeful—decades compressed into observation—and the final expansion is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is evident in the way Elara notices roots "inlaying meaning" and trees bearing fruit "from the substance of the long-departed," reflecting her grief-oriented lens. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register ("trammel the grief," "currencies of being," "architecture of being") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, especially since Elara's voice is otherwise concrete and sensory. The prose as character principle weakens when abstractions cluster in peak beats rather than emerging from concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited with consistent access to Marcus's thoughts and no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—cataloging facts as insulation, the grille cloth ritual—is character-specific. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated literary register that clashes with a roadie-turned-appraiser's plausible lexicon: "insulating emotionally with facts the way sound-dampening material insulated venues" and "the electric moments before lights went down" read more authorial than character-rooted. Syntax under peak pressure (the phone moment) stays controlled but doesn't meaningfully shift rhythm to reflect urgency. Purposeful elision around "the funeral and the dissolution" is voice-appropriate for a character avoiding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, with distinct perceptual coloring (cuneiform translator's lens on "wedge-marked clay," "pictographs abstracting into sounds"). Psychic distance is stable. However, elevated diction in peak beats ("the physics of transition," "analogical thinking," "perpetual becoming") drifts above the POV's immediate sensory frame under pressure, creating a mild register mismatch. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("she understood," "she thought") dull immediacy when not voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV with stable third-person limited focalization; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent, deliberate rhythm—elevated, meditative diction matched to a timeless librarian perspective. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and the lexicon (titan-gear, wintersun, lunar devotion) feels voice-motivated. However, under peak moments (smelting, the foundry chamber), the voice does not modulate or compress; it maintains the same stately cadence throughout, flattening urgency. Psychic distance remains fixed rather than shifting to serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV held throughout; psychic distance is stable and close. Margret's perceptual signature (professional evaluator noting "expired rations and rusted bunks," then reorienting to beauty and confession) is consistent. Diction fits her voice: "certification manual," "air filtration capacity," "inventory." One pattern slip: "latent radiance, light that existed in potential" and "acquiring abandoned hopes" read slightly expository rather than filtered through her interiority, breaking narrative modesty briefly. Rhythm modulates well from inspection cadence to lyric revelation. No dialogue to judge. Tense and stance are stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the chronicler's precision ("daringly methodical patience," mapping "with the same precision she brought to riverbanks") filters all observation. Diction stays within register (river/mapping vocabulary, "palimpsest," "liminal"). Internal voice modulates appropriately under emotional pressure (short breaths, longer lyric passages in reflection). No head-hopping. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("she had learned," "she understood") in peak beats slightly dull immediacy, and "allude[d]" appears to be a typo for "alluded."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice attempts a lyric register with phrases like "mist pooled against the library's marble steps like spilled memories" and "cautious exuberant," but these abstract elevations ("ancient recognition," "Möbius strip of discovery") clash with the protagonist's on-page passivity and lack of perceptual signature. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Register drift into philosophical abstraction ("propagation delays between understanding and revelation") occurs during peak moments without voice-motivated grounding. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable; Elena's perceptual signature (provenance researcher's idiom, plant-listening, coffee-reading) is distinct and purposeful. Diction remains within her lexicon; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—rushed syntax at the bow-lift. Psychic distance shifts intentionally. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate ("gossamer veil," "radiant hush," "iridescent shadows"), consistent with a lyric register but occasionally slipping into stock phrasing ("profound privilege," "sacred nature"). Perceptual signature is present (seeing patterns in static, beautician's trained eye) but not character-specific enough to feel irreplaceable. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is controlled; the voice modulates little under the single sustained tone.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct contemplative register. Perceptual signature is consistent (mist, clouds, light, silence). The prose modulates effectively between action ("climbed higher than she ever had") and reflection without head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the continuous, sacred act of arriving") that feels authorial rather than character-organic. No dialogue present to assess, appropriately for the solitary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and profession-specific: "sincerely insincere patience," "cloak of doubt," "unhook her thoughts." Perceptual signature is consistent (she notices chime patterns, reads emotional frequencies). However, the final third slips into elevated diction that borders on promotional copy ("a place where certainty came to be questioned and questions came to find their answers, one fragile dawn at a time"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose reads as one consciousness, but the meta-commentary in the ending weakens voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds stable; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. Diction is elevated but consistent: "ancient pattern," "eternal hush," "quality of wind through old trees." The researcher's speech carries distinct formality ("Vanishing is not what you imagine") contrasted with Mina's physical grounding. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "dimension where opposites reconciled" and "process—a dimension" introduce abstract-philosophical vocabulary mid-pressure that edges outside immediate perception, though it coheres with the contemplative voice. No head-hopping; focalization remains with Mina throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: geological time, reverent patience, sensory expansion through the pulse. Diction ("historically reverent," "canyon of endless echoes") is voice-motivated and consistent. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "sensed") are frequent but voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy. Narrative distance modulates purposefully with her expanding awareness. No head-hopping or unmotivated shifts; free indirect style is clean. Minor penalty for elevated register ("appraised its weight and balance ten thousand times") that occasionally drifts above the character's lived lexicon under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with tight psychic distance: "Mira found it beautiful in the way that forgotten things are beautiful." Perceptual signature (functional geometry, "automated processes") reflects her mage-maintenance role. Diction stays character-apt—"liminal spaces," "ward calibration"—without register drift. The prose modulates cleanly from procedural calm ("calibrating the boundary wards") to wonder ("mist simply accepted her"). No dialogue; interiority carries the arc. Brief hedge ("seemed almost intentional," "as if") fits the tentative discovery mode.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable single limited-third, anchored in Elias's perceptual signature: "light left fingerprints," "luminescence in the dark," "cathedral hush." Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent, fitting the contemplative mode. Distance control is clean—no head-hopping, no unearned omniscience. However, several lines lean toward overwriting that flattens propulsion: "the kind of silence that held more meaning than noise ever could" tells rather than trusts the image. Filter verbs ("he understood," "he was beginning to understand") recur in high-pressure beats where direct perception would sharpen impact. Psychic distance remains appropriate, but the elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("by becoming the kind of man who wandered purposefully") that dilutes the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("隐藏" character insertion reads as artifact or intentional multilingual flourish—unclear). Perceptual signature is consistent (filtering through scientific vs. intuitive frameworks). However, the prose occasionally slips into expository mode, particularly when explaining the grandmother's philosophy. Psychic distance remains appropriate, and the focalization never leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("alchemy of their final weeks," "small creature surfacing"), creating a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Melencolia's contemplative distance. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the naming, pulled back for scene anchoring). Some phrases edge toward stock lyricism ("hollow chest," "stone dropped into deep water"), but the voice holds under pressure and the final cadence charges the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on the mage; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is clear: he notices dripping rates, fracture patterns, and patient accumulation, filtered through his modest self-assessment. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "patient accumulation"), though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("belied his failing strength," "cosmic imbalance"). No head-hopping. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("the steady application of something modest and persistent, exactly as the dripping rates had taught him") reads as helpful-narrator syndrome, tilting toward reader assistance rather than trusting the dramatized image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Elara's professional lens: "trained to read water's intentions the way others read faces." Diction is controlled and elevated—"the great expunge of names and histories," "mirrored hush," "crystalline clarity"—fitting a literary register. Two slips harm the score: "precisely humane details" is awkwardly abstract, and the phrase "the reservoir spoke in a language she had not heard since childhood" is somewhat generic. The final paragraph's "when the waters rose again—and they always rose again—the stories would remain above the surface" feels like helpful narrator rather than Elara's embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance and a distinct elevated register ("kaleidoscopic," "liminal space," "architecture of magic"). Perceptual signature reflects Mira's scientific training filtered through emotional opening ("quiet reverence"). However, diction occasionally drifts into prompty abstraction ("touch of wonder," "harmony emerged naturally from chaos") that feels narrated rather than inhabited. Psychic distance and focalization remain clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct professional idiom: "noctilucent observatory," "midnight pattern seeker," wind vectors and pressure systems. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (white knuckles) to distant (observing cloud formations). However, diction occasionally drifts into essayistic register—"the watcher's burden made manifest," "acknowledgment of duty fulfilled"—that reads more like retrospective narration than present perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the perceptual signature (post-ego-death flatness vs. remembered warmth) is character-particular. Diction elevates appropriately for the ceremonial dojo setting. The clone's dialogue "You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence" and the protagonist's thesis-speak in the final paragraph ("complementary opposites… transformation occurs") drift into essay register during peak beats, reducing voice distinctness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrator claims "he understood" and "he had learned" without showing the contradictions or limits that would ground interiority. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calcified around this household's heart," "acoustic memory") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—what this conductor notices could belong to any caretaker archetype. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent throughout, though the register ("interiorized exteriors," "foggy lucidity," "generous boundary of light") often drifts into academic abstraction unsuited to a feral guardian's lived experience. Perceptual signature is present (pages tangled in hair, luminescent eyes) but undermined by over-articulate philosophical interiority. Psychic distance remains close but voice lacks contradiction or grit under pressure; syntax is uniformly elaborate across emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Mara's perception filtered through alchemical language ("vivify," "catalyst," "successive approximation"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (wider for backstory, tighter for the climactic moment). However, several constructions drift into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-native: "beguile death itself," "with stoic sensitivity," "irrevocably interrupted" stack Latinate abstractions that sit uneasily beside her weathered hands and mountain setting. The final paragraph's syntax ("had created destruction and destroyed creation") reads as authorial summation rather than Mara's perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature—filtered through Mara's interpretive training—is distinct ("frequencies jumped and danced," "shard of hush," "serenely electric"). Diction remains consistent with her technical background. However, the phrase "fantasy being simply survival" in the penultimate paragraph drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-grounded, and "the fundamental rhythm that governed all things" repeats a conceptual register that flattens voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (measuring "by the quality of silence between stars") is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure: "the nexus, the point where parallel timelines could touch and recognize themselves" and "universe shudder and sigh" read more lyric-abstract than grounded in Maren's working deckhand idiom. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she could see") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose. No head-hopping; single-POV focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with high psychic intimacy. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices geometric shifts, phosphorescence trails, the singing of thread—sensory hierarchy filtered through her expertise. Diction remains controlled ("liminal space between the natural and the constructed," "tessellated grid," "neurological pathways") without register drift; these terms fit her profession. Purposeful compression in "as memories alter" and the eruption paragraph creates cadence shifts that support accumulative pressure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira throughout, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a meditative, specific texture ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel") that modulates appropriately across the descent, dialogue with Dr. Chen, and calculation scene. The single exchange with Dr. Chen is natural and purposeful, revealing character through what is said and unsaid about the anchor link. Minor elevation into philosophical register ("invisible threads," "the infinite") reads slightly above a working instructor's mid-scene lexicon under stress, but the perceptual signature—Mira filtering setting and event through navigation metaphors—is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elena. Voice carries elevated diction ("negotiations between worlds," "liminal hour," "moth wings against glass") that feels consistent but occasionally drifts above a working contact tracer's likely register. Vera's whispered line and the hearing-aid message carry subtext, but Elena's interior stays smooth and analytical even at the climactic turn. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (grief softened, shadows pooled, impossible lightness) is consistent, though not always character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"green-dark water," "copper arteries"—that reflects Maren's academic background under pressure. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The final paragraph's register shifts slightly elevated ("dissolution of boundaries," "gentle dissolution") but remains legible as voice-motivated compression of a transformative moment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is controlled and distinct, with a lyric register that matches the twilight setting and reflective stance. Diction remains consistent within Mira's lexicon, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. However, filter verbs ("understood," "felt") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. The architect's "transmission" is narrated through summary rather than perception, reducing embodied specificity in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct lyric register: "the dust of forgotten pronunciations," "texture of feeling and the architecture of meaning." Psychic distance is stable. The phrase "quietly articulate" appears twice in close proximity, and elevated diction ("liminal moment," "helix of meaning") occasionally drifts from visceral immediacy during high-pressure beats. Elara's perceptual signature—focusing on patterns, sounds, textures—is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a speculative-literary register ("harmony untamed," "frostbitten hope," "cosmic humor") that fits the cryptid-research frame but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("manifestation of pure metamorphosis," "symphony of untamed nature"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Amari's phone-transmitted lines pursue subtext ("bitterness is just cosmic humor that hasn't found its punchline yet"). Psychic distance compresses cleanly during the garden shift. Minor filter-verb clusters ("felt herself rising," "heard in faculty meetings") dull immediacy in two beats but do not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person close on Elara. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("syncopating," "tarnished wonder"). However, psychic distance drifts into omniscience when the narrator claims the statues "had once been musicians" without dramatizing how Elara knows this. The interior voice occasionally slips into thesis-speak ("the gap between knowing and understanding") that feels imposed rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Marcus's perceptual signature—his mailman's pragmatism and practiced neutrality—reads consistently. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the boy's trembling hands and simple request feel natural, and Marcus's quiet "Tell your grandmother the storm is coming" carries subtext. However, several lines drift into elevated, abstract diction detached from Marcus's immediate perception: "healing required medicine and metaphor in equal measure" and "quiet proof that even in disputed territories, promises could still be kept" read as authorial summary rather than the working thoughts of a man mid-delivery. Filter verbs ("he had learned," "Marcus recognized") are appropriately sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a lyric, meditative cadence throughout. Perceptual signature ("hands that knew wood the way others knew words") is character-specific and consistent. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("interpreting silence as possibility") that feels more authorial than carpenter-bound, reducing voice integrity under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interior at the singing moment, wider frame at closure). No dialogue to assess. One Chinese phrase fragment ("不需要言語的寂静中") disrupts idiom without clear motivation or POV anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct and confident, blending scientific precision ("hyperbolic space," "optical illusions") with poetic cadence ("observed solitude," "the weight of accumulated narratives"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third around Miriam, and diction fits her decades of eccentric scholarship. The woman's brief dialogue carries reverence appropriate to the moment. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "analog memories that lived in every binding and marginalia," which edges toward essay rather than lived perception, but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Mira notices marginalia, water damage, "the quality of being" rather than person or place). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cipher of longing revealed itself slowly," "the evidence of dreams that had been dreamed and then lost"). The prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("sheer persistence and the willingness to work when others would not") but mostly stays anchored in Mira's patient, cataloguing intelligence. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between concrete action and reflection, though the reflection-heavy final third tests the reader's trust in present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the locksmith; psychic distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("surrendered to horizon," "hush of cosmic possibility," "membrane separating"), which fits a fabulist register but occasionally drifts into abstract phrasing ("saturated with unspoken things," "permeable to wonder"). Perceptual signature is present—patient, interpretive—but voice does not modulate under pressure; the locksmith's interiority at discovery reads as calm summary rather than embodied shift. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and non-standard cadence are consistent and legible, fitting an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—folklorist's cataloging eye, archival habits—is consistent. However, several lines drift into elevated diction that feels imported rather than character-native: "crisp nostalgia of remembered love," "chronically curious become converts," and "mysteries remain" read as thematic summation rather than in-scene thought. Free indirect style generally works, but the final paragraph's declarative tone ("he knew now") distances the reader from embodied interiority at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV (Maren) holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction shows purposeful compression ("combative tenderness," "warrior's acknowledgment") that fits an archivist-mentor voice. However, several phrases lean toward elevated register that feels imposed rather than organic ("the particular haunted look of those who had lost everything except their own heartbeats," "the spatial poetry of scattered fragments"). Dialogue is minimal and functional; Maren's "Tea" and exile speech carry subtext but the children remain silent, limiting voice distinction tests.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Elara's elevated, archaic register ("liquid silver," "liminal space," "covenant"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor register drift: "insatiably creative" and "places that were slipping away" feel like authorial summary rather than Elara's lived perception. Perceptual signature is present (silence between leaves, conversations roots hold) but compression at peak beats ("feeling its weight and warmth") could embody more contradiction or embodied sensation under the moment's claimed gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register throughout—"interlaced hush," "accumulated silence," "lucid unrest" feel voice-consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature (light as bent/fractured, silence as thick, spirit as shimmer) is coherent. However, diction occasionally drifts into high literary generality ("she understood now," "some truths") that flattens immediacy at peak beats. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure the through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual filter ("reading the spaces between places," "followed silence rather than sound"). However, the diction frequently elevates into academic register ("methodically curious," "shielded openness," "perceptive map framer") that reads as external characterization rather than Elena's lived idiom under pressure. The prose maintains consistent narrative distance but lacks rhythmic modulation at the closure; the final paragraph stacks abstraction ("reverence," "acknowledged," "memory") where concrete image would sharpen the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable (limited third, Miriam), and the voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "the amber silence of the ocean floor," "the sophisticated melancholy of the message." Diction remains within Miriam's scholarly, introspective register throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the accumulated mass of every search, every hypothesis") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The final image is clean, but the line "the physics of letting go was not about abandonment but about trust" feels slightly expository for the POV's immersed state.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized tightly through Mira's balladeer sensibility. Perceptual signature is consistent: she hears melody in light patterns, "driftingly alert," attuned to frequencies and vibrations. Diction is lyric and elevated ("liminal place where earth dissolved into ether") without register breaks, voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains close; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure (calm encoding → urgency "between lightning and thunder" → sung climax). One minor slip: "theink" appears to be a typo for "the ink," briefly disrupting immersion, but voice coherence and distance control otherwise meet high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a clear perceptual signature: Mira notices "the groans of the old airship" and filters light through her context ("warmly inquisitive by nature"). Psychic distance modulates cleanly as emotion rises. However, two sentence-opening patterns recur heavily: "The [noun]" openers (brass elevator, entries, elevator again, observation deck doors) and participial constructions ("wondering if," "feeling as though") that create mild template cadence. The voice remains coherent and the POV is modesty-controlled, but the syntactic uniformity slightly dulls the rhythmic variation expected at 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates appropriately with Miriam's reflection. Perceptual signature is distinct (scientific observer filtering through grief). However, elevated diction ("categorizing the formations not by their scientific designations but by the emotions they seemed to embody") occasionally drifts into expository register that flattens urgency. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices patterns and textures more than faces, the bark better than any introduction. Diction stays elevated but coherent ("fractally precise," "heightened stillness") and matches the scholarly milieu. However, psychic distance occasionally drifts toward narrative summary rather than embodied perception, particularly in the guild backstory paragraph. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solitary nocturnal task.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and textured: "sociable isolation," "stranded luminance," "mesmerizing...coordination" all feel character-particular. Perceptual signature is clear—Mira notices geometric patterns, measures intervals, cross-references notes. The brief dialogue with Bren is natural and goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean, and diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon (cartographer's apprentice, three years of training). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks detract from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("lunar-eclipse locksmith," "solidified mist"). However, perceptual signature is weak—Thessa's noticing feels generic-poetic rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into writerly showcase ("umbral embrace," "tattooed on her soul") that sits above the character's lived moment. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. Psychic distance is controlled, but the narrator's voice lacks the idiosyncratic grain that would distinguish this from other fantasy-lyric pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person omniscient POV maintains stable distance and a lyric, fairy-tale register ("gentle giants of gnarled trunk," "something ineffable kept watch"). Focalization is controlled; no head-hopping mid-paragraph. Diction is consistent and purpose-driven, though occasionally elevated ("ineffable," "nebula of respite") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is absent. The narrative voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled, modulating from mystery (opening) to warmth (ending) without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric, elevated, and consistent throughout; diction and rhythm create a singular texture. POV distance is stable, and perceptual signature (mechanical beauty, reverence for flawed objects) is character-specific. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Under peak pressure (the final adjustment), the voice maintains its tone without compression or modulation; this consistency serves the Accumulative lens but sacrifices dynamic range. Filter verbs ("she could see," "she understood") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices texture, weight, and the "method her grandmother had taught her" through embodied practice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the nut examination, pulling back slightly for the labyrinth overview. Diction stays consistent ("offhandedly exact," "reluctant heart") with a slightly elevated, myth-inflected register that fits the cursed-ground premise. The prose compresses under pressure: "shuddered once, twice, then began to assemble" accelerates rhythm at the closure beat. One minor note: "flesh-and-blood intruders" in paragraph two reads slightly external to Mira's established idiom, a fleeting register bump that doesn't recur.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: molecular metaphors ("polymer chain of grief"), professional diction ("surfactants," "biodegradable packaging"), and the filtering of landscape through chemistry. Voice modulates appropriately—technical precision in calm beats, looser syntax under emotional weight ("Don't you dare feel guilty about this"). Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance tightens at key moments (the microscope weeping scene). One minor slip: "The pieces fall into place" in the penultimate paragraph briefly narrows distance with a generic idiom rather than staying in Miriam's idiolect, but recovery is swift and the ending image restores her voice fully.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice sustains a lyric, meditative register with purposeful compression ("Incise by quantifying absence") and patterned diction. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the raw materials of creation, pieces of potential narratives held in suspended animation") that slightly exceeds the vendor's practical idiom under contemplative pressure. Perceptual signature is present—she notices gaps, absences, negative space—but rhythmic modulation under pressure is limited; the cadence remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and narrative distance modulates with Miriam's focus (close during touch, slightly pulled back during the three-day montage). Diction is generally controlled, though occasional phrases ("at the close of an unspoken dream") introduce mild register drift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (scholar-chef lens reading formations and flavors). The final paragraph's "sturdy brittle quality" leans abstract but remains within the established voice. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (Elara's perspective filtering community history through the library's lens) is present. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gravitational pull of community needs," "celestial predictions") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Dialogue is minimal and functional; when present, it advances goals but lacks subtext or naturalism that would distinguish voices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV control is clean throughout; Mira's perceptual signature (helix-minded, recursive loops) is asserted in voice. Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose texture ("chaotically precise movements," "synaptic plasticity") attempts character-specific diction. However, register drifts into abstract clinical language during peak transformation beats ("synaptic pathways reorganize," "neural pathways that integrated") rather than embodied perception. The final paragraph's elevated diction ("imprints of all who had passed through it, their abandoned dreams rising like ghosts") maintains narrative stance but leans toward summary rather than immediate image. No head-hopping, and focalization stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Calyx; psychic distance and tense remain consistent. Voice carries elevated, archivist-specific diction ("gossamer," "clandestinely luminous," "serpentined"), though some phrases trend purple ("latent blaze," "sprolved into bloom"). Perceptual signature is present: she reads mist as letters, sees knowledge as spectrum. Free indirect style is clean. Register is consistent but occasionally strained by metaphor density in high-pressure moments (the stone-press climax).

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: she notices "patterns that spoke to her," reads stress cracks as "nodes," and interprets sound as "offering to something that needed to hear." Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching the protagonist's artistic sensibility without register drift. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance remains consistent, and free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "the world had decided to listen" in the opening risks slight omniscience, but recovers quickly to Elara's frame. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats, and the perceptual filter remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the tutor filters experience through chess precision and magnetic metaphor. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("thoughtfully precise," "eclipsed covenant"). However, the prose drifts into elevated, abstract register during peak reflection ("the most profound teachings lived not in what was spoken but in what was waited for"), creating slight distance from embodied urgency. No dialogue present. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats, but filter-verb stacks ("he had come to understand," "he had learned") appear in the final third, applying a −0.3 penalty in Q7 rather than here.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is profession-specific (auditory details, frequency language). Psychic distance is controlled, and diction fits Mira's contemplative stance. Prose rhythm is measured and lyric, appropriate to the accumulative design. However, register drifts into abstractions ("theatrical sincerity," "architecture of honesty," "emotional register") that feel more authorial than character-native, especially under the modest urgency of a stuck clasp. No dialogue present to assess. The voice is distinct but smooths over moments that could show stress-driven compression or sensory narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kalia; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during sensory overwhelm, slightly elevated during reflection). Perceptual signature is herbalist-olfactory: "elderflower sap," "undercurrent of wisdom," "purple-black like a bruise healing." Dialogue with Sholomi carries subtext ("turning of the tide's thought") without over-explaining. The prose texture is lyric-leaning with purposeful compression ("serenity within motion"), though some diction stretches plausibility for a young herbalist under pressure ("olfactorily sensitive nature transformed from burden to gift" reads slightly elevated). Elder Sholomi's speech is distinct but brief. Internal voice remains coherent across emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in technical filters ("resonance signature," "moorings") and selective attention to water flow and arches. Voice modulates appropriately from analytic observation to wonder. One weakness: some diction edges into elevated register during peak moments—"gathering of echoes began then, voices rising from the artifact like steam from heated stone"—that slightly distances from immediate perception. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Mira's professional lens coloring all perception (wreckage diagrams, anemometer deployment, "air left fingerprints"). Diction is controlled and technical without register breaks. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"the fog had settled over the port like a held breath," "sterile space"—that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks idiosyncratic texture; Mira's way of noticing reads competent-investigator rather than a singular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (synesthetic color-vision) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and lyric ("prism-song bell ringer," "drink in the auroral light") but remains internally coherent without mid-beat register clashes. However, the prose occasionally slips into abstract poeticism ("water finding its level," "light through glass") that flattens specificity under peak pressure, and the sculptor interlude interrupts Yara's focalization without clear spatial or perceptual anchoring, creating a brief distance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable single-third with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kira notices relics, lineages, and patterns with a cataloger's precision ("selecting them with the same care she had once used when cataloging artifacts"). Diction remains character-specific and voice-motivated throughout. However, two issues lower the score: the phrase "avalanchingly quiet determination" in the opening line is awkward and self-consciously literary, breaking naturalism; and the narration occasionally over-explains what has been shown ("This was where the Weaving had first manifested… where Kira had stood frozen for three heartbeats too long"). Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and no filter-verb stacks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (amber light as "condition of perception," emotions as mathematics) is consistent and purposeful. The prose carries a distinct lyric-intellectual texture, and non-standard compression ("The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity") is pattern-taught and legible. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("transposed empathy," "emotional signatures," "interior architecture") that, while voice-motivated, risks register mismatch with embodied scene work. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with strong perceptual signature ("the cold seeping through her bones—but it didn't hurt. It felt right, the way a key feels right in a lock"). Psychic distance modulates effectively between close interiority and atmospheric sweep. Minor slips: "across the fade from memory to myth" is repeated as both frame and phrase without evolving meaning, and Mira's dialogue ("Everything I taught you is still in there") edges toward workshop-speak rather than voice-specific idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's syntactic uniformity (three "was still" clauses in succession) creates template cadence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinctive: Mira notices crystalline code, "the condensation of feeling made visible in cold," and "the architecture of the world itself." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that strains plausibility for a mystic alone at dawn: "truthful lies she told herself were more bearable than the probable truths others would offer" reads slightly over-articulated for internal thought under the inferred stance. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, but the heightened register in peak beats (e.g., "emotional archaeology") slightly undermines immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV distance is stable (close third), but the voice drifts into elevated register ("loom's heddles clicking in rhythm with her heartbeat," "raveling silence accelerated") that reads more like narrated atmosphere than the spinner's perceptual signature. Psychic distance widens at key moments: "she understood now" and "the truth she had been weaving toward" are narrator-assisted epiphanies. No dialogue to evaluate. Internal voice lacks specificity—her way of noticing bamboo, amber, or puzzle edges is generic rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is attempted but inconsistent, sliding into summary when pressure should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with a deliberate, contemplative cadence that suits the retrospective frame. Diction is controlled—"azure defiance," "scrabbled for survival," "frivolous thing"—and perceptual signature is maintained (Cael notices weight, texture, resonance). However, distance occasionally wavers: "He had kept it simply because it was beautiful" reads as external summary rather than interior texture under pressure. No dialogue appears; focalization is stable throughout. The prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("Let others claim…") that addresses the reader rather than tracking Cael's thought.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and textured with a distinct perceptual signature: Kira notices "the particular quality of longing that accumulated in spaces where many had passed through without looking back." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the shimmer encounter. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose carries a contemplative, archaeological texture that matches the sensory mapper's lens. One slip: the climactic sentence beginning "The shimmer deepened, and the air filled with the murmur of half-remembered dreams—her dreams, his dreams, the dreams of all the travelers..." shifts into slightly elevated register that strains the established voice under peak pressure, but the effect is minor and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Maren's perceptual filter (barnacles shifting, gulls' storm calls) establishes her observational idiom early. "Luminescent ache" and "breathing thing" fog are purposeful texture. However, lines like "the method of communication that transcended life and death" and "bottle the feeling of safety" drift toward elevated summary that exceeds Maren's taciturn voice under pressure. Ashford's brief dialogue feels functional but not distinctly voiced. Distance control holds; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression ("dream remembering itself," "held breath"). POV distance is stable; the keeper's perceptual bias filters all detail. Rhythmic control modulates with intensity, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice occasionally slips into abstraction ("purpose distilled," "invisible hand") that dilutes immediacy in peak beats, preventing entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature rooted in Yuen's dye-master vocabulary ("colors that revealed themselves only when ready," "iridescent caution"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though some phrases ("valley-mist wonder," "living archives of human wonder") tilt toward elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds the focalizer's practical lexicon under peak reflection. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The reflective mode is clean and anchored to the present stimulus (the wing).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature is consistent ("weather had carved rivers," "trees remember"), and diction matches the warden's professional lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider vista. However, elevated register occasionally intrudes: "repository of human sorrow," "hourglass that stretches back to the first wall" read more essayistic than embodied. No dialogue to evaluate. Under stress, the prose remains poised rather than fragmenting, which fits the warden's calm but slightly dulls urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in limited third with Elara as focalizer. The perceptual signature is present but generic (luminescent trees, withered leaves, ghostly phosphorescence). Diction suffers from elevated register that distances the reader: "the accumulating weight of absence," "the deeper current of feeling," "threads of melody that no one had sung in centuries." Under peak stress (the climax), the prose maintains the same ornate texture rather than compressing or shifting rhythm to reflect urgency. Several filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "glimpsed") dull immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with clear psychic distance and a distinct reflective register ("the paradox was nestled within her like a Russian doll"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular, though elevated phrasing ("enlarged tranquility," "wisdom the way other people collected stamps") occasionally drifts from immediate embodied perception. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose maintains coherence under the reflective mode, and the final image sustains the established tone without rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature rooted in her attention to "creeping normality" and decay. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("heuristically gentle," "guerrilla gardening"). Some phrases edge toward elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "ordinary persistence") that risks slipping outside her plausible lexicon during peak beats, but the effect remains legible and consistent. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is controlled, with a consistent register of elevated, precise diction ("quartz hush," "luminous vows," "surgically precise movements"). POV remains stable in close third, filtering perception through the archivist's trained attention. However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("This was the edge of oblivion that she had been dreading") and the interiority leans abstract rather than embodied. The perceptual signature is present but could be more distinctly character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Mara's perceptual signature filters the market through inherited knowledge ("familiar planks," "unwritten laws"). The prose carries distinct texture: "the truce of hush," "comforting unease," "steadfast" as a lodged splinter. Voice modulates appropriately as pressure builds, tightening around the final exchange. The Chinese phrase for the watch fob description is unmotivated by POV and breaks immersion, reading as ornamental code-switching rather than character-driven perception. Dialogue is minimal but functional, the woman's cryptic response fitting the market's atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("herbaceous scent," "terrestrially cosmic hue," "clouds" in a smile) that fits the atmospheric design. Filter verbs ("understood," "found") appear but remain voice-motivated. The dialogue between Mira and Seren is functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit; both characters speak in equally elevated, explanatory cadences. Perceptual signature is present (taste, luminescence) but the prose at peak beats (Seren's arrival) relies on stock metaphor ("voice carrying an undertone that might have been distant thunder").

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single first-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's mnemonically gifted cataloging ("the manufacturer, the weight, the way the failsafe never properly engaged") and technical lens color her observations. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional elevated phrases ("auroral sorrow," "womb of crystallized light") drift slightly above casual interior register. Filter verbs are present but voice-motivated. Elena's quoted line ("Hold onto this... when you're ready to uncork your own creativity") carries natural idiom. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Mira's calligrapher's perception ("gossamer sheets her canvas," "gold her commitment to permanence"). Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional elevated register ("candor lived in small moments," "pilgrimage to honesty") reads slightly above her embodied voice under pressure. The師傅 reference uses Chinese characters (師傅) without translation, which is purposeful but creates momentary opacity for some readers. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the plate examination, pulling back for the journey), and no head-hopping occurs. The perceptual signature—attention to texture, gold, and inscription—remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric-leaning texture with elevated diction ("blue as preserved midnight," "silence not a lack but a fullness") that fits the reflective, post-verbal world. Psychic distance is consistent, and perceptual filtering reflects Elara's tuner background. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("she understood that her motivation had been fulfilled") and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the thematic payoff. Free indirect style is clean when used; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV held cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Cara notices through both machine precision ("nutrient regulators," "emotional processors") and organic metaphor ("veins of a shared circulation"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("diffuse...scattered across the frequency spectrum") that feels slightly imposed. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the miniaturization sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Some phrases ("fragmented wholeness," "something like clarity") edge toward conceptual summary rather than embodied perception under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Elena's curatorial sensibility. The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful rhythm: "that paradoxical quality of intense quiet where everything feels suspended between moments." However, psychic distance occasionally slips into summary omniscience—"Through neighborhood storytelling, Elena learned"—that tells rather than dramatizes discovery. Mrs. Okonkwo's brief dialogue feels natural, though her exposition-heavy speech borders on convenient information delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct rhythm ("the patience of someone who had learned that pressure shapes rather than breaks"). Free indirect style is clean, and Mira's perceptual signature—interpreting movement as language—remains stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("architecture of movement itself," "lyrical code breaker") that risks abstraction. Two untranslated foreign terms ("方向盘," "神经系统") disrupt the English POV without voice motivation; they read as artifacts rather than purposeful code-switching. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, though the register ("liminal spaces between sea and shore," "memories that gravity itself could not reach") occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism that flattens urgency. Perceptual signature is present (Mira notices salt, coffee patterns, the gleam of crystals) but not character-specific; another character might perceive identically. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains constant, appropriate for the reflective accumulative mode, but does not modulate with pressure because pressure is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice sustains a distinct, elevated register with consistent lyricism ("ghost-motes," "latticework," "braille made of absence"). POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through the summoner's philosophical lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("the terrestrially cosmic truth," "the mapping of silence as cartographers once mapped stars") that feels imposed rather than organically character-rooted. The single POV is clean with no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains controlled, but the uniform texture lacks modulation under the ritual's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elena's architectural-student perception. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, and free-indirect moments ("Wasn't it possible to know someone entirely through the architecture they inhabited…?") land cleanly. However, some diction drifts into elevated register during emotional beats ("the membrane between what was real and what was merely true") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful. The tutor's "some signatures are made by the living and some by the spaces between them" reads as thematic shorthand rather than natural speech. Perceptual signature is present but could be more distinctly Elena's rather than generically lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose carries a distinct texture with controlled elevation ("the sky itself were bleeding into the earth," "suggestions of language carried in frequencies"). POV remains stable in close third with Mira's perceptual signature (scientist's lens, skepticism as armor). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the architecture of bone and memory") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The narrative voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to emotional resonance as the garden darkens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Yuki. Perceptual signature is present in the lyrical diction ("pearl twilight," "calibrated treason"), though the voice occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The Archive Keeper's dialogue is minimal but functional. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose texture is consistent. However, filter verbs and abstract constructions ("what her grandmother called," "she understood immediately") dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara hears layered frequencies, notices sound transformations, filters the world through acoustic metaphor. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close at seashell moment, widening for backstory). Diction remains elevated and consistent ("serpentine nexus," "canyon echo singer") with no head-hopping. Register is lyric-literary throughout; no dialogue to test voice distinction. Reflection anchors to present stimuli (seashell, starlight, hum).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, with a distinctive lyric texture ("borrowed starlight," "cathedral ribs," "fallings of gentle snow"), but the diction often drifts into ornamental abstraction disconnected from the POV's embodied experience. Perceptual signature is weak—her way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific, and elevated phrasing like "weaving truth carefully from fragments strangers carried in their dreams" feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Backstory dominates (roughly 60% reflection on prior investigation) without interleaving present micro-choices that alter options, flattening momentum. The psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is distinct: Yuki notices "invisible threads," "moon paths stretched…like silver stitching," "scintillatingly somber flashes"—language filtered through her philosopher-mender lens. Diction elevates but stays character-consistent (e.g., "demure audacity" reads as narratorial color matching her worldview). No dialogue; no second character on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from embodied perception (cool stone, bamboo weight) to reflective summary. One minor slip: "scintillatingly somber" feels like authorial color rather than Yuki's own phrasing under pressure (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance contracts smoothly during the keeper's dialogue and expands for the weeks of reconstruction. Diction is controlled and specific ("radiation mapping," "stillpoint of calm"). The orchard keeper's voice carries distinct idiom ("Same thing, if you understand what's been hidden here"). Minor register drift: "metastasized" and "co-opted into a dozen competing mythologies" push toward elevated abstraction at odds with the narrator's investigative voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and a consistent lyric register. Diction is elevated and voice-specific ("ephemeral light," "boiled below her like a grey ocean catching fire"). Perceptual signature shows Elara filtering storm and static through scientific/mystical synthesis. However, peak-pressure lines lean into overwriting: "throat about to sing," "flower made of static and lightning," "figure made of storm and starlight" stack figurative language without crisp propulsion. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose carries a consistent lyric-reflective voice with distinctive cadence ("dawn's earliest whistle," "lonesome splendor," "the patient work of years"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. The retrospective frame ("as he would later learn," "Years later, when the poets of the new generation asked him") is voice-motivated and legible, though it sacrifices immediacy. No dialogue appears; the granddaughter's arrival is summarized without spoken exchange, a missed opportunity for subtext and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's mind filters the world through vibrational mathematics and familial duty. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated (e.g., "sonic absolution," "temple of ice," "logically emotional"). Free indirect style is clean, and narrative certainty matches what Maren can plausibly know. However, phrases like "holy," "sacred artifact," and "eternal song" drift toward elevated register in peak beats without full dramatization, creating slight texture strain. No dialogue is present; voice remains singular and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent elevated register ("unyoke," "restrained wildness," "softly purposeful"). Distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("revolution was never measured in seasons alone") and the prose relies on stock poetic gestures ("silver fire," "ancient beast from an era before names"). One typo: "andshifted" (paragraph 3) disrupts flow at a key sensory beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance and Elena's investigative filter shaping perception (wear patterns, sediment accumulation, angle of rib cage). The sudden shift to omniscient access during the memory transfer ("His name surfaced unbidden: Thomas Wright, a civil rights archivist...") disrupts focalization without establishing this as Elena's documented capability. Diction is mostly character-appropriate though "entangled memories" and "resonated with the memories embedded in these walls" drift toward abstract concept-speak. Rhythm modulates effectively between clinical observation and the pressured final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable; Thomas's perceptual signature—noticing light shifts "in ways that reminded him of confessionals," tools as ritual objects—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Thomas's internal voice: "the vibrant hush of concentration settling around him like a second skin" and "aptly deliberate" read as imposed descriptors. The woman's dialogue is absent, limiting voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, though psychic distance remains uniform across beats rather than modulating with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: syntactic density, recursive phrasing ("the way tides pull… the way gravity pulls"), and a mechanical-philosophical idiom create a strong perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflective mode. Minor slips: a few constructions ("if Tuesdays meant anything," "if hours were measured") lean slightly toward explanatory hedge rather than confident assertion, and one filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("had been built… had developed… had discovered") mildly dulls immediacy without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (Maren notices patterns, numbers, and archival residue). Distance control is generally clean, though phrases like "brightly attentive nature" and "sensed absence that had followed her through eleven years" read as external labels rather than interior texture. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("the particular silence that echoed louder than the songs") without clear motivation from Maren's voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Focalization holds without head-hopping, and the narrative stance supports the accumulative-mystery tone.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: "the salt that dried into their skin from years of sea wind," "the weighted breath before reply when everything was still possible." Psychic distance remains stable; diction fits Mira's reflective cast. Minor slippage: "she understood instinctively" tells certainty the prose could show, and "courageous anomaly of her nature" reads slightly external. No dialogue present; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: "grips reality loosely," "trawl through the shallows with the others, dragging her consciousness." Psychic distance is stable; the actuary detail and grandmother backstory anchor in present stimuli. The prose modulates effectively from clinical precision ("calculating the precise mathematics of risk and ending") to lyric compression ("windborne solace"). A few filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated. The final turn maintains interior texture without head-hopping or sudden register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent register blending Elias's rural occupation and meditative bent. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("twisted trunks," "brittle surrender of decades-old grief"). One slip: the Chinese characters (她, 编织ing) break immersion and read as text artifacts rather than voice-motivated choices. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and reflective summary. No dialogue is present; interiority remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated perceptual signature ("the seeing done not by looking directly," "whisperfield calm"). Diction is controlled and poetic, matched to the contemplative register. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("felt recognition," "echo of wisdom") where concrete embodiment would sharpen interiority. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice texture is purposeful, though the meditative register flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature (patient archivist's gaze) is consistent and voice carries a distinct lyric-contemplative texture. Diction ("梯形 traces," "vines climb") includes unexplained non-English and occasional register drift ("transmutation," "perceptively calm") that reads slightly elevated for the established voice. Under peak reflection (final paragraph), the prose shifts into abstract philosophical register without embodied anchor, diluting immediacy. No head-hopping; elision is minimal and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated scholarly diction ("lexicographical endeavour," "reticent scholars do not explain their compulsions") matched to Elias's forty-three-year tenure. Perceptual signature is consistent—attention to patterns, proportions, sequences. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close ("He did not know why") to wider reflection. One minor register inconsistency: the Chinese character "螺纹" appears mid-sentence without explanation or integration, reading as a typographical artifact rather than a motivated code-switch in Elias's English-language interiority. Free indirect style is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct lyric register ("junkyard prophet," "precognitively forgetful"). Perceptual signature is strong: Mira notices "the architecture of abandonment" and hears "the particular resonance...somewhere between the creak of a house settling and the soft collapse of something giving up its hope." However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond plausible immediate interiority under the story's contemplative pressure—phrases like "tidal longing rising and falling in her chest like something born from the ocean of time itself" read more as authorial poeticism than character-specific thought, creating minor register tension in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters the world through mechanisms, geometry, and light. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous ache," "ephemeral light of meteor showers"), fitting a reflective sage. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure—shorter clauses during the tremor, then expansive reflection at closure. One minor issue: a brief Chinese character intrusion ("ancient脾气") breaks immersion and reads as a generation artifact rather than a purposeful code-switch. Filter verbs ("I understand," "I realize") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent for a reflective narrator; they do not dull immediacy in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization through Elara is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices light, objects, and breath rhythms through her professional lens. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Margery's "You brought your junk drawer again" and "You're not just humming" carry subtext and advance the relational beat. Diction elevates at times ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness") in ways that feel slightly imposed rather than fully character-particular under stress, though the elevated register remains legible and consistent. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates gently with the ritual's intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV, third-limited, stable distance. Perceptual signature: "her fingers brushed," "she realized with a shiver," filters align with a deliberate scholar's attention. Diction is elevated and consistent ("residual magic," "adjacent reality") without register breaks. No dialogue to assess. The key phrase "sealed awakenings" recurs purposefully. Psychic distance remains controlled. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she saw," "she realized") in the final third slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Elara's perceptual signature (bone-setting language, forgiving skepticism, the metaphor of "cleft in certainty") is consistent and voice-particular. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the tooth-placement beat and opening for the mother's remembered voice. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon—no register drift. Minor slip: "absurdly like constellations" hedges the image rather than committing, and "something she could not articulate" / "could not quite name" loops across two paragraphs without added texture.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and consistent perceptual signature—Elira's touch-driven navigation, light-focused attention. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("multitudes," "communion") that tensions the grounded sensory baseline but remains legible. The phrase "柔软的布料" (soft cloth in Chinese) is a clear error, likely a generation artifact. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively between lyric expansion and compressed action, though the closing paragraph's sustained abstract register ("purpose rekindled," "communion") flattens immediacy under the weight of thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled ("honeyed hush," "drip of thawing icicles"). POV is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, though some lines ("protected vulnerability—this is what I offer her now") read as slightly elevated for the moment. Perceptual signature is strong (moss, water, light). The phone-call dialogue is brief but purposeful. Compression is taught and pays off at closure. Minor diction drift in reflective beats does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual filtering. Voice has a lyric, reflective texture appropriate to a novelist's interiority, though elevated diction occasionally drifts ("solemnize," "feral nexus," "lucidity") in ways that edge toward writerly self-consciousness rather than embodied thought. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The recurring phrases ("against the current," "feral nexus," "inside the whisper of closing pages") create intentional motif but border on over-patterning. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Free indirect thought is clean, and the narrator's way of noticing—through literary metaphor and recursive memory—is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: brass goggles, clicking tools, reverent hands, patient work. Elara's lens filters the arbor through generational duty and tinkerer's care. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"desiccated," "genetic memory," "pollinators"—matching her scholarly focus. The nameless melody and the phrase "a way of speaking directly to the sleeping patterns encoded in the vine's DNA" fuse mysticism and science in a voice-consistent idiom. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at the climax ("her voice rising and falling") without filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and clean throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("patience of frost settling on stone," "cartography of a different kind," "moving stillness"). Diction remains consistent with Elara's contemplative, ritualistic stance; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices debris, light, and pattern with a bias toward alchemical metaphor. The voice modulates appropriately as the ritual intensifies toward the blue-flame sealing, and no elision withholds facts the POV knows.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and clean. Perceptual signature is distinct: "peripherally focused," noticing "resistance of springs" and "whisper of tumblers." Diction is controlled and elevated ("sediment forming stone," "reflective practitioner") without register drift. No dialogue appears. Distance remains consistent; the introspective register fits a solitary, meditative scene.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: she filters setting through craft (librarian between shelves, patterns as categories of sorrow). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("shingled hush," "whale-boned," "calcify"). No dialogue to judge. Compression ("threatening to calcify her from the inside, to turn her heart to stone") is purposeful and the doubled phrase intensifies rather than dilutes. Psychic distance modulates appropriately when remembering her arrival. One minor slip: "the weights of different burdens, those that melted down" uses "weights" and "burdens" in close echo without functional distinction, a small texture flaw that does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV interiority maintains consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (wood shavings as "whispers," rain's "crystallized" light). Diction is controlled and rhythmically varied in earlier paragraphs. The final paragraph, however, shows syntactic monotony—a drumbeat of "and" chains—and the narrator's voice converges into abstract philosophizing that feels less character-particular. Free indirect style is clean throughout, and the widow's way of noticing (arena sawdust scent, the husband's window-standing) is selective and memory-biased. Compression under emotional weight is acceptable, but the ending's elevated register drifts from the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; perceptual signature (scavenger's "methodical desperation," collection logic) is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction ("fractured stillness," "granular goal," "smoke pretending to be something finer") maintains elevated lyric consistency without register breaks. The speech to the ghost shifts into philosophical articulation—plausible for a character framing a negotiation, but it tilts toward written eloquence rather than pressure-compressed thought. Minor filter-verb density ("she understood," "she felt") in several beats slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and Mara's engineering idiom (calculations, aquifer angles, filtration systems) colors perception consistently. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close interiority ("Her mind began cycling through equations") and wider civic vision. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"maze of intentions," "psychological architecture," "stoic wonder as the only appropriate response"—that exceeds her on-page voice in peak beats, especially at closure. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. Perceptual signature is functional but not deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters the sanctuary through clockwork metaphors ("eternal circuit," "gears that had been waiting"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close at the winding moment. The prose occasionally elevates into abstract register ("the acceptance of impermanence that my grandfather had tried to capture") that slightly exceeds the narrator's established idiom under peak emotion. No dialogue to evaluate. Sentence rhythm and lexicon remain consistent, with strong specificity ("the small key in my pocket, the one I had been carrying for twenty years") anchoring reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and controlled throughout; the narrative voice is distinct, favoring elevated diction ("liminal auditory space," "serene upheaval") that suits a scholar-seeker. Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads landscapes, interprets wear patterns, and trusts training instincts. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested. Minor slips: "silence of morning radio" is a curious phrase (radio silence typically means no broadcast, not static-hush), and "training instincts" appears twice in identical phrasing, creating a template echo that slightly dulls the voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and often lyrical ("small ghosts," "oceanic hush," "memory of the storm"), which fits a philosophical collector but occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("truth could not be rushed"). Perceptual signature is present (he sees patterns others miss) but not deeply idiosyncratic. The voice is textured yet borders on formulaic in places: "patience as the man himself," "gentle as breathing and as necessary as seed-time and harvest." No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, elevated register: "the particular reverence of someone who had made a profession of farewells," "silence left behind." Perceptual signature is consistent—filtering through a narrator attuned to absences, light, and documentation. Free indirect style is clean. Diction remains controlled and literary throughout. Under peak reflection (the final paragraph), the voice modulates slightly but stays coherent. No dialogue is present. The prose carries a singular texture that fits the character's occupation and stance. Minor slip: the phrase "lonesome splendor" in the final sentence reads as a callback to the generation prompt rather than voice-motivated language, creating a hairline register bump.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the prince throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: "that particular bitterness," "that bittersweet ache," "that quaking reverie" establish a specific texture of nostalgic discovery. Diction stays within the prince's plausible lexicon with occasional elevated register ("hieroglyphs," "genesis," "symbiosis") that fits the scholarly quest tone. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the prince handles the egg. Minor repetition of "that particular" construction across the piece creates a slight template cadence but remains voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual filtering (sand "like powdered obsidian," coin "like an ember"). Diction is elevated and lyric, though register occasionally drifts toward abstracting lyricism ("the stubborn grace of someone who chose") that edges past the focalizer's lived idiom. Purposeful compression and poetic cadence are consistent, but the voice flattens slightly in the final paragraph's summary mode. No dialogue is present to judge. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, so experimental tolerance applies, but the textural signature weakens when thematic summary takes over.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through her skeptic's lens, the prose filtered by her luminous awareness and sidereal patience. Diction remains consistent—"realistically imaginative patience," "deflating dusk"—though occasional phrases ("temporal residue," "lived orientation") drift toward elevated register. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are inapplicable. Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice modulates subtly with pressure, though it maintains a meditative cadence even at the climactic unstick moment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and textured with Vael's otherworldly perceptual signature: sonar pings, translucent hands, organic rhythms felt against brass. Diction is consistently elevated and voice-specific ("approximation itself, the infinite regression of calculation chasing its own tail") without register drift. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound. The prose modulates appropriately—lyric in transit, tightening when the gear ticks. One blemish: "唤醒" (a Chinese character meaning "awaken") appears mid-sentence ("waiting for the right pattern of attention to唤醒 it"), reading as a generation artifact or untranslated fragment that disrupts voice coherence. Otherwise, psychic distance and free indirect style are clean, and the perceptual bias (sentimentalist lens on mechanical object) is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "weathered glass," "drumming stillness," "thundering calm." Psychic distance remains stable; Elara's interiority is richly textured without head-hopping. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "spectral mentorship" and "collective grief," which edge toward academic abstraction. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—shorter beats at the butterfly ascent, longer reflection earlier—but maintains coherence. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The voice reads singular and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable, with Marcus's perceptual signature clear in his professional focus on millimeters and mechanisms. Voice carries a distinct elevated lyricism ("the universe held its breath," "tiny inscriptions carved along the broken rake handle") that fits the searing-reverie tone but occasionally drifts into writerly register during peak reflection ("the grammar of his grief"). No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he had learned") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. Brief register drift in the phrase "incremental absolution was not about erasure but about carrying" reads slightly expository for the established interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable; third-person limited tracks the gardener's perceptions without head-hopping. Diction is controlled—"velveteen gloom," "tired watchers," "patient and waiting"—and rhythmically consistent. Brief register drift: "office and authority," "culmination of a long struggle," and "initiates" elevate beyond the gardener's established voice without clear motivation. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but not stress-tested; the gardener's noticing remains calm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns, timelines, predictive ripples. Diction is elevated and consistent, fitting a scholar-seer, though some phrases ("连锁反应" mid-text, "productive tension") feel imported rather than embodied. No head-hopping. Register remains controlled. The prose carries narrative confidence and rhythmic variation, and the opening/closing images frame the moment purposefully. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she reflected") are frequent but voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: Mira's attention to texture, sound, and the interplay of light and shadow feels consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" anchoring voice. No dialogue is present. However, some interiority leans on label-speak ("meticulous, scientific mind," "thistled calm") rather than embodied perception, and the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("She was a pirate broadcaster...") that flattens immediacy. Strong voice control overall, with minor slips in filter density and summary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; diction is elevated and consistent with Mira's meditative artistic practice. Perceptual signature is clear (art-historical reference, ritual metaphor), but occasional phrases—"the kind that only love can build and only truth can dismantle"—drift into aphoristic register that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance holds close throughout; no dialogue appears (appropriately for solitary ritual). Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats, though some longer constructions in the final paragraph feel slightly ornamental under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV first-person voice is controlled, scholarly, and distinct: formal register ("the particular kind of decay that follows when people flee"), careful syntax, and perceptual signature (noticing "charcoal marks where officials had recorded tide schedules"). Psychic distance remains stable. Diction matches the narrator's intellectual lens throughout. No dialogue present. The prose occasionally leans into abstraction ("the sedimentary layers of story…compress into a single flat stone") that edges toward over-articulation, but the voice remains consistent and purposeful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Eleanor with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: musician's ear, worn gesture, recognition of accent-as-wound. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("expectantly resigned despair," "traveled stillness") in ways that read more authorial than character-filtered under pressure. No dialogue is present beyond Eleanor's single question, which fits the contemplative mode. Compression and reflection are purposeful, and the final image holds Eleanor's lens cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elena filters the world through taste and touch. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-motivated ("cathedral of decay," "synaptic landscape"). However, in peak moments the prose defaults to abstraction ("flavors she had only ever tasted in dreams," "worlds exploded across her consciousness") rather than micro-sensory specificity. Psychic distance holds, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice is coherent and purposeful, though compression under pressure could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is generic ("her hand trembled," "breath catch") without character-particular idiom. Dialogue between Elara and Mira is functional but interchangeable in register; Mira's diction ("You preserve wonder in routine") is unnaturally articulate for a seven-year-old. The prose modulates adequately with scene pressure but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture or lexical specificity that would mark this voice as singular.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's attention to "minute departures" and "spaces between things" creates consistent textural filtering. Diction is elevated and lyric ("violet hour," "sanctify of careful attention") but voice-coherent throughout, maintaining a contemplative register appropriate to the accumulative mode. However, the prose occasionally slips into purple territory ("the hush of understanding that some truths have always been waiting") where compression would sharpen impact. The phrase "sanctify of careful attention" appears to be a typo or malapropism (sanctity?), creating a rare clarity slip in otherwise controlled language.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering the garden through Thalassor's stone consciousness. Perceptual signature is distinct: "his telepathy stretched outward like currents," "learned that the garden did not need a guardian—it needed a witness." Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. However, elevated diction in peak moments ("incisively kind," "善意 from malice," "consensu reality") occasionally drifts from the established voice, and the final paragraph's thesis-like phrasing ("Some secrets were not meant to be kept but shared") edges toward over-articulation rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third; distance and tense are consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: Maren notices through a mathematician's lens ("angles of incidence," "quantum-like potential"), and her "meticulous handwriting" and "balancedly daring nature" are woven into narration. The diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("perpetual motion," "quantum-like potential") that feels slightly at odds with embodied crisis, but the voice remains coherent and purposeful. No dialogue is present; no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: Mira notices textures, moonlight, symbols, and emotional resonance in specifics ("canvas shoes silent," "brush with bristles that caught the moonlight"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "saffron quiet," "methodically hopeful," "moon-tipped brush." No dialogue. Compression is purposeful and legible. Minor register drift in "the long loneliness of believing that kindness vanished like smoke" feels slightly elevated for the moment but does not break voice. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren filters the world through historically oriented, preservationist attention. Diction is elevated and textured ("displacement," "cultural extinction by decree") without violating plausibility for a cultured museum guide. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Some filter verbs ("She thought of," "she watched") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Iris notices geometric patterns, mechanical sequences, and temporal inversions. The prose carries a specific texture ("her counter-clockwise world collapsing into light") with controlled diction. However, peak-stress moments lean on elevated register ("bleak exhilaration," "cold resolve") that occasionally distances rather than embodying her state, and several filter verbs ("she felt," "she could see") dull immediacy when directness would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Clara with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a Gothic register appropriate to the material ("crooked tooth in an old man's grin," "luminance that seemed to emanate from her own skin") though some diction feels externally imposed rather than filtered through Clara's lived idiom ("photographically cursed," "repulsive allure"). The advisor's voice is dramatized but not distinct in syntax or lexicon from Clara's narration. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited is clean and stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, anchored in the prophet's perception. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("atmospheric script written in vapor and light," "great composition that surrounded all living things") that reads writerly rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (acoustic geography, resonance patterns) but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure since no pressure appears.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering the turtle city through Mira's cartographic lens—"hum-of-origin," "pattern-between," "frequency." Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with syntactic rhythm modulating purposefully from patient exposition ("moved through the amber light") to compressed urgency at the whistle moment. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows cleanly as pressure builds. One minor slip: "The Council said they had chosen to leave, that the scholars of the Spiral Compass had found their patterns…" reads slightly expository for a character who already disbelieves this, though it quickly pivots to contradictory evidence. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices spirals, resonance, ink dots—and the prose rhythm tightens without register drift under peak stress. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative distance is stable and the prose maintains a consistent scholarly register throughout. However, diction occasionally inflates beyond the dramatized moment ("emotional rationality," "cascaded through generations," "parallel lines of history converged") into academic abstraction. The single-POV reflection is clean with no head-hopping, but the voice skews toward essay mode rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices "absence the way others read scripture" and thinks in metaphors of archeology and correspondence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the inkwell discovery, pulling back slightly for the final reflection. Diction remains consistent and elevated without jarring register shifts, though "hushed blaze" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly imposed. Rhythm varies: short urgent sentences during the wade-in, longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue, so those bullets are not applicable. No head-hopping or unmotivated filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature (patient, logical, detail-oriented) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "construct alternatif hypothesis") that feels writerly rather than internally lived. No dialogue is present. Distance and tense are clean, and the prose reflects her methodical mind, though some constructions ("the quiet had a different quality—a density that suggested presence") edge toward ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable and intimate throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; perceptual signature is strong (Mira notices light, texture, craft mechanics, grief as luminescence). Diction is elevated but consistent with the lyric-meditative register ("luminous torment," "fold sorrow into shapes that could hold light"), and the syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer, layered sentences during reflection; shorter beats during the dream playback). Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression and poetic phrasing are pattern-taught early and legible. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose reads as character-specific: a grief-saturated craftsperson whose perceptions are filtered through making and loss. Voice is distinctive and rhythmically controlled under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test, but a minor register consistency check (occasional academic formality, e.g., "insidious: a constant luminescence") keeps this just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: philosophical, dense, image-driven, with purposeful compression ("things that were there and are not, things that were not there and are"). Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (mathematical metaphors, the geode as anchor) is consistent. The prose modulates under pressure—short bursts ("She was right. She was also dead now, and I was alive") against longer, looping meditations. Minor issue: some figurative language edges toward over-density ("the sky outside the observatory's windows burns with the particular purple of a sun that set years ago" introduces temporal confusion without payoff). No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third-person with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's sharp-eyed, discovery-oriented lens colors the narration throughout. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("knife-edge ridge," "brilliant dimness"), and the voice remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue is present, so voice distinction is not tested. The psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and the prose reflects Mira's searching, observant stance. Minor register drift into lyric abstraction ("frequency of belonging," "every pilgrim's trail") is voice-motivated and fits the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Maren's guilt-filtered attention—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tempered regret," "sieved hush") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the watch-hand moment. No dialogue on the page to assess. The prose carries a distinct melancholic rhythm, though some word choices ("quell," "sieved") read as prompt echoes rather than organic voice. Focalization remains clean and the internal texture is consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, meditative register—"a familiar word," "breath held too long," "patient earth." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from exterior action to interior reflection. The prose carries consistent texture (elevated, slightly formal) that fits the negotiator's contemplative stance. Dialogue is minimal but naturalistic. Filter verbs ("thought about," "understood") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than artifactual. No head-hopping or POV leakage mars the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance; perceptual signature filters setting through Elara's priorities (navigator's eye, memory of the osprey nest). Diction stays within her lexicon—"stubborn as tide pools in drought," "gravitated toward the shore"—and modulates appropriately under emotional pressure. No dialogue present; internal voice is distinct and consistent. The phrase "aligning heart and action" reads slightly elevated but remains plausible for a former research professional in a moment of breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable, third-person limited with strong free indirect style: "What remained was a baseball...its leather worn to the suppleness of something handled by a thousand nervous fingers." Perceptual signature is consistent—Vera notices texture, weight, and light patterns—and diction fits her post-procedure wonder without filter-verb stacks. The traveler's single line of dialogue ("You came") is natural and goal-driven. Two slips touch high-band eligibility: "delicate robust" reads as a forced oxymoron for the prompt attribute rather than voice-motivated phrasing, and the closing sentence's syntax ("both states existing simultaneously") tilts toward explanatory register. Otherwise, rhythmic control and psychic distance modulate cleanly with the underground descent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV, stable focalization, no head-hopping. The narrative voice is consistent and lyric, with purposeful compression and elevated diction. However, register peaks into abstract philosophizing ("cosmic intimacy," "proof that love...was larger than death") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Perceptual signature is present (scent-focus, beast whisperer lens) but not exploited for contradiction or sensory hierarchy under stress. Dialogue absent; all interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose establishes a distinct, lyrical register with purposeful compression ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "cloudbound glade") and the POV remains stable in close third. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract registers that strain the character's plausible lexicon under peak stress: "willingly perplexed," "calcified," "liminal," "sediment in still water." The final paragraph's philosophical phrasing ("not by accumulation but by acceptance, not by grasping what was lost but by releasing what never could be kept") reads more like authorial summation than the cartomancer's organic thought under the pressure of self-cutting. The voice is controlled and purposeful, but the register mismatch at closure slightly flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—"careful grace of someone who had learned to move without disturbing the dust motes." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the stitching sequence. Some diction reaches for elevated register ("ghostly resolve," "accumulated grief finally released into something productive") that risks slipping outside immediate perception. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood," "noticed") are frequent but mostly voice-motivated. The final sentence achieves rhythmic control: "all those preserved faces, all those ancient tears, all that shadow finally integrated into light."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose establishes a consistent lyric-meditative register and maintains stable third-person limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is present in the filtering of sensory detail through Mara's reflective stance. However, elevated diction ("vibrant hush," "prowling with quiet grace") clusters densely in peak beats without variation under pressure, and the final paragraph's summary mode flattens voice. The single Chinese character "火山" is unexplained and disrupts idiom consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, with narrative distance appropriate to Elara's composed vigilance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("纪念碑 to knowledge," "winking hush") that clashes with the pragmatic sentinel viewpoint. Elara's perceptual signature—her "methodical nature" cataloging anomalies—provides some specificity, but her interior voice in the discovery sequence reads as procedural exposition rather than a distinct rhythm under stress. No dialogue appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Mira's perceptual signature (mathematical progressions, precognitive fragments, inherited knowledge) filters all description. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("ribbons of liquid mercury," "embers," "wing") that modulates pressure without obscuring clarity. Minor slips: "sacred" and "borrowed dawn" recur as unearned conceptual shorthand in peak beats, and the phrase "something the eels carried in their elusive bodies" at closure hedges specificity when concreteness would sharpen impact. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature ("peculiar stillness," "thinner than sound, something purer than meaning"). Vocabulary is controlled and voice-consistent through metaphor (cartography of scars, motion versus movement). However, register occasionally drifts high under peak pressure: "rarefy," "liminal space," "rarefied and pure" feel elevated beyond natural thought during crisis. The phrase "furiously tranquil in her conviction" directly articulates the paradox rather than letting action embody it. Psychic distance is well-managed and the prose reflects Mira's artistic sensibility, but some word choices prioritize lyricism over urgency in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice is stable but elevated to academic register throughout ("diplomatic intellectual," "philosophical discourse made manifest") without modulation under pressure. The danish tin card is withheld knowledge: "he had not yet needed to deploy its sharp edges" teases without payoff, violating POV modesty. Dialogue is absent. The younger scholar's interiority is asserted ("his certainty absolute") without access, creating a single-POV leak. Register drift: "veneer of scholarly politeness" and "rehabilitation teaching him that limitation could become advantage" read as narrator gloss rather than Varn's lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "the silence of two strangers who had not yet decided if they could trust each other with words" reflects Mira's vagrant caution. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("books remembered their readers" as an oblique trust probe). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels less vagrant-specific: "architects of something small but whole," "indifferent stars," "a thing of beauty forged from the anarchy of circumstance." These phrases are lyrical but slightly above the established voice's grit. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (zooming out for the warden's arrival), and the final paragraph's lyricism charges the closure without breaking frame.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices atmospheric and musical details (the "bruised violet and tarnished silver" horizon, "the particular silence that settles after expectation exhausts itself"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though at peak moments it drifts toward poetic generality ("condensation and memory," "longing, impossible in every way that mattered") rather than character-specific idiom. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The narrative voice modulates appropriately between melancholic reflection and physical action, maintaining coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register. Diction ("seventeen shades of possibility," "luminous doubt," "crystalline doubt") is purposeful and creates textural cohesion. Psychic distance remains close, and perceptual signature (cataloging, measuring, naming) is character-specific. However, the climactic vision floods in as summary—"she saw…she felt…she understood"—rather than unfolding through embodied perception or micro-choices that reveal the mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds steadily; Marek's perceptual signature is slow, attentive to small shifts (light, wind, threads), consistent with his tutor persona. Diction is controlled and lyric without slipping into register mismatch. Two minor slips: "the tide of remembrance was turning" feels slightly abstract-poetic rather than character-filtered, and "cerulean regret, he thought" risks naming the theme too explicitly mid-reflection. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from stillness to the final gesture, and the rhythm supports the contemplative mode without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and particular, fusing scientific diction with sensory, grounded observation in a way that feels true to a neutron star researcher. Her way of noticing—light curves, matter thresholds, accumulated changes—acts as a perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism. The narrative distance stays stable, and reflective passages are anchored in concrete stimuli (butterfly, dust, greenhouse debris). At times, the register edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains mostly within a coherent, character-driven voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture anchored in Mira’s sensibility as a glass artist and desert dweller; what she notices and how she describes it feel character-specific. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with smooth modulation between concrete observation and reflection. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly know. The voice supports the drifting, resonant tone without blurring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, with diction tuned to a precise, quasi-scientific but still lyrical sensibility (“cartography of unshaken marvels,” “reading the temperature of the air itself as a language of feeling”). The perceptual filter feels plausibly Elara’s—attuned to heat, architecture, and music rather than generic description. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose fluid without drawing undue attention to themselves. There’s minimal exposition-for-the-reader; most information passes through her focused noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, measured, and gently lyrical, matching Aldric’s temperament and the funereal subject matter. Diction and rhythm are controlled without calling attention to themselves, and interior access is stable with no head-hopping. The narration leans somewhat toward an omniscient-literary register rather than a strongly idiosyncratic Aldric filter, which slightly blurs the “perceptual signature” at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mira’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control in lines like “her approach was gently persistent, the way water eventually carves stone.” Diction and syntax are consistent and appropriate to a reflective, community-centered protagonist; the “amplified quiet” at night is both sonic and political, giving the voice a distinct perceptual signature. Free-indirect access to her thoughts (“she felt the particular grief of proximity”) is smooth and unintrusive. Occasional abstract formulations and thesis-like sentences slightly dilute the otherwise strong texture.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-calibrated to Mei’s contemplative, sensory-rich perception.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is assured, lyrical, and intellectually inflected in a way that feels true to a hedge-maze designer steeped in theory. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but not sterile, with phrases like “atoms too polite to mention their imminent departure” establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between sensory detail and high-concept reflection without losing track of the present scene. The uniform register means we don’t see how the voice behaves under radically different emotional pressures, but within this mode it’s strongly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits Mira’s patience and gravity. Diction choices—theological (“catechism,” “confessional”), sensual (“green scent of dormant potential”), and mechanical (“biometric scanner,” “mechanical click”)—create a distinct texture without feeling patchworked. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narration’s certainty remains plausibly within what Mira can infer and know. At times the voice leans slightly toward authorial abstraction, but overall the perceptual signature (what she notices and why) is strong and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and closely aligned with Elara’s perceptual quirks, especially her sound-color synesthesia, which gives the prose a distinctive texture. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching the reflective mode but staying legible. The narrative confidence—asserting what sound “is” and how trust breaks—feels character-grounded rather than authorially didactic. There’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; everything passes plausibly through Elara’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mira’s sensibility, with controlled syntax and evocative diction that feel intentional rather than generic.

The main restraint is that the register stays uniformly elevated, offering little modulation or roughness that might deepen character particularity under pressure.

    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in the glassblower’s sensibilities and craft. Phrasing like “temperamental temperament” and some stacked modifiers flirt with excess but remain legible and voice-coherent. His theatrical spoken line about “the hungry flames” feels in-character and distinguishes his outward playfulness from his inward gravity. Overall, POV control and rhythmic modulation are strong, if not quite at the level of effortless precision required for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and largely character-coherent, with sensory-rich diction and a consistent interior lens. Sentences vary in rhythm and show good control over pacing, especially in moving between reflection and in-the-moment fear. Daniel’s brief dialogue aligns with his manipulative status without breaking register. There is some mild drift into abstract, essayistic phrasing at peak beats, but not enough to break the illusion of a pressured, thinking body on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled rhythm and a consistent elevated diction that matches the mythic register. The prose maintains a steady psychic distance, blending exterior description with interior perception without head-hopping or stance confusion. Recurrent phrases (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) feel intentional rather than tic-like and help pattern the piece. At times, abstractions (“the weight of every silence she had ever kept”) edge toward generality, but clarity and tonal coherence hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and coherent, blending clinical precision with lyric abstraction in a way that suits a newly self-reflective robot. Diction is consistent, with phrases like “processing threads” and “maintenance routines” coexisting smoothly with more mystical language about “looped timelines” and “mundane mysticism.” At times, the analytic register edges toward authorial essay rather than pure character-filtered perception, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is consistent, measured, and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature built around mediation, refraction, and ambiguity. Diction is elevated but fits the character’s reflective temperament and the fable-like world. Psychic distance is controlled; we stay close enough to his thoughts to feel his shifts without head-hopping or stance confusion.

The modulation across beats is subtle rather than dramatic, but the perceptual signature is strong enough for high-band competence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct: a technically minded worker who experiences machinery almost somatically, yet retains a restrained lyricism (“pages of a book being read in slow motion”). ARIA’s clipped, cold diction contrasts nicely with Kira’s warmer, tactile perspective, and there’s no head-hopping or distance confusion. The narrative lexicon (magnetic nexus, alignment matrix, temporal vectors) fits the POV’s competence and the world’s tone. At times the register tilts slightly toward expository explanation, but it remains within a plausible narrative voice for a seasoned mechanic-turned-researcher.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to a musician preoccupied with thresholds, with consistent diction and distance. The prose’s sensibility—“liminal hollow,” “vocabulary of vibration and resonance”—feels plausibly like Elena’s frame rather than generic omniscience. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative rhythm modulates effectively between description, interiority, and action. Occasionally the voice edges into abstract formulation, yet it retains clarity and a coherent perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)

Psychic distance tightens appropriately at emotional peaks without head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative balances abstraction and concrete sensory detail, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature (fixation on data margins, storm behavior, and subtle physical traces like the thumb-smudge). A few lines edge toward essayistic reflection but they fit her exhausted, analytical temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to a reflective, skeptical urban explorer—technical where needed but also capable of lyric turns. The diction (“liminal quality,” “accumulative/textural ghost shift,” etc.) generally stays plausible for Marcus’s education and interests as a documentary-minded forum denizen. Rhythm modulates well between longer, atmospheric sentences and tighter lines at moments of strangeness, and there’s no POV slippage or unmotivated omniscience. A few moments verge on essayistic abstraction, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature that favors organic, cyclical metaphors and slow, meditative syntax. Phrases like “air… burrow through the paper’s memories” and “silence waited like an old friend” feel coherent to this consciousness and world. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction suits the mythic, timeless register. Occasionally, the prose edges toward uniform lushness, but it stays legible and purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with deft control of rhythm and diction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinct, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in surveillance, patterns, and currents. Diction and rhythm feel intentionally patterned to echo fortunes and classified reports without becoming stiff. Psychic distance stays stable; we never head-hop or slip into omniscience beyond what a reflective close third can justify. The only constraint on going higher is that the modulation under “peak” pressure (the letter beat) is relatively subdued, so we don’t see the voice tested at full strain.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, learned, and slightly mystical, with a controlled elevated diction that fits a rhetorically trained priest contemplating metaphysics. Sentences are rhythmically varied, often doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theology plus character), and the narrative distance holds steady. The way the narrator describes tools and concepts (“decorated the sanctuary with silence,” “the investigation of thresholds”) feels like a consistent perceptual signature rather than generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent in a close third-person that clearly belongs to this character’s sensibility. Diction like “chronologically homesick” and “mathematics of time folded into something organic and ancient” feels both poetic and character-appropriate for an oracle steeped in time.

There is no head-hopping or register whiplash to disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)

POV distance remains stable; we never leak into an external, explanatory stance that contradicts Mira’s perspective. A touch more idiosyncratic, character-colored noticing (beyond cosmological abstractions) could push the voice into even more singular territory.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Maren’s musical background and sensory loss, with consistent diction and controlled psychic distance.

Aside from a small typographical glitch (“隔离”), the narrative voice is polished and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with an observant, measured lexicon that fits a seasoned scientist and meticulous recorder. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence structures and a calm, precise tonality even under threat, which suits Elena’s temperament. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and reflective passages maintain the same perceptual signature. The main ceiling is that the voice, while strong and appropriate, doesn’t yet feel idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakably singular at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)

The voice is strong enough for elite markets, though it doesn’t quite reach the unmistakable singularity of the very best pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Marina’s sensibility as an acoustically attuned artist; what she notices (sound, resonance, echo) reliably filters description. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to sustain a musical feel without becoming mannered, and psychic distance is stable. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence matches what Marina can plausibly infer. The voice stops short of the most distinctive echelon only because its lyric register, while strong, is more “excellent craft” than unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Vera’s analytic yet sensuous mind; diction like “professionally thorough,” “emotional medicine coated in sugar,” and “frequency of every person who had ever sat alone in a room” feels unified and purposeful. POV distance is steady, with no leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative stance (slightly wry, reflective, precise) matches the character’s expertise and detachment.

There is no head-hopping; Corwin and the community appear only through her perception, preserving focalization. The voice occasionally edges toward generalized abstraction in the thematic lines, but overall it maintains a distinct, character-shaped narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to a meticulous illustrator protagonist; diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than generic. Sensory focus (sounds, subtle movements of water, textures of metal and paper) reflects Sera’s priorities and gives the narration a distinct perceptual signature. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and the lyricism remains legible. A touch more modulation—sharper, tenser rhythms at the borrowing moment—could deepen impact, but the current execution is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly in character for a scientifically minded, reflective nursery owner; diction like “transplant shock” and “seasonal stressors” feels organic. Sentences modulate rhythmically between long, textured observation and shorter, decisive gestures (“Now, with evening approaching… Vera did something she hadn't done in years—she stopped.”).

POV modesty is maintained; we never depart her knowledge frame, and reflective passages are anchored in concrete stimuli.

Overall, the voice is distinctive and confident enough for upper-tier venues, if not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s obsessions with light, circuitry, and time. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a stable, meditative cadence that suits the reflective mode. There is no POV slippage or unwarranted omniscience; the narrative certainty matches what Elara could plausibly infer. The main limitation is monotony of register—intensity modulates only slightly, so the prose rarely sharpens or fractures under implied emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with the nameless one’s sensibility, with recurring diction around rhythm, rust, layers, and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: a meticulous, almost reverent attention to process and subtle light. Technical terms (Tycho, regolith, service module, chemical developing chamber) are integrated smoothly into the lyric register. At times the diction edges into slightly generalized abstraction (“beauty could exist even in the coldest and loneliest places”) that feels more authorial than deeply idiosyncratic to Mira, but this doesn’t break POV or rhythm. Overall, the voice balances clarity and lyricism in a way that suits the accumulative, contemplative design.

Diction and syntax are controlled, with a musical quality that suits a bell tuner’s perspective without drifting into self-parody. Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate, allowing occasional abstract reflections while remaining anchored in present action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is a confident, lyrical close third that stays inside Marina’s perceptual frame while allowing elevated diction appropriate to the quasi-mythic tone. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well with pressure, especially around the opening of the vial and the flooding visions.

At times, the voice risks uniform lushness, but it maintains a distinct perceptual signature and emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly tuned to Maren’s sensibility—its metaphors and diction feel like the thoughts of someone who lives through fabric, tides, and ruin-beauty. The narrative distance is consistent, slipping smoothly between close perception and more mythic exposition without confusion.

A slight tendency toward uniformly elevated diction in all beats flattens modulation but doesn’t break the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, supple, and character-specific, blending archaeological precision with a quiet lyricism that matches Mira’s temperament.

Diction choices like “space where an apology waits unspoken” and “fierce tenderness” feel coherent with Maren’s sensibility and the story’s metaphysics rather than imposed from outside. Psychic distance is well managed, slipping between sensory description and interior reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elira’s educated, reflective sensibility. Diction and rhythm are carefully tuned ('vernacular of shrapnel and healing bone') without slipping into an implausible register for her background.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and slightly lyrical, well-suited to an observant restorer in an uncanny acoustic space. Diction and syntax feel plausibly within Elena’s educated, craft-oriented register, and the narration’s confidence doesn’t outstrip her knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric but controlled, with phrases like “think in whispers” and “water table of rebellion” giving the piece a distinct perceptual signature. POV discipline is solid: we remain inside Maren’s interpretive frame even when worldbuilding is dense, and the one line of dialogue is in-character and subtextual. Rhythms modulate effectively between lush description and tighter beats around the drone’s appearance. One coined term (“candidcryptic”) slightly calls attention to itself, but overall the voice feels unified and deliberate rather than overwritten.

There are a few explanatory sentences that lean toward essayistic (“She understood that moving on required forgetting”), yet they mostly feel like part of the piece’s reflective register rather than scaffolding. The rhythm varies well and supports the meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Elara-filtered, with academic-musical metaphors that fit her vocation and obsession. Prose modulates well with emotional intensity, lengthening and thickening during reflection and sharpening slightly as she writes and when Elian speaks. Dialogue, though brief, feels natural and carries subtext, especially Elian’s single line of wonder and recognition. The density of figurative language flirts with over-richness in places but remains controlled enough not to blur POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)

Interior access and narrative distance are well controlled; we never slip out of her lived experience even when the language becomes more abstract. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself has a distinct texture and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature—Eleanor notices light, motion, and systems (pigeons, dust, crystal structures) in a way that fits her history. Diction is elevated but coherent with the reflective, grief-soaked stance, and the syntax modulates well between long, sinuous sentences and tighter ones at key beats (“The voice bloomed and withered in the same breath…”). There’s no dialogue, but the narrative voice alone carries texture and emotional nuance. A hair more rhythmic variation under the climactic playback might have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and character-inflected, with metaphors and observations that feel like Elara’s mind at work rather than generic lyricism. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, modulating between longer reflective sentences and more decisive phrasing at the decision point (“She stood, featherly determined…”). There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and narrative certainty stays within what she can infer about her mother’s intent. It’s strong, though not quite distinctive enough in idiom or risk-taking to push into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses Marek’s sensibility and the narrative diction. Syntax, rhythm, and elevated vocabulary suit the contemplative, speculative tone without obvious register breaks. Imagery like “a fever dream dreamed in reverse” and “mathematicians of wonder” feels purposeful and thematically aligned rather than ornamental. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; distance remains steady and well-judged for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with consistent access through Maren’s perceptions and professional lexicon. Sentences have varied rhythm and a distinct texture that suits the quasi-mystical craft without sliding into academic or mismatched register. The fisher’s brief dialogue is simple and appropriate, contrasting with the more ornate narration in a way that underscores class and emotional position. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and confident, with a perceptual signature that aligns with Marek’s analytical, pattern-focused mind. The diction is elevated but consistent, and the narrative stance—slightly essayistic, observant—feels intentional rather than generic. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the rhythm modulates well between description and conceptual reflection. The main limit is that the voice prioritizes idea over felt urgency, which keeps it from being fully electrifying.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled and distinctive, with clear preference for fluid, tidal metaphors and long, sinuous sentences that match the subject. POV distance is stable and plausibly tied to the tide dancer’s perception; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythmic variation is adequate, with occasional shorter sentences providing relief from lushness. At times, elevated diction and density of imagery risk veering into uniform purple, but the pattern is consistent enough to feel intentional rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly tuned to this particular consciousness—speaking of glass “the way poets speak of love” feels organic to her worldview. Diction and syntax are elevated but not implausible for the narrative distance, and the rhythm modulates well between long, meditative sentences and tighter beats (e.g., when the stone hits the pond, when the boat engine starts). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is distinctive, though not quite so idiosyncratic or surprising as the very top band would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly Mira’s, with a firefighter’s technical awareness braided into poetic perception. Rhythm modulates well—longer, image-laden sentences for reflection, tighter ones around key statements—without falling into monotony. The single line of dialogue sits naturally in the voice and serves both character and theme. There are no POV leaks or stance confusions, and the lyricism feels controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, coherent, and suitably elevated for the quasi-philosophical material, with a distinctive fusion of scientific and poetic diction. POV distance is consistent; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the register veers into uniform, essay-like abstraction, flattening emotional immediacy and making paragraphs feel similar in rhythm. The voice is competent and recognizable but not yet dynamically modulated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with lyrical yet controlled diction that fits Mira’s observational, archival mindset. Sentences modulate rhythm well between broad scene-setting and the close work of examining diaries. Apart from a minor register/glitch (“他的记录的”), which jars slightly, the narrative stance feels confident and unified. The perceptual signature (walls dreaming, corridors breathing, ivy as audience) is distinct and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to a centuries-old, calm protagonist. Syntax and diction show control, with varied sentence rhythms and a gently elevated register that matches the magical-realist premise. The focalization stays stable in Aria, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. While the voice is strong, the emotional modulation is fairly even; there’s little shift in rhythm or texture to mark the story’s most charged beats.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice on Maren is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that matches her role and the ceremonial gravity of the moment. Sentence rhythm modulates well between expansive description and tighter, more direct lines around key realizations and dialogue. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying purpose and subtext rather than exposition. A couple of abstract phrasings brush against omniscient commentary, yet they mesh with the established elevated narrative stance rather than breaking POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctively cool-lyric: clinical diction braided with flashes of sentiment. POV boundaries are respected; the narration doesn’t claim knowledge beyond her experience and worldview. Rhythm modulates well between reflective exposition and present-moment description, keeping the texture from going flat. A few familiar phrases (“steel in her spine”) slightly dilute the otherwise particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct elevated register that fits the mythic, ceremonial quality of the scene. The POV is stable, with perceptions and diction plausibly tied to a highly sensitive, reflective protagonist in a stylized world. Some lines verge on purple, but overall rhythm and sentence modulation show deliberate craft rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and convincingly filtered through a reflective, educated artist; diction and syntax match his sensibility. Lyric tendencies (“meteor hush,” “fallen celestial eye”) feel integrated with his mind rather than imposed from outside. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the modulation from observational to more abstract philosophical registers remains smooth. While at times it leans toward essayistic, that drift is compatible with this narrator’s interior mode rather than a technical slip.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is cohesive, lyrical, and clearly tinted by Elara’s “esoteric realist” mind—scientific diction (“migration trajectories,” “tectonic plates”) sits naturally beside mythic and sensory language. Rhythm is well-controlled with varied sentence lengths that expand in contemplative moments and tighten subtly during the gust and rescue. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated register feels earned by the character’s age, vocation, and contemplative solitude. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without tipping into mannered opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in an artisan attuned to material and structure. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, especially in the long, flowing sentences that mirror her patient reweaving. Diction is elevated but mostly feels congruent with the contemplative, quasi-mythic frame. A few abstract formulations (“After forgiving yourself, the world looks different”) momentarily widen psychic distance, but they don’t disrupt overall coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, with a consistent elevated, slightly mystical register that fits the premise (“emotional cartography,” “threshold between walking and being walked”). POV is stable third-person close, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction edges toward abstraction and ornateness, but the pattern is taught early enough that it reads as intentional rather than accidental purple prose. Modulation under peak pressure is modest—intensity increases, but rhythm and distance don’t shift dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, mildly elevated, and fitting for an aging astronomer in a quasi-ancient palace; diction choices like “pattern-consciousness” and “frugal with meaning” feel thematically apt. The narrative distance is consistent, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond what a reflective close-third can plausibly infer. A few moments lean into abstract phrasing (“duskyaccord,” “beyond knowing”) that could be made more texturally concrete, but they don’t break legibility. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable, though not yet singular at a premier-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and mostly consistent, with strong openings like “In the soundless sanctuary, where light bent at impossible angles…”. POV stays stably centered on Mira with only mild omniscient coloration around Kael’s state, and psychic distance is well modulated. Dialogue generally carries subtext (love/resentment/grace) and goal pursuit, although a few lines land as too polished or thematic to feel fully spoken. A minor register tension exists between poetic imagery and clinical terms like “cellular memory,” but it mostly serves the speculative premise.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the fabulist tone, with controlled syntax and recurring diction around thresholds and membranes. POV is stable around Mira, with only mild omniscient lean-in that feels consistent with the mythic register rather than like head-hopping. The narrative cadence modulates appropriately between description and action, and there is no dialogue to complicate distance control. While the voice is strong and particular, it stops just short of the kind of overwhelming distinctiveness that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by Mira’s craft and guilt (“deciduous vows made manifest,” “accidental wisdom”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well with the emotional arc, growing more compressed and charged near the repair and reunion. Diction is slightly elevated but coherent with the reflective, quasi-mythic tone of the piece. There’s minimal exposition and no POV leakage, and the narrative distance is held confidently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture that fits both the speculative premise and Mira’s reflective mindset. Diction is elevated but coherent for the setting and character, and psychic distance stays stable without head-hopping. Lyric flourishes (e.g., “time moved like honey through a sieve”) generally enhance tone rather than obscure events. There are a few moments of generalized, essay-like phrasing, but they don’t significantly weaken the POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent with an erudite, mystical scholar navigating an impossible library. Diction and syntax are controlled, with patterned phrases like “unheard symphony” and “labyrinthine” contributing to a unified narrative texture. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the voice modulates appropriately from description to reflective insight. While it leans toward the abstract, it remains legible and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature—metaphors like “two rivers sharing a single current beneath ice” and “childhood in double exposure” feel both apt and character-specific. Third-person limited on Mira is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Elevated diction matches the slightly uncanny, mythic tone of the piece rather than reading as generic “fancy prose.” Under emotional pressure the voice maintains coherence, modulating intensity without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, refined, and plausibly aligned with a scholarly archivist, with controlled syntax and a measured, observant rhythm. Diction choices like “cathedral of iron and wood” and “warmly methodical patience” build a distinct perceptual signature without breaking plausibility. There is no POV leakage or unearned omniscience, and the modulation from quiet curiosity to awe is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and tightly linked to Mira’s sensory priorities (resonance, stress patterns, vibration), giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and syntax are elevated but appropriate for a disciplined specialist in a quasi-sacred environment, and they modulate nicely from descriptive density to calmer cadence at the hush. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the narrator never knows more than Mira plausibly could. The voice is strong enough for a high-end market without veering into mannered opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a clear lyrical texture that matches Elara’s contemplative, almost devotional mindset. Diction and syntax are controlled and intentional, with recurring cadences that feel stylistic rather than mechanical. The narrative stance mostly respects what Elara can plausibly infer while allowing occasional, gentle omniscient widenings that suit the mythic tone. There is no dialogue to test range, but the interior voice itself is coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and well-matched to a contemplative archivist in a fantastical observatory; diction and rhythm feel purposeful rather than generic. The piece teaches its lyrical, reflective mode early and sustains it without slips in POV or register. Sentences modulate length and cadence effectively enough to avoid monotony while maintaining a unified tone. The main limitation is that the very high register sometimes flattens emotional immediacy, keeping it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and colored by Mira’s occupational and familial lens, with nice touches like “controlled combustion” and counting chants as thought-rhythm. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic framing and never breaks POV plausibility. Rhythm modulates well between longer, reflective sentences and more clipped, focused preparation beats. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she notices materials, patterns, and light, which helps the voice feel individual rather than generic-lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with a contemplative, image-rich lexicon appropriate to a meticulous observer. POV control is tight; we never slip outside Mira’s consciousness, and the reflective mode remains anchored in present stimuli. Dialogue, though sparse, feels natural and carries subtext (“You still collect things” as both observation and emotional reach). Rhythmic variety and sentence music support the mood without tipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s sensibility, with distinctive phrases like “collect the flavors of different silences” and “gilded hush” functioning as a true perceptual signature. POV distance is steady and appropriate; we never slip into omniscience or unexplained knowledge outside her experience. Rhythms modulate well between longer, image-rich sentences and firmer declaratives at key beats. A few repeated constructions (“intangibly tangible,” parallel paradoxes) come close to mannerism but don’t significantly undercut the voice’s authority.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly colored by Maren’s professional and familial lens. Diction (“fluidly logical,” “architecture of silence,” “cathedral ceiling”) is consistent and distinctive without slipping out of control. The narrative stance occasionally widens to a gentle omniscience (“he would not remember…”) but does so cleanly and in keeping with the story’s contemplative mode. Overall, the perceptual signature is memorable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, coherent, and suited to a contemplative, mythic-futurist tale, with controlled lyricism (“each layer fell away like the pages of a book read backward through time”). Diction is mostly consistent with an educated, reflective protagonist and an elevated narrative stance. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. The voice is polished but somewhat familiar for the genre, lacking the sharply idiosyncratic edge that would make it unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct lexicon around ash, scars, thresholds, and breath. Sentences vary in length and structure to support a meditative yet forward-moving rhythm. The narrative distance stays stable; we never slip into information the focalizer couldn’t carry or an intrusive authorial stance. At times the abstract register comes close to generic “literary” cadence, but the specific imagery mostly rescues it from feeling interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture—lyric but not opaque—and a clear perceptual signature rooted in Maya’s skepticism and wary curiosity. Phrasing like “something that existed in the spaces between seconds” and “virtuously mischievous by nature” feels character-specific rather than generic. Psychic distance is well controlled, leaning closer as the quantum event unfolds and receding for brief, effective reflection. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the brief dialogue from the other Maya matches the piece’s tone while feeling slightly askew in a purposeful, glitchy way.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong sensibility for cadence and image (“wisteria had claimed what was once a manicured terrace, weaving chaos through the bones of order”). The diction and syntax feel unified with Elara’s reflective, educated perspective and the gothic-intellectual milieu of the Morrows. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays within a controlled, slightly elevated register. The only limitation is that the voice’s lushness occasionally edges toward uniformity of tone, without sharper modulation as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to a quasi-mythic fantasy vignette, with a confident control of cadence and elevated diction. The prose’s texture—“factually mystical quality,” “shivering bliss,” “perpetual darkness”—is consistent with Aldric’s reflective, almost penitent gaze. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register brushes against mild abstraction, but it never fully detaches from scene reality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Mara “reads” objects and spaces. Syntax and diction support a contemplative, historically-aware intelligence without sliding into academic abstraction. Occasional awkward phrasing (“examining unknown the evidence”) briefly jars, but overall distance control and narrative stance remain strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and well matched to Mira’s archival, pattern-reading mind—phrases like “read the palimpsest” and “scattered codes waiting to be deciphered” feel character-specific, not generic. There’s a confident, slightly lyrical narrative stance that doesn’t overreach into purple. With no dialogue, we don’t get stress-modulated speech, but interior access and diction remain consistent and plausible throughout. It’s distinctive and polished, if not yet singular enough in rhythm to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, contemplative cadence that suits the ritual and the ancient-techno-mystical premise. Diction like “vested hush,” “negative space,” and “quietly vivid ribbons of color” feels deliberate and characteristic rather than generic, giving the piece a recognizable texture. Psychic distance stays stable; we never slip into knowledge he couldn’t plausibly have except as inherited lore. The lyricism borders on uniform in tempo, and a touch more rhythmic variation under peak pressure could sharpen contrast, but it’s already at a high publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Seraphina’s sensibility (e.g., “patience of stone and the precision of flowing water,” “mossy delight”). Diction and rhythm are mostly well controlled and consistent with the mythic-folkloric register the story aims for. There are a few awkward or flawed constructions (“she always emerged transformed always,” “she prod the leaf”) that briefly break the spell and suggest line-level inattention. Overall, though, the narrative stance is confident and coherent, with no POV leakage or unjustified shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, fluent, and controlled, with a slightly elevated but believable register for a reflective, meticulous protagonist. Syntax varies nicely, and the narration integrates exposition and scene without clumsy info-dumps.

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with alchemical and craft-inflected diction (“balanced alchemist’s scales,” “veins deep in the earth where elemental forces still bled into the world”) that feels character-appropriate. Rhythm varies well between long, reflective sentences and more concise, action-oriented lines during the forge work, and psychic distance remains stable. Phrases like “factually mystical” are slightly awkward but read more as prompt-anchored than as true register drift. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct without becoming mannered or opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confidently close to Mira’s consciousness, with consistent diction and no head-hopping. Phrases like “places where the living and the dead shared the same thin air” and “music made of tears” establish a strong, distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Mira’s altered body and cognition, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Diction like “proprioceptively enhanced sense of body now a curse” and “mathematics of mercy” feels native to this character’s scientific/experimental background and trauma-obsessed mindset. Rhythm varies well between dense, winding sentences and more declarative beats in moments of realization. The elevated register is sustained and justified, with no significant leaks or distance confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm that suits a character who translates “silences” and liminal states. Diction choices like “visual史料,” “between-worlds translator,” and “reader of the in-between” create a clear perceptual signature without feeling like generic fantasy-narrator. Psychic distance remains stable and apt; we stay tightly in her perceptions even as she reflects across years. The only minor limitation is a tendency toward uniformly elevated lyricism, which slightly flattens modulation between discovery beats and quieter ones.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person point of view is consistent and well-controlled, with no leakage into other consciousnesses. Marcus’s perceptual signature—reading dust, cables, and emotional residues as “stories”—gives the voice character-specific texture. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with a thoughtful, precise observer, and the rhythm modulates well between description and interior reflections. A slight tendency toward uniform lyricism undercuts the sense of increased pressure, preventing this from feeling fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a patient, centuries-old operator in a baroque fantastical library. Diction (“after-reality,” “night-sweat of reality,” “compressed histories”) feels specific to this world and consciousness rather than generically ornate. The narrative stance remains stable and confident, with no POV leakage or awkward register shifts, and the rhythm modulates nicely between description and action.

Rhythm and diction are controlled, with recurring metaphors (amber honey, polished stone) reinforcing mood without obvious repetition artifacts. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the explanatory passages about mechanics still feel voice-colored rather than expository. Occasionally the narrative leans toward essayistic commentary, but it stays within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, confident, and lyrically textured, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Cassian’s craft and long solitude. Syntax, rhythm, and diction fit the quasi-mythic, tinkering-fantasy register and modulate nicely from descriptive patience to charged stillness near the climax. There are occasional abstract explanatory sentences, but they don’t break the voice or distance control. The absence of dialogue keeps the piece inward and meditative, which suits this mode and is handled with control.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctively textured, with a measured, lyrical cadence that matches Elara’s sensibility and the story’s contemplative mode. Diction like “architecture of stone” and “the interior of some vast and patient thinking” feels character-appropriate given her occupation and temperament, not like intrusive authorial lecture. Psychic distance is steady, with enough interior access to feel her perceptions without head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative avoids over-explaining motives, trusting images and carefully chosen abstractions to do much of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in tactile detail and oceanic metaphor that fits an artist used to "reading the ocean's vocabulary." Rhythm and sentence length modulate well between storm pressure and reflective revelation, and there’s no POV leakage.

Overall the voice feels confident, controlled, and specific enough for serious literary consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by an artist’s sensibility, with strong control over rhythm and a fondness for long, flowing sentences. Diction is elevated but consistent, and the prose’s attention to light, pattern, and color functions as a perceptual signature rather than generic “pretty writing.” There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains appropriate to a reflective, meditative piece. While the lyricism rarely tightens into sharper, harsher textures, the modulation between warm description and charged revelation works well for the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and tightly aligned with Miriam’s reflective, archival temperament. Syntax and diction (“mechanical lullaby,” “reverie tightening”) are controlled and varied, creating a distinct perceptual texture. Expository compression in the final paragraph (“She spoke of…”) is efficient but slightly flattens immediacy in the climactic exchange. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and stable, with no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear alignment to Elias’s contemplative, unsentimental stance.

While not radically idiosyncratic, the voice is strong, coherent, and publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses archival precision with poetic reverie (“concrete and determination,” “velvet disquiet”). Diction and syntax match Seraphine’s intellectual, ritualized world without drifting into jargon or breaking psychic distance. The brief bilingual touch (“悬在半空”) and the controlled modulation from analytical to numinous as she immerses in the wax give the voice individuality. There are no POV slips or explanatory asides that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet coherent with Elara’s long-trained, ritual-focused mind, sustaining a distinct, contemplative texture throughout. Diction (“furiously tranquil,” “vortex inheritance,” “cellular memory”) is consistent and gives the prose a recognizably singular timbre. POV control is steady; we remain inside her conceptual frame without unmotivated omniscient leakage or register breaks. Rhythmic modulation—long, sinuous sentences easing into sharper crystallizations at the end—supports the accumulative drive and the final conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well modulated, marrying technical vocabulary (“microclimate sensors,” “atmospheric instability”) with gently lyrical turns (“the solstice hush had settled…like a held breath”). Elara’s perceptual signature—attention to minuscule shifts in air and pressure—feels consistent and character-rooted. There is no head-hopping or register clash, and the narrative distance tightens effectively around the key beats (approach of the front, finger on the switch). The voice is distinctive without calling undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and clearly inflected by the janitor’s contemplative perception, with strong rhythmic sentences and a distinct reverent register. Psychic distance remains stable, smoothly blending close focus with cosmic-scale reflection.

Still, the voice is confident and memorable, well-suited to the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Mira’s observational nature, with metaphors that mostly feel rooted in her perception (“like the ribs of some ancient, docile creature,” “moth wings against a summer lamp”).

There is no head-hopping or register clash, and the rhythm modulates appropriately around key beats (the ghost’s appearance, the box’s discovery, the final stillness). It’s distinctive and confident without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)

Syntax and diction show control, with a measured, almost ceremonial rhythm that suits the contemplative mode. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains stable. At times the abstraction and high-register phrasing risk homogeneity, but overall the perceptual signature feels distinct and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the poet’s sensibility, with a distinct attentiveness to crafted objects and subtle shifts in light. Syntax and rhythm are well controlled, varying between longer, meditative sentences and tighter descriptive ones, matching the contemplative mode. Diction choices like “harmonizing discord” and “burnished hush” feel of a piece with the focalizer. The one notable weakness is occasional slide into meta-expository register when articulating what “the poem would argue,” which slightly flattens the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a contemplative, educated caretaker who keeps a detailed botanical diary. Diction (“sacred geometry,” “subtle conductivity,” “redistributing her energy”) is elevated but consistent and character-appropriate, with no POV leakage or head-hopping. Rhythm varies nicely between long, flowing descriptive sentences and shorter, declarative insights. There is room for slightly more idiosyncratic turn of phrase to make the voice unmistakable, but it is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits an intellectually inclined scientist undergoing a metaphysical crisis. Diction (“bronze quiet,” “luminous skepticism,” “alchemy of pilgrimage”) creates a distinct texture without major register slips, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Repetition of key phrases (“artificial pilgrimage,” “chemistry of homecoming”) reads as deliberate motif rather than clumsy redundancy, though it edges toward over-insistence in the last third. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and unified, even if modulation under peak beats could be slightly more varied.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, elevated, and tightly aligned with the mythic, liminal status of the coachman. Metaphors (reef ribs, drowned cities, treaties in bird calls) feel of a piece and create a distinct perceptual signature. There’s occasional drift toward essayistic climate language, but it doesn’t fully break the voice. POV distance is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is steady, confident, and suitably lyrical for the reflective, post-apocalyptic frame. Diction like “wild hush,” “metal labyrinth,” and “tinted revelations” gives the prose a distinct texture that feels linked to the character’s sensory acuity and history. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage; interior access and narrative distance remain controlled. At times, the register leans a bit elevated for someone framed as a practical scavenger, but the consistency of tone and rhythm makes it feel like an intentional, stylized consciousness rather than a slip.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and suitably elevated for literary SF, with consistent access to Mira’s perceptions and thoughts. Diction and rhythm generally feel deliberate and controlled, giving the prose a coherent texture without head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing trends toward generic “literary” register rather than a sharply idiosyncratic Mira-specific idiom, but it never breaks plausibility for an accomplished scientist-philosopher type. The psychic distance is managed cleanly and modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is assured and mostly consistent, with image-rich yet controlled diction that suits the fantastical setting. Caelius’s perceptual signature—attuned to sky anomalies, carved detail, and Seraph’s affect—feels coherent. Dialogue is sparse but mostly natural, if slightly formal; Seraph’s “This is impossible” is a clean, motivated reaction that advances both plot and worldbuilding. The meta interruption (“Wait—I have miscounted and must begin again”) is intriguing but under-integrated, reading more like a drafting seam than a designed POV or structural gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct cadence and conceptual vocabulary that feel specific to Mira’s sensibility. Syntax varies well, and the narrative slides between present action and reflective summary without losing temporal footing. Figurative language (“the gallery whispered it back in a thousand fractured voices”) supports mood and concept rather than obscuring sense. There are no POV leaks or register jolts, and the voice sustains pressure elegantly across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon of glass, stone, and weather (“quiet certainty of thunder,” “digestive tract of knowledge”) that feels specific to this world and character. POV distance is stable; we never slip into knowledge the seer could not plausibly infer, and the keeper is rendered from her vantage without head-hopping. The prose modulates well—denser and more image-rich around visionary and realization beats, calmer in the seven-night consideration stretch. A few turns of phrase lean generalized (“a vocabulary of healing”) but overall the perceptual signature and rhythm are strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, slightly formal diction that matches Mira’s cerebral, pattern-driven sensibility. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and metaphors (time as amber, thunder as a held breath) feel of a piece with the world. There is no dialogue to test speech differentiation, but the narrative stance remains stable and apt. The voice is distinct and polished, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and coherent with Sera’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic variation and precise lexical choices (“forged hush,” “word-weaver, truth-shatterer”). Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-distinguishing, especially the child’s simple formulations set against Sera’s more layered responses. The narrative stance maintains a consistent distance and doesn’t leak into exposition; reflection flows from concrete triggers. There’s just a trace of authorial thesis-voice in a few lines, but it doesn’t fracture POV.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon that blends technical craft (“pressure seals,” “copper hull”) and metaphysical reflection. The perceptual filter is clearly that of an aging, hyper-competent alchemist whose mind naturally moves between material detail and philosophical inference. Rhythmic variation generally matches emotional intensity, with longer sentences in reflective beats and tighter phrasing around the warnings from the sea. There are a few moments where the register verges on essayistic abstraction, but they don’t break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and convincingly aligned with a sensitive, reflective painter. Syntax and diction show rhythmic control and a distinct texture (“where the light went to hide from the world above”) without feeling mannered. The narrative distance stays stable, with smooth movement between perception and reflection. A few abstract formulations (“temporary eternity,” “illusion of surrender to the exhausting pretense of choice”) edge toward conceptual rather than sensorial, slightly thinning the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not overwrought register that fits Mira’s sensibility and the quasi-mystical premise. Phrasings like “flares bursting like wounded stars” and “screaming tenderness of her belief” create a distinct texture and perceptual signature. The narration stays within what Mira can infer, without unmotivated omniscience, and psychic distance is steady. A small portion of diction (“verbal equivalent of grasping hands”) leans toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t significantly disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct lyric texture that feels suited to Mara’s sensibility: phrases like “patchwork navigator” and “geography of loss” create a recognizable perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays stable, and sentences modulate rhythm between expansive description and tighter action without losing clarity. Occasional analytical intrusions (“Mara understood immediately. This was reverse migration…”) are mostly in-character but tilt toward essay rather than pure scene. Overall, the voice is coherent, confident, and memorable enough to sustain the short form at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Mira’s forager training and pre-virus emotional memory. Syntax and rhythm vary well, sustaining an almost essayistic density without losing clarity, and the neurologist/backstory passage feels integrated with the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward sea, light, and memory. Phrasing like “borrowed memories settling into his bones like tide marks on stone” feels both character-appropriate and tonally unified. Narrative distance remains stable, and the reflective register matches Aldric’s contemplative disposition. Occasionally the voice leans toward generalized abstraction, but it never breaks POV plausibility or slips into jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with an observational lexicon that suits a lifelong map-handler and the slightly archaic, occult feel of a defunct foundry chip. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, carrying both exposition and atmosphere without obvious scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)

POV distance is stable, with reflective lyricism that still feels like immediate thought rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and diction are modulated to match emotional intensity, and the perceptual signature—obsessed with timefolds, recursive images, and memory—is unmistakable. The unreliable sense of time is consistent and purposeful, enriching rather than confusing the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elena’s sensibility; diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional. The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance, modulating gently as reflection deepens without any POV leakage. One glaring line-level slip (“The humanize through occluded views...”) jars both grammatically and tonally, briefly breaking the illusion of an impeccable voice. Aside from that, the voice is distinctive and well suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with storm and ritual metaphors reflecting her mindset. Rhythm and diction are controlled and apt for a reflective, high-fantasy-tinged piece; there’s no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive: lyrical without losing clarity, with metaphors that feel organic to Eleanor’s sensibility (gossip-column exorcist, pruning, letters never sent). POV remains stable and modest in its claims, never slipping into unjustified omniscience. Dialogue is spare but effective; Margot’s few lines carry subtext and differentiate her voice via a slightly cooler, declarative cadence. Rhythm modulates well—longer, more sinuous sentences for atmosphere; tighter phrasing at emotional peaks and the fading-current beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)

Phrasing like “wanderingly exact movements” and “a book being read by a ghost” gives the narration a distinct texture. Psychic distance is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or register clash. The one limitation is a relative uniformity of tone; modulation under pressure isn’t yet tested because pressure never spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confident, controlled, and distinctive, blending wry observation with lyrical compression; the logistician’s jokiness and the woman’s flatness are cleanly differentiated in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mira’s technical familiarity and quiet, observant nature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly economical, with just enough lyricism to suit the quasi-mythic frame without drifting out of her plausible lexicon.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically elevated, and well-matched to a character whose inner life is saturated with cosmic metaphor. Rhythm and syntax show control, with cadences that slow appropriately around the pivotal surrender.

    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in music metaphors and bodily sensation (“each flake a small white note in the world’s most patient symphony”). Diction is elevated but feels plausible for a former choir singer steeped in spiritual and artistic language; it doesn’t slip into alien academic register. The narrative distance stays admirably stable, moving smoothly between Marcus’s immediate sensations and reflective insights.

Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, allowing both long, meditative sentences and crisp declaratives at key emotional beats. Occasional clinical terms (“somatic markers,” “trauma books,” “nervous system”) fit her plausibly book-informed, introspective mindset and do not break distance. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits a speculative literary frame and Kira’s contemplative role. The prose maintains a coherent psychic distance, blending her perceptions with a lightly lyrical narration. Some phrases feel generic or slogan-like (“contraband truths,” “dangerous liaison letter,” “everything changed”), which occasionally dulls the distinctiveness of the voice. Overall, POV control is solid, but the perceptual signature could be more idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyric, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature filtered through Mira’s sensibilities (“sand that remembered water,” “weaving continuity through chaos”). Diction is elevated but controlled and appropriate to the meditative, reflective mode. The narrative distance holds steady, and there’s no head-hopping or register break. A few phrases (“senselessly perceptive”) flirt with abstraction, but they don’t materially harm the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches Morwen’s contemplative, seasoned perspective (“a place where the boundary between hearing and seeing had torn open like wet paper”). Diction stays coherent, and the narrative distance is well controlled, allowing both mythic reach and grounded sensory detail. There’s no dialogue to test, but internal narration carries subtext and atmosphere effectively. A few spots flirt with ornate phrasing, yet they don’t break voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture—formal but not bloodless, with metaphor and syntax that feel consistent with a hyper-observant, highly educated media heiress. The narrative distance is stable and apt; we stay inside Eleanor’s filtered perceptions without head-hopping, and reflective passages are anchored in present sensory cues. Patterned diction around astronomy and archives reinforces character and theme rather than feeling like generic lyricism. There’s a slight tendency toward elevated abstraction (“constellations of meaning”) but it fits her mind and doesn’t blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a confident, lyrical register that fits the speculative-conceptual frame. Diction (“meteor hush,” “architecture of ancient grief,” “current of pure intention”) is elevated but coherent with Mira’s introspective, almost ritualistic mindset and doesn’t break POV credibility. Rhythm varies well between long, image-rich sentences and tighter, declarative ones at key turns (e.g., discovering the date of the firmware, entering the folded-time chamber). There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the prose feels like one controlled perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy voice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrically elevated, and consistent, with strong rhythmic control (“like water finding its path through scorched stone”). POV is mostly tight to Lysara, with small omniscient tilts (survivors’ whispers about Soren) that don’t disrupt coherence. Diction feels unified—geometric, sacred, and sensory language all serve the same aesthetic and thematic register. The single spoken line is sparse but effective; overall, the voice is distinctive without becoming mannered enough to obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara experiences senses and time. Phrasing like “time moved strangely through her, fractured timeline upon fractured timeline layering like the sheets of a song never quite finished” shows both stylistic ambition and control.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping, heat signatures, and emotional residue. Diction leans elevated/lyric but feels aligned with Maren’s quasi-scientific, quasi-mystical perspective, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach what she can plausibly infer. Rhythm and syntax show control, with longer, flowing sentences that fit the meditative mode. There’s no head-hopping or register whiplash, and the phrase “factually mystical” nicely captures the story’s epistemic tension in her idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct texture of elevated yet controlled diction that suits the quasi-sacred archival setting.

There is no head-hopping or register clash, and the narrative distance remains appropriately intimate without slipping into self-conscious commentary. The main limitation is a tendency toward similar cadences and abstractions in reflective passages, which slightly mutes dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is consistent, with a controlled, meditative rhythm suited to the character’s temperament and the story’s aims. Diction choices like “palimpsest,” “ambient awareness,” and “spindrift serenity” fit an elevated, reflective register that feels intentional rather than arbitrary. The perceptual signature—measuring time by gutters, reading mood in fog, holding a yarn needle as talisman—is distinctive. A bit more variation in rhythm or texture at key beats could sharpen emotional inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and consistent: lyrical yet controlled, with pottery, light, and memory metaphors forming a recognizable perceptual signature. POV stays tightly bound to Mira while allowing a slightly elevated diction that feels consonant with her contemplative craftsperson’s mind.

Diction like “atomic reflective surface,” “ten thousand years of human and nonhuman coexistence,” and “brittle awakenings” feels unified and character-appropriate rather than generically ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a mild, thoughtful lyricism that fits a trained listener attuned to “spaces between stars.” Diction occasionally drifts into the abstract or explanatory, but it remains plausible for an academically trained specialist. Expository passages about tricksters and subsonic frequencies are clear, though at times they read more like a narrated lecture than embodied perception. Overall, POV control is strong and stable, if a touch more informative than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits Elara’s reflective, driven mind. Diction (“spatial mutiny,” “crystallized silence,” “fallow period”) is elevated yet consistent with the story’s mythic-scientific tone. Psychic distance is managed well—enough access to her fear and determination without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Occasional abstract formulations slightly edge toward essayistic, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is assured and consistent, blending forensic precision (“methodical as a surgeon arranging instruments”) with lyrical introspection in a way that fits Elena’s sensibility. Her perceptual signature—filtering people through emotional geometry rather than features—is distinct and underpins both diction and metaphor choices. There is no head-hopping, and reflective passages are well anchored to present stimuli like the ribbon and quarry. A few moments verge on omniscient generalization about “families of the missing,” but they still feel plausibly filtered through Elena rather than a separate authorial lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, literate, and aligned with an archivist’s sensibility—attuned to maps, legends, and suppressed routes.

Diction like “luminous beads on a dark string” and “a song that had never learned to end” feels plausibly aligned with this specific artist rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving between external detail and reflective insight without confusion or head-hopping. A slight tendency toward elevated conceptual phrasing could, at the high end, risk flattening character-particularity, but it stays on the right side here.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV through Marcus is stable, and his way of noticing—territorial markers, borders, currencies—constitutes a distinct perceptual signature. The prose registers as literary but not overwrought, and Elena’s voice in dialogue is plausibly distinct (brittle humor versus his measured metaphors). The narrative distance and tense are consistent, and reflective passages remain anchored in present stimuli. The only limitation is that at a few peak beats the narration risks sounding slightly authorial rather than fully embedded in Marcus’s mind, but this is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with an introspective scientist-mystic; diction like “predictable chaos” and “architecture of unconsciousness” feels character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly colored by Kaelen’s sensibility as a druid-guardian. Phrases like “warlike serenity” and “frozen confession” provide a distinct texture and conceptual signature. Narrative distance stays stable, with reflective passages anchored in present action (movement through the vortex, planting the seed).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lush, and clearly colored by her unusual embodiment and long stillness, giving the narration a coherent perceptual signature. Syntax and diction suit a lyric, mythic register and remain stable under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and appropriately elevated for a scholar whose inner life is bound to ancient texts and abstractions. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with a good balance between concrete description and lyrical thought. There are no POV slips or distance confusions; the narrative closely tracks Elara’s perceptions and inferences. A slight tendency toward conceptual phrasing in peak beats keeps it just shy of truly distinctive brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and rhythm are consistent with Asa’s ancient, ritualistic world and never slip into jarring registers. The narrative distance sits in a poised close-omniscient that suits the mythic tone. While the voice is more atmospheric than sharply individuated, it is distinctive and well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled rhythm that matches the contemplative, numinous tone. Diction like “cathedral of crystal” and “latent radiance” feels consistent with the narrative stance and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, observant, and textured, with diction that largely matches a thoughtful, scientifically-inclined but emotionally raw narrator. The perceptual signature—seeing graffiti as “sediment,” ivy as veins in “old bones,” abandoned tracks as paths—is strong and consistent. Occasional phrases lean into therapy/essay register (“motivation had shifted,” “first fragile edges of self-forgiveness”), which slightly flattens the otherwise intimate, image-driven voice. Overall, POV control is confident and reliable, with effective modulation between external observation and interior reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (marrying dream-logic with quasi-scientific precision). Occasional abstract or academic phrases (“propagation delays,” “cyclically reversed nature”) risk register drift but are mostly justified by her methodical, documenting temperament. Psychic distance stays consistent and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous withholding; elision around the second letter pays off conceptually. The modulation from dawn to midnight intensifies rhythm without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensuous, and clearly Elena’s, with a tangible perceptual signature (plants’ whispers, coffee as oracle, textures like velvet and frost). The lyric register holds without slipping into impersonal abstraction, and there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. Rhythms lengthen and compress in step with reflective versus decision beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the numinous subject matter, with a stable focalization through Mira’s professional sensibility. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with her experience and the story’s mode, and there’s no POV leakage or artificial exposition. However, the voice feels more “literary-generic lyrical” than singularly Mira-specific; little in the syntax or idiom could not belong to many similar stories. Sharper idiosyncratic noticing or rhythm would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic setting; phrases like “vineyard hush of that impossible height” distinguish the prose without feeling alien to the world. Psychic distance is consistent and appropriate, maintaining close access to Elara’s perceptions while allowing occasional, gentle omniscient framing. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a good balance of concrete image and elevated abstraction, and no head-hopping or register shocks. The main constraint is that at peak thematic beats the voice slides toward essayistic exposition, which slightly blurs the otherwise distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinct, with phrases like “sincerely insincere patience” and “cloak of doubt” giving it texture. The perceptual filter feels plausibly Mara’s—attuned to nuance, language, and emotional mechanics. There’s a controlled, lyrical cadence without syntactic monotony or POV leakage.

The narrative stance feels unified and confident, though it remains more elevated than idiosyncratically character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrically consistent, with a calm, ceremonial cadence well matched to an immortal observer attuned to geology and echo. Third-person close (with a touch of omniscient register) holds steady, and the diction—“historically reverent,” “resonances,” “geological time”—feels coherent with her vast patience and role. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative never slips into jarring contemporary or technical registers. It’s distinctive and controlled, though not quite so idiosyncratic or surprising in its turns of phrase as the very best literary voices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with a consistent, mildly elevated register that suits Mira’s contemplative nature and the quasi-academic setting.

    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to a contemplative SF vignette. Diction is controlled and mostly character-coherent, with recurring lexical choices around wavelength, static, and contraction that deepen her perceptual signature.

No POV slippage or stance confusion undercuts the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly inflected by Melencolia’s sensibility—astronomical and cartographic metaphors feel native to her world.

There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and psychic distance stays consistently intimate yet slightly formal, matching the “distant intimacy” brief.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)

    The first-person voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated register that fits a disciplined, metaphysically-trained fighter. Diction and rhythm are generally smooth, and the narrative stance remains within what this character could plausibly know and think.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and deliberately ceremonial, matching the mythic framing of the conductor’s role. There is a consistent poetic cadence and lexicon (“mechanical resurrection,” “mournfully eager") that feels intentional rather than haphazard. At times, the omnisciently abstract narration speaks more like an essayist than a character-tethered consciousness, which slightly distances us from embodied experience. Still, the voice is distinct, controlled, and carries the haunting tone effectively through to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinct, with a strong, recognizable cadence and lexicon (“honey through gauze,” “boundaries of light,” “dimensionally homesick”). The narrative distance stays stable and appropriate for a dreamy, lyric mode, and the diction feels intentional rather than random ornament. The voice modulates slightly as she shifts toward acceptance, with the tone brightening without losing its misty texture.

    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent with Mara’s reflective, educated sensibility; diction like “successive approximation” and “creative destruction” fits the character and world. Rhythms are varied and purposeful, modulating between long, meditative sentences and shorter, decisive ones around the climax. The narrative stance maintains appropriate certainty, never straying into information Mara couldn’t plausibly frame, and the interior-exterior balance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Mara’s technical yet wonder-prone mindset. Phrases like “shard of hush,” “serenely electric stillness,” and the fragment “remembering” being something greater give the prose texture without overwhelming clarity. There are a few slightly generic or explanatory touches (“devastating in its implications,” “something far more profound”) that flatten the otherwise distinctive cadence. Overall, though, diction, rhythm, and psychic distance are well controlled and apt for the story’s blend of speculative science and quiet mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in Maren’s blend of practical competence and wonder (“measure journeys by the quality of silence between stars”). Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the cosmic-technical register (hourglasses, radios, spectral geography) feels cohesive rather than stitched. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience beyond what a close third can reasonably infer. Occasionally diction leans a touch abstract (“interconnected strands of frequency and static”) but it still aligns with her specialized role.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and distinctly inflected by the architect’s professional, quasi-scientific sensibility (“tensile strength of intention itself,” “rational enchantment”). Diction and rhythm support a lucidly lyrical tone without tipping into incoherence, and there is no POV leakage or unnecessary explanatory hand-holding. The prose modulates well from calm description to charged surrealism while keeping us inside her interpretive frame. It’s distinctive and controlled, even if it doesn’t quite achieve the singularity of an unforgettable signature style.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Mira is steady and controlled, with a lyrical but not overwrought register that fits both her vocation and the speculative frame. The voice maintains a consistent blend of technical and poetic diction (“edge geometry,” “bioluminescent haze,” “sea of its own”) without jarring shifts. Occasional exposition about the aliens’ mathematics feels smoothly integrated into her perspective rather than like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly lyrical texture that suits Elena’s profession and the liminal premise, with well-controlled phrases like “shadows pooled like spilled ink” and “grief made scientists of us all.” POV is stable, and the narrative distance stays coherent, moving smoothly between external detail and Elena’s interpretive lens. Occasional higher-register generalizations (about ethics, grief, or heroism) feel natural to this reflective voice, though they sometimes flirt with over-explanation. Overall, the voice feels confident and consistent enough to carry publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited POV is steady and controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated lexical register that fits a scientifically minded protagonist in a weird environment. Sentences have a good rhythmic variation, and the lyrical mode remains intelligible under conceptual pressure. Elara’s disembodied “voice” is cleanly distinguished as transmission rather than a competing POV.

The third-person close POV stays stable; we never leave Elara’s lens, and the diction aligns with a quasi-mythic, timeless register.

Sentences have a controlled, rolling rhythm that suits the fable-like tone, and focalization remains coherent even as the camera widens to the community. There’s a distinct narratorial sensibility in phrases like “a ghost whose presence felt less like haunting than like the first warm breeze after a long winter.” The same distance that gives the prose its poise, however, also limits deep access to any one consciousness.

Occasionally the narration drifts toward abstract summary (“deep, immediate, and impossibly vast” understandings) rather than fully embodied perception, which slightly mutes immediacy.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured, with a consistent perceptual signature centered on vibration, flow, and quiet architecture. Phrasing like “smoothing of hush itself” and “mapping of silence” feels both character-specific and thematically aligned. There are occasional high-register or ornate touches (“terrestrially cosmic truth”) that risk drawing attention to the prose, but they don’t fracture POV plausibility in this quasi-mystical context. Rhythm varies well across sentences, and the narrative distance stays controlled and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)

Expository passages compress complex ideas without sliding into flat Wikipedia voice, and POV boundaries remain firm.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)

Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and perception is largely anchored in her sensory and conceptual lens (runes, geometry, sealed awakenings).

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyrical, slightly archaic, and suffused with observational precision that fits a cartographer and this mythic setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring pattern-language and shell imagery giving the narration a coherent texture. Psychic distance is steady, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few lines verge on ornamental density, but they don’t break control or obscure perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and plausibly aligned with an intellectually rigorous historian; the elevated diction feels motivated by her profession and temperament. Sentences are generally well-shaped with a recognizably reflective, almost essayistic rhythm. At times the register veers toward abstract academic phrasing, which slightly distances us from immediate experience and blurs her individual perceptual signature into generalized commentary. Still, POV is stable and reliable, and the voice carries the piece without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-calibrated to Maren’s sensibility, with distinctive turns of phrase that feel cohesive (“shore’s slow surrender,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” “hushed blaze”). Diction is elevated but believable for an introspective professional observer, and the narrative distance remains consistent. The prose modulates with the scene’s pressure—the opening more descriptive, the middle more reflective, the ending tightening around her decision. It stops short of truly singular audacity in voice, but it’s already at a level most serious markets would find compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, with a calm, intellectual register that aligns with Mira’s methodical temperament and the piece’s contemplative mode. Rhythm and diction generally feel intentional and polished, and the focalization remains stable. Minor glitches (“construct alternatif hypothesis,” “official文字”) nick the illusion of complete mastery and add a faint sense of artifact rather than character-specific lexicon. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct but could be fractionally tighter and cleaner to reach top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that merges Mira’s sensibility with a lightly omniscient lyric register. Syntax and rhythm vary with emotional intensity, and the elevated diction (“luminous torment,” “resonant reconfiguration of grief”) feels native to the world rather than grafted on. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays stable. A tiny reservation is that the register is uniformly high, with few moments of roughness or plainness to create additional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is strong, consistent, and idiosyncratic: clinical language (“perturbation theory applied to existential crisis”) braided with visceral, almost mystical imagery of the geode and ruins. The perceptual signature—seeing everything as calculations, potentials, and aborted futures—is distinctive and sustained. Register remains plausible for a hyper-analytic survivor, and psychic distance is controlled, allowing both cool description and raw flashes (“humiliates the gravity of survival”). A few phrased-as-theses sentences nudge toward didacticism but don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches Mira’s sharp, wonder-prone perception. Diction like “frequency of belonging,” “brilliant and dim at once,” and “always catching the world in the act of revealing itself” feels of a piece with this character and world rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is well-managed, sliding between concrete observation and interior reflection without confusion. A few abstract formulations at the end flirt with essayistic summarizing, but they don’t break the POV or overall voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Maren’s, with a strong perceptual signature in how she reads objects as stories and guilt. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with well-managed long, flowing sentences that suit the reflective, melancholic mode. Diction is elevated but coherent with her intelligence and profession, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. A slight tendency toward repeated constructions and abstractions keeps it just below standout-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and assured, with a measured, lyrical cadence that matches the reflective, charged hush of the scene. Diction choices like “between-spaces,” “patient earth,” and “hush that follows a storm” feel character-appropriate for a practiced negotiator who thinks in cycles and terrain, rather than purely authorial. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual—“I wasn’t sure you would come” / “Neither was I”—and the narrative distance stays consistent without head-hopping. There is occasional abstraction, but the overall perceptual signature remains distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Close third-person POV is stable, with a controlled, measured lyricism that fits a former navigator’s reflective temperament. The perceptual signature—attention to instruments, poles, tides, and the physics of paddling—is consistent and character-shaped. Diction stays mostly within a plausible educated register for Elara and doesn’t break into alien academic jargon. The voice modulates well from introspective heaviness to the lighter, surprised laughter at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, blending elevated diction with believable access to Vera’s perceptions. The narrative’s metaphoric density (“house with all the furniture removed,” “something made of old lead and cold regret”) carries a distinct texture that fits the speculative-literary mode. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue from the traveler is clean and tonally consonant. The voice occasionally leans toward exposition of theme rather than pure embodiment, but the distance and rhythm remain controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a consistent elevated register that suits the mythic context. Diction choices like “cosmic intimacy,” “eternal moonlight,” and “funeral flames” cohere as a unified aesthetic rather than a stitched collage. There are moments where abstraction and high-flown phrasing slightly distance us from raw feeling, but POV never leaks and the narrative stance feels deliberate. Rhythm and syntactic control are strong, especially in the ritual and scent passages.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the cartomancer’s sensibility, with a strong taste for lush, metaphoric perception. Diction and syntax hold steady and controlled; the narrative distance stays intimate without head-hopping or stance confusion. The rhythm modulates well enough to mark key beats (e.g., the cut, the realization) even within the generally ornate register. A slight tendency toward abstraction in places (“presence not a place”) is the only minor drag on peak sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to Seraph’s patient, contemplative nature. Phrasing like “night that was not night, void that was not void” and the attention to dust, gravity pools, and light patterns give the narration a clear perceptual signature. There’s occasional explanatory distance (e.g., “she realized—work that was not about fighting external darkness but about stitching together the fragmented light within herself”) that slightly flattens mystery and could be made more implicit. Overall, POV control is confident and consistent, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent, distinctive rhythm and diction that fits a mythic/fabulist register. POV is stable and controlled; there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and distance modulates smoothly as the eclipse approaches. The language leans elevated but feels intentional rather than accidentally academic or mismatched. It’s not quite singular enough to be unforgettable, but it’s well-crafted and highly competent.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, moderately elevated, and suited to a thoughtful, observant sentinel. The narrative diction aligns with Elara’s professional, analytical mindset, especially in how she reads angles and coded patterns. There’s solid control of psychic distance, with smooth movement between external observation and interior inference, and no head-hopping. While the voice is effective and coherent, it doesn’t yet feel idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the fable-like, speculative tone, with a clear perceptual signature in its fixation on patterns and light. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied; sentences balance image, concept, and motion without lapsing into clotted ornament for extended stretches. Psychic distance is stable, with only light omniscient touches that feel of a piece with the mode rather than like leakage. The elevated, almost mythic register is a choice that works, though in peak beats it slightly smooths over raw emotional grain.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with a hyper-perceptive, metaphor-driven poet, with patterned phrases like “cartography of scars” and “furiously tranquil” building a distinct texture. Psychic distance is handled well: sentences broaden into philosophical reflection yet remain anchored in immediate sensory stimuli (storm, dome, timer). Diction is elevated but plausible for the character and setting, avoiding jarring register clashes or POV leakage. The only minor limitation is a tendency toward uniform intensity of lyricism, which slightly flattens modulation between peaks and quieter breaths.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice around Varn is consistent in register and plausibly erudite, matching his academic, philosophical identity. Syntax is mostly varied, and the narrative stance remains stable without head-hopping. However, the voice often drifts into essay-like abstraction, explaining stakes and philosophy rather than letting them accrue through scene, which flattens immediacy. There is texture and control, but not yet a distinctively unforgettable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, with Delphine differentiated by action, history, and the musical precision of her speech. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, supporting the meditative tone without becoming monotonous. The prose avoids register drift; elevated diction feels earned and character-compatible. POV remains stable and modest, never claiming knowledge beyond Mira’s plausible reach.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature (music- and time-inflected noticing, attention to mechanism and pattern). Diction and rhythm match both the melancholy tone and Elias’s reflective, meticulous nature, and the worldbuilding exposition is folded into voice rather than feeling like a separate register. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the level of narrative knowledge plausibly tracks what an observing narrator could know about Elias. Occasionally the prose edges toward ornate, but it remains coherent and deliberate rather than drifting into pastiche.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“empirical whimsy,” “seventeen shades of possibility”) that suits both character and world. The narration balances lyrical texture with clear focalization around Mira’s perceptions and professional mindset, avoiding head-hopping or gratuitous explanation. At times, the diction flirts with an authorial, reflective register slightly beyond Mira’s immediate felt experience, but this remains within the bounds of a literary-lyric stance rather than a true POV breach. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose dynamically voiced under gentle pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a contemplative, observant protagonist; diction and syntax have a distinct, lyrical cadence without drifting into abstraction. Perceptual choices—what Marek notices about light, texture, and small shifts—feel character-specific and form a coherent signature. Tense and distance remain stable, and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous authorial intrusion. At times the elevated, essay-like turns of phrase slightly pull away from embodied immediacy, keeping this just below the very highest tier.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, blending scientific terminology with lyrical observation. However, the POV filter occasionally slips into authorial explanation to ensure the reader grasps the thematic parallel, rather than trusting the imagery to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely filtered through the protagonist's artistic worldview. It creates a cohesive mood, though at times the "artist-philosopher" filter distances the reader from the visceral danger of the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, matching the "Great Quieting" premise. However, reliance on filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") and abstract emotional labeling ("language of feeling") creates a layer of distance between the reader and the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently weary and measured, fitting the character well. However, occasional phrasing oddities like "bubble-doubled" break immersion, and the narration tends to over-explain the emotional significance of events rather than trusting the action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and elevated but suffers from repetitive phrasing and a somewhat detached, reportorial distance. The narrative distance keeps the reader observing Mira's virtue rather than inhabiting her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered through high-register abstraction and explanatory interiority ("she understood now what she had to do"). While the "foggy lucidity" tone is maintained, the voice lacks the distinct, grounded perceptual texture of a specific individual in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered strictly through Elara’s designer perspective. The tone balances the scientific and the mystical effectively without slipping into unearned melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV is stable and maintains a consistent, reverent distance. However, the voice occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("whispered in the language of survivors") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical melancholia that suits the surreal setting perfectly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, keeping us close to Elara’s perception without over-explaining the strange world.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre. However, the repetition of specific descriptors ("quietly savvy," "luminous disbelief") breaks the immersion and draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but occasionally redundant ("temperamental temperament"). The narrative distance is stable, though it relies heavily on explanatory interiority to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic descriptors ("honeyed condescension," "ghosts beneath the starlight"). The prose aims for a thriller tone but often slips into purple phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic register but is undercut by the modern, clinical phrasing of "mildly obsessed," creating a jarring tonal clash. The distance is kept quite high, filtering the experience through summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is well-calibrated, blending analytical robotic detachment with poetic observation ("geometries that should not exist"). The narrative distance is maintained effectively, though it occasionally dips into explaining the character's feelings rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, meditative, and appropriately melancholic for the setting. However, the reliance on explanatory reflection ("spoke to my understanding of how transparency works") creates distance, shifting the mode from dramatic scene to philosophical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara’s reflective distance. The tone matches the pacing well, though the reliance on internal monologue limits the dynamism of the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable and the voice fits the sci-fi genre, though it leans into slightly elevated register. The narrative distance remains controlled, though the emotional interiority is somewhat muffled by technical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but distanced by frequent filter verbs ("she saw now," "she understood then") that tell the reader how to interpret the moment. The tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("gods and mortals") that feels unearned by the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mira's perceptions. The modulation between technical observation and emotional memory is handled well, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective that feels intimate and authoritative.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.0)
    Voice consistency is generally maintained, but the distance slips into diagnostic filtering ("Marcus felt," "He realized," "He understood"). The use of academic terms like "liminal" clashes with the immediate sensory experience of the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably elevated for the mythic tone. While the distance prevents intimacy, the stylistic choices are intentional and executed with competence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately gentle, matching the protagonist's "mellow" persona. However, it occasionally slips into sentimental over-polishing ("fragile and necessary," "unanswered question") that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the emotion through distance or starker imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, suiting the "bronze quiet" of the world. However, it occasionally leans into overwrought phrasing ("mouth that had spoken too much") that draws attention to the writing style rather than the character's experience. The tone holds the scholarly persona well but risks becoming monochromatic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The POV is disciplined, maintaining a consistent filter that blends clinical precision with newfound mysticism. The narrative voice aligns well with Elias's character, though it occasionally slips into slightly standard phrasing when describing his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is assured and consistent, maintaining a meditative, slightly elevated register that suits the "Scholastic" protagonist. The integration of technical, artistic, and liturgical language creates a unique and cohesive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and slightly elevated tone that suits the magical realism genre. The perspective stays close to Elira's unique perception of time. There is a slight tendency toward breathless metaphorical density, but it remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is competent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, frequently interrupting the scene to explain the magic system or the protagonist's psychological state. The tone is consistent, but the distance prevents intimacy with Mira's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the atmospheric content. However, the reliance on filter verbs and explanatory interiority ("Maren's expression transformed," "she questioned with gestures") creates an unnecessary distance between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a precise, observant tone that mirrors the protagonist's profession. The meteorological metaphors ("charged with electricity," "humidity before a thunderstorm") are consistent and enhance the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and melancholic, fitting the mood, but occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("aromatically cautious attention"). The narrative distance remains stable, though it filters the experience heavily through explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, meditative, and lyrical, fitting the "poet" persona. However, it maintains a distinct distance from the immediate action through reliance on filter verbs ("she watched," "she knew," "she thought") rather than direct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately solemn, matching the "magnificent simplicity" of the tone. The shift from external observation to the internal sensation of the music is handled smoothly, creating a cohesive textural experience, though the register occasionally drifts into slight preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, polished lyricism that suits the character’s "affectionate detachment" well. The transition from technical observation to internal reflection is smooth, establishing a stable and distinct POV throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the sentimental tone. Maren's perspective is maintained well, though the voice occasionally smooths over potential grit with elevated, storybook phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like quality of the setting. The transition between the backstory and the present action is handled smoothly, maintaining a unified tone.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and relies heavily on explanatory telling ("troubled her deeply," "understood now what she must do"). This lack of psychic closeness prevents emotional engagement, keeping the reader observing Sera's realization rather than experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately contemplative for a conjurer. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("she thought," "she understood," "she had come to believe") that creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly interpretive, functioning as a "helpful narrator" that explains significance instead of trusting the scene. The phrasing occasionally drifts into opaque abstraction ("colonized its substance").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, meditative, and appropriately detached, fitting the protagonist's scientific worldview. The modulation of psychic distance—from the clinical observation of the leaf to the intimate admission of fear—is handled with assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "haggard" tone. However, it occasionally slips into purple prose ("pool a congregation," "defiance of entropy") that distances the reader from Mira's immediate physical experience. The POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic fable quality that suits the content. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("Varen noticed," "He felt," "He tried to see") which creates unnecessary psychic distance, but the tone is stable and authoritative.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a suitable distance for the mythic tone. However, the integration of specific prompt phrases like "reactively visionary" slightly stiffens the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive tagging ("analytically artistic mind," "artistic spirit") that distances the reader. The tone hovers in a register of "trembling certainty" that feels performative rather than grounded in the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The shift from clinical observation to emotional connection is reflected in the voice, though the "skeptic" persona softens a bit too quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register that fits the premise well. However, the climax relies on distancing filter verbs ("Elian felt," "Elian saw," "he understood") that reduce immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, suiting the somber setting. However, the use of filter verbs ("Elena understood," "What Elena knew") creates unnecessary psychic distance in moments that demand immediacy. The tone balances the clinical and the emotional well.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "magical realism" tone with a polished, albeit slightly purple, register. The point of view remains stable, though the reliance on expository interiority creates a distance that muffles the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, rhythmic quality that suits the setting well. The tone balances the surreal and the gritty effectively, though the psychic distance keeps emotional intimacy at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person perspective. However, the sudden identification of the "ephemeral compass" strains POV logic, as the character has no source for this specific term.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly helpful, frequently summarizing the significance of objects and actions ("represented everything at stake") instead of trusting the reader to infer meaning from the scene. The reliance on expository backstory ("Mira's grandmother had taught her") interrupts the present momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reflective, fitting the solitary protagonist. However, it suffers from a slight "filter" distance ("she preferred to think," "she realized"), keeping the reader in her analysis of the moment rather than the raw sensory experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "fable" tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple descriptors ("magnetic in the misty silence"). Narrative distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly suited to the protagonist’s analytical nature. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly inside Miriam’s interpretive framework.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric ("wild hush," "marrow"). There is a slight reliance on filtering verbs ("Eliorn understood," "She felt") that creates distance, but the mythic tone generally supports the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, fitting the "sunken cathedral" tone. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("tenderness of a lover's farewell"), and the emotional distance remains slightly academic despite the high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and mythic, suiting the fable-sequel nature of the story. The third-person limited POV stays firmly with Marcus. However, the voice is occasionally disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which breaks the natural rhythm of the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is generally strong and atmospheric, but the phrase "ephemeral cameo appearances" breaks the gothic register with anachronistic cinematic language. The POV shift to the gardener is handled smoothly, maintaining emotional continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but maintains a fable-like distance that limits emotional immediacy. The reliance on abstract summaries of Maren's state ("belief that even the most shattered traditions...") creates a barrier to intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, establishing a reverent tone that suits the material. However, the consistent "enchanted" distance prevents a more visceral engagement with the physical labor and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the nostalgic setting. It occasionally risks becoming overwrought ("creature surfacing from water"), but the tone generally supports the magical realist elements without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," over-explaining the significance of every action and thought. The tone is overly reverent and lacks the distinct perceptual bias or grit of a character truly living in a dangerous political climate. The narrative distance remains too comfortable, filtering immediate experience through interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "cryptic medium" persona. Control over psychic distance is steady, though the tone occasionally drifts into flowery introspection that softens the edges of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, effectively managing the "dreamlike" quality without losing clarity. The shift to interpreting the child's drawings is handled with a steady hand, maintaining the single POV while allowing the child's experience to surface.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the pensive tone. The shift from Mira's internal perspective to the collective experience of the crowd is handled smoothly, maintaining distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical, contemplative voice suits the setting well. However, filter verbs ("she recognized," "she understood") and a jarring usage error at the climax ("felt herself bewitch") disrupt the established control.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the fable-like dystopian tone. However, the reliance on repetitive tagging ("candidly cryptic") and slightly elevated adjectival strings creates a distance that occasionally feels more performative than intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and unified, fitting the "poet" persona. However, it suffers from a detached, writerly filter that interprets experience for the reader ("peculiar reef-shadow joy") instead of immersing them in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The distance is well-managed, keeping the focus on the atmospheric portrait without unmotivated slips.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("pulse with borrowed light"). The dialogue ("You unsnarl it") feels unnatural and stiff, breaking the immersive tone established by the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying excessively on filter verbs ("She realized," "She reflected," "She understood") that dilute immediacy. The POV frequently summarizes emotional states instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a melancholic but precise tone throughout. It skillfully blends scientific terminology with emotional reflection, though it occasionally slips into overly polished aphorisms that distance the reader from the raw feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, suiting the surreal atmosphere. It occasionally relies too heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") to convey internal states that could be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a lyrical, reverent tone appropriate for the setting. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("fever dream dreamed," "mathematicians of wonder") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distanced by frequent filter verbs ("She saw," "She felt," "She watched"), particularly in the climax. This layering separates the reader from the raw sensory experience of the memories.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, polished, and appropriately detached, matching Marek's analytical nature. The distance is controlled well, maintaining a consistent filter through his "lightly attentive" perspective. However, the voice leans heavily on abstract summarization, which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the trick.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a polished, mythic register appropriate for the genre. However, the high level of lyrical distance prevents intimacy, keeping the reader observing the ritual from afar rather than inhabiting the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a controlled, meditative tone appropriate for the character. The psychic distance is stable, though somewhat remote, filtering the world through a lens of settled wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, often merging the character's perspective with authorial summation. The tone feels overly polished and melodramatic ("terrible beauty of controlled burns") for the grounded reality of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly academic and distant, suffering from "helpful narrator" syndrome where every action is immediately explained and interpreted. The distance prevents any visceral connection to the protagonist's experience. The POV filters the world through a lens of generalized summary, obscuring the "parallel timelines" element which feels like an unverified assertion rather than a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistently melancholic and attuned to the genre's demands. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose, and the control of narrative distance is functional rather than masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly detached tone appropriate for the fable-like content. The third-person limited perspective is stable, though it prioritizes poetic summary over immediate, embodied experience during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and dignified, fitting the high-stakes diplomacy, though it occasionally slips into abstraction ("particular geometry of a loss"). The narrative distance is stable, keeping the focus tightly on Maren’s internal and external experience.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("silenced her thoughts," "music... fade entirely"), creating a distance from the character's immediate experience. The tone feels performative, prioritizing poetic effect over grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice aims for a poetic register but relies on clunky, diagnostic phrases like "bodily poetic grace" that tell rather than show. The narrative distance is too close to the character's own self-mythology, lacking the critical or ironic gap needed to give her struggle weight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the "urbane" character profile with an elevated, slightly dense register. However, the psychic distance occasionally feels too great, filtering the experience through intellectual abstraction ("half-lit epiphanies," "architectural husk") rather than immediate sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, but it suffers from the repetition of specific phrasing ("esoteric realist," "cadence"). These repetitions reduce the distinctness of the narrative voice, making it feel slightly mechanical in its adherence to prompt keywords. The distance remains controlled, but the lexicon occasionally drifts into ornamental territory.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately meditative for the setting. There are moments of slight over-writing, but the narrative distance is generally well-controlled and suits the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic confidence that suits the "dream archaeology" subject matter. The shift from observation to the sudden, stark declaration of the final line feels less like a stylistic choice and more like an abandonment of the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice generally maintains a suitable mythic tone, but is disrupted by jarring anachronisms like "subsonic frequency" and "pattern-consciousness." These slips break the specific ancient atmosphere established by the clay tiles and oil lamps.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice struggles to integrate the conflicting tonal elements, jarringly mixing quasi-scientific terms ("cellular memory") with high-flown poetic abstraction ("architecture of bitterness").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fable-like distance is consistent but emotionally muted, keeping the reader at arm's length. The voice is uniform, failing to modulate rhythm or intimacy to signal the climax or the significance of the final vision.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, maintaining a cohesive mood suitable for the setting. However, it leans heavily on filter verbs ("she thought," "she understood") and explanatory interiority that creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a slightly elevated, lyrical tone that suits the subject matter. Control over psychic distance is solid, though the voice occasionally slips into "writerly" phrasing that prioritizes sound over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated scholarly tone that suits the protagonist and the "arcane" subject matter. The texture is cohesive, though the polish is slightly marred by the text artifact noted in the prose category.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, suiting the dreamlike logic of the story. The high-register diction ("palimpsest," "double exposure") fits the specific intellectual and emotional interiority of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately academic, suiting the archivist persona. However, the verbatim repetition of the tag "warmly methodical" suggests a lack of confidence in the characterization, relying on telling the reader how to feel about Elena.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a somber, mythic tone appropriate for the setting. However, it occasionally relies on slightly breathless phrasing ("agony," "soul") that distances the reader slightly from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, fitting the "post-collapse" tone well. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") that creates distance between the reader and the immediate experience. The POV remains stable, but the internal monologue often drifts into explanation rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately elevated for the subject matter. The POV remains firmly anchored in the archivist's perspective with no head-hopping. The tone effectively balances the fantastical elements with a meditative, scholarly register.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical fable register that suits the subject matter. The shift into the "counting chant" provides a nice rhythmic texture that distinguishes Mira's internal voice from the broader narration, though the narration occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on filtering ("she understood," "she realized," "she felt"), creating unnecessary psychic distance. The text explains the character's internal state rather than dramatizing it through perception and immediate reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("susurrus of invisible growth"). The reliance on oxymorons and abstract descriptors creates a distance that prevents deep immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the magical realism tone. The distance is controlled, maintaining a tight focus on Maren's professional perception while allowing for atmospheric expansion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, though the dialogue from the alternate self feels functional and expository. The tone manages the shift from cynicism to wonder reasonably well, but some phrasing feels slightly overwritten and purple.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("weaving chaos through the bones of order"). The tonal shift from gothic reminiscence to the pseudo-science of "standing waves" is handled reasonably well, though the incompleteness disrupts the final effect.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent, but the phrase "factually mystical" creates a jarring register slip into academic analysis. A typo ("ho whisper," likely "hoarse") in a pivotal moment disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.5)
    The intended lyrical voice is severely undermined by glaring grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("Mara unfurl," "examining unknown the evidence") that disrupt narrative authority and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a serious, slightly elegiac tone appropriate for the genre. Narrative distance is managed well, staying close to Mira’s perception without unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, but it suffers from a heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("radiant grotto," "ancient stones," "vested hush") that create a repetitive rhythm. The tone supports the "high fantasy" vibe but lacks the rhythmic variance needed to build genuine urgency during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic register but stumbles on redundancy ("always emerged transformed always") which disrupts the polish. The grammatical error in the key action beat ("she prod the leaf's surface") breaks the narrative spell and suggests a lack of editorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, effectively conveying the protagonist’s methodical nature. However, the extreme brevity prevents the development of a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm that modulates under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a melancholic but precise tone that suits the alchemist protagonist. The distance is well-calibrated, allowing for deep reflection without stalling the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, maintaining a steady lyrical tone. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("Mira saw something she had never seen before") and summarizing emotional states rather than dramatizing them fully in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice often slips into "helpful narrator" mode, explaining Marcus's abilities (paragraph 2) rather than letting them emerge solely through action. The tone is appropriately atmospheric but occasionally veers into purple prose ("mechanical surrender," "destined to fail").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, suiting the ethereal nature of the setting perfectly. The control of rhythm in the climax ("The rupture came not with sound but with expansion") effectively mimics the event described.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated "baroque" register that perfectly suits the setting. Interior access is deep, though occasionally mediated by filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") that distance the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like tone that suits the subject matter. The distance is well-controlled, though the reliance on explanatory interiority ("He had learned then that some wounds existed...") occasionally flattens the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably atmospheric, effectively maintaining the "searing reverie" tone throughout. The elevated register holds steady, though the reliance on internal summary occasionally distances the reader from the immediacy of the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, maintaining a tone of elevated melancholy that suits the subject matter. However, the score is capped due to the significant text artifact noted in Category 7, which momentarily breaks the narrative spell. Otherwise, the control of psychic distance is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into a lofty, poetic register that creates distance rather than intimacy. The tendency to over-explain internal states ("ancient indifference," "accumulated knowledge") prevents the reader from experiencing the moment directly.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately atmospheric, matching the reverence Elara feels for the station. POV is stable, filtering technical details through her specific professional lens. A few phrasings lean slightly into poetic affectation ("waiting all day to be born"), but the overall tone supports the story's meditative quality.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the meaning of actions rather than allowing them to stand alone. The psychic distance remains remote, summarizing the character's philosophy in complex abstract sentences instead of inhabiting their immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from a heavy reliance on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("understood," "felt rather than heard"). The narrative distance remains somewhat remote, prioritizing poetic description over immediate character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing history and motivation instead of dramatizing them in the moment. The psychic distance feels slightly academic, keeping the reader observing Maren's wisdom rather than inhabiting her physical or emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the reflective mode, but creates distance through heavy filtering ("Elena perceived," "She realized"). The perspective stays firmly with Elena, but the tendency to summarize thoughts flattens the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic quality that suits the fable-like content. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose, and the solemnity feels slightly uniform without modulating for the specific action of planting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into abstraction and poeticism ("fragments of knowledge... like seeds") that creates distance from the immediate physical action. The tone prioritizes lyrical description over the immediate urgency of the protagonist's task.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the character's realizations. Repetitive phrasing ("stretched" appears five times) distracts from the intended contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.7)
    The sudden shift to a first-person meta-commentary ("I have miscounted") disrupts the established third-person distance without prior signaling. This breaks the fictive dream and renders the narrative stance unstable, appearing more like a glitch than a controlled experimental voice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a somber, lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, it suffers from a distancing effect caused by over-reliance on abstract nouns and poetic philosophizing ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") that keeps the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality suitable for the content. Narrative distance is somewhat high, often labeling emotions ("gratitude," "grief") rather than embodying them in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. The close third-person POV effectively filters the world through Sera’s perspective, though some phrasing feels slightly self-conscious when integrating prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable tone of melancholic urgency. There is a tendency toward explanatory filtering ("she understood," "she saw the truth"), which occasionally places a layer of interpretation between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, suiting the subject matter. It maintains a stable third-person limited perspective, though the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("silence he'd made inside his chest").

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, frequently pausing to explain the meaning of events ("This was reverse migration") rather than trusting the dramatization. The "we'll go north" dialogue works, but the surrounding narration dictates the emotional takeaway too rigidly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady control over the narrative distance. It occasionally lapses into "writerly" abstractions ("ravine's throat," "symbiotic secrets"), but the tone effectively supports the solitary, reflective mood.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy tone but leans heavily on adjectival stacking. The "as if she still had subjects" slip indicates a lapse in distance control and character consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overly filtered and distancing, relying on "filter verbs" (Maren understood, Maren recognized) that summarize thought processes instead of dramatizing them. The repetition of the label "scientifically romantic" feels like an artificial prompt insertion rather than a natural part of the narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is distinct and consistently melancholic, fitting the "chronicler" persona. However, the heavy use of metaphorical filters creates a barrier between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans into "precious" literary affectation ("before the world remembered to be loud," "something wanting in"). It maintains a steady, lyrical distance that keeps the reader observing Elena's feelings rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is distinct but drifts into melodrama ("body turned precious") and relies heavily on filter verbs ("realized," "felt," "remembered") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. However, the reliance on simile constructions ("like a held breath," "like a bill," "like stones") creates a repetitive rhythmic cadence that occasionally distracts. Despite this, the POV remains tightly controlled and the sisters' dialogue voices are distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but leans heavily into "purple" description that distances the reader. The tone is uniformly reverent and mythical, lacking the modulation or specific texture that would distinguish a unique narrative perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from heavy filtering, constantly interpreting the scene for the reader ("gesture Mira recognized as reverence"). The tone is elevated but risks sterility by keeping the reader at a cerebral distance through constant analysis of "geometry" and "physics."

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending academic terminology with emotional observation effectively. The prose rhythm is generally controlled, though occasionally the voice slips into overly poetic registers that feel writerly rather than character-driven. The shift from the analytical library scene to the emotional hospital scene is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the melancholic atmosphere. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature, though the heavy reliance on summary creates a slight emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy "writerly" filter, creating distance through elevated diction and expository summary. The narration often explains the character's state ("She understood that the past did not yield...") instead of inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, slightly distant tone that fits the magical realism genre. The shift from the logistician's weariness to the "polite anarchy" of the ending is handled with smooth prose. However, the dialogue occasionally sounds like a vehicle for exposition or prompt requirements ("You're here about the rock") rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately lyrical, maintaining a distinct "high fantasy" register. The elevated tone matches the protagonist's perception, though it occasionally risks monotony by lacking grounded, grittier variations under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the contemplative tone, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory with phrases like "haunted her corridors of thought," which distances the reader from the raw data of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. The shift from internal reflection to the shared moment is handled smoothly, though the narration occasionally filters experience through heavy simile rather than direct sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, favoring "telling" over immediate experience. The repetition of the label "analytically intuitive" disrupts the textual texture and feels like a forced insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the ethereal subject matter, effectively conveying the protagonist's perception. However, occasional purple phrasing ("vomiting stars," "liquid light") threatens to distract from the emotional grounding of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," explaining the significance of every gesture ("giving him the gift of witnessed solitude") instead of trusting the reader to infer it. The tone is cohesive but leans into a solemn, elevated register that distances the reader from the raw immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and unified, maintaining a reverent, fable-like tone throughout. However, the omniscient distance prevents intimacy, and the reliance on "telling" creates a barrier to emotional engagement. The narrative stance is confident but overly explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but tends toward an intrusive, explanatory mode that interprets Maren's feelings for the reader. The narrative distance collapses into abstraction ("world's certainties blurred") rather than staying close to Maren's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is the story's strongest asset, skillfully weaving the "performed" narration for the speakers with the internal monologue. The transition between the mask and the inner self is seamless and justifies the stylistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately poetic, though it occasionally leans into an overwrought register. The POV is stable, but the reliance on internal monologue over dramatic action distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like tone appropriate for the content. However, it leans into sentimentality ("understanding blooming... like the first color"), which softens the edges of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a polished, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the genre. However, the reliance on high-concept terminology and poetic abstractions occasionally creates a barrier to intimacy, feeling more like a fable than a close-POV experience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, suiting the "sanctuary" setting. However, phrases like "carrying the inherited mystery" feel slightly self-conscious, and the narration occasionally summarizes significance ("Maren recognized that look") rather than letting the reader infer it.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a historian, maintaining a cohesive mystical-academic tone. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("I felt," "I understood") distances the reader from the immediate experience. The register slips occasionally into purple phrasing ("uncanny wind," "terrible beauty") that feels slightly derivative.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and suitably lyrical, maintaining a consistent melancholic distance. However, the specific phrasing "softly deliberate" is repeated three times (paragraphs 1, 7, and 9) as a tag, creating a noticeable artifact that distracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the reflective mood. However, it occasionally drifts into slightly melodramatic phrasing ("nature's theater of deception") that feels more like authorial flourish than character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, effectively managing the transition between the medical reality and the magical telepathy. The tone matches the "suspended moment" of dawn well.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately moody, but suffers from "prompt-worditis" where required phrases like "spatially imaginative" are inserted awkwardly as labels. The tone struggles to balance the necessary lyrical quality with natural narrative flow, occasionally feeling stiff.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is cohesive but overly florid ("shadowed rapture"), creating a distancing effect. The reliance on repetitive metaphorical tags for the protagonist's state weakens the distinctness of the POV and feels manufactured.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a lyrical, somewhat elevated register that suits the fable-like quality. However, the reliance on abstract similes occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but overly reliant on filter verbs ("He understood finally," "felt the hum") and abstract summarizing. The tone drifts into purple prose, prioritizing high-concept phrasing over grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but creates excessive distance through high-register abstraction ("slow surrender," "twilight vigil"). The tone matches the allegorical intent but lacks the intimacy and specific texture required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting a former singer with a heightened sensitivity to sound and silence. The prose rhythm mimics the "patient symphony" mentioned in the closure, maintaining a consistent cathedral-like atmosphere. POV remains strictly limited to Marcus, enhancing the intimacy of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, utilizing an elevated "legend" tone that creates a barrier to intimacy. The lack of a specific temporal anchor prevents a distinct perceptual signature from emerging under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and maintains a consistent melancholic yet clinical distance appropriate for a scientist. The modulation of sentence rhythm matches the tapping motif, creating a satisfying textual unity. The voice slips only slightly into essayistic register during the thematic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the clumsy, repetitive insertion of the prompt phrase "awkwardly confident," which appears twice in similar constructions ("awkwardly confident stride," "awkwardly confident certainty"). This repetition breaks the narrative immersion and feels like a mechanical constraint rather than organic character description.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like quality that suits the material. However, dialogue often drifts into exposition to clarify stakes ("The elders say we must rebury it"), and the POV occasionally over-explains backstory to justify current actions, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, suiting the "quiet" nature of the protagonist. The shift into therapy-speak ("somatic markers") creates a slight register clash, momentarily breaking the immersive, poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, dreamlike quality but is undermined by significant copy-editing slips ("an wound," "Mira redesign not"). While the metaphorical consistency is generally good, the narrative distance wavers between immersive perception and explanatory rhetorical questions. The unpolished mechanics distract from the intended atmospheric immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but struggles with the integration of required phrases, leading to awkward repetition of terms like "consciously wild." The tone aims for a high-literary register but occasionally slips into purple prose or tautology to accommodate the prompt elements, damaging the immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic, relying on heavy adjectival modification ("dizzying quiet," "shroud," "small apocalypse"). The tone feels performative rather than grounded in the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the contemplative tone. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("sheathed blade of memory") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady distance that suits the fable-like quality. The use of "transliterate" is a required element and handled functionally, though it reads slightly academic for the established POV. The sensory focus remains consistent and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending elevated, almost gothic imagery ("static like smoke," "darkened star") with precise, analytical diction suited to a newsprint heiress. The shift in tone as the logic puzzle clicks into place demonstrates strong control over psychic distance and character interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, somewhat breathless quality that fits the magical realism of the prompt. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("something more desperate and something less") and relies on high-register abstractions that distance the reader from the immediate action. The tone is cohesive but lacks the modulation needed to distinguish moments of discovery from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is generally consistent and lyrical. However, the phrase "socially perceptive eye" to describe noticing mist is a jarrings category error that reads like a forced prompt insertion, momentarily breaking the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. It occasionally slips into over-explanation of the character's emotions ("understanding bloom," "mercy... crystallized"), reducing the psychic distance and intimacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and firmly anchored in Elara's melancholic perspective. The shift between the ghost's internal experience and the external observation of Mira is handled with controlled narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.7)
    The POV relies on clinical language ("somatic markers," "inner landscape") to summarize emotion, creating an expository distance during what should be an intimate moment. The shift to the "willowglass" metaphor at the closure feels stylistically distinct but tacked on rather than earned by the preceding voice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently stepping in to explain the significance of Maren's feelings. The tone is appropriately reverent but keeps the reader at a distance by summarizing the emotional import of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into elevated abstraction ("particular quality of unearthed silence"). The job title "hourglass turner" clashes confusingly with the actual labor of button sorting, creating a disconnect in the protagonist's professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but marred by the dialogue, specifically the forced usage of "vouchsafe," which shatters the spy-thriller tone. The archaic phrasing in a modern intelligence context creates a jarring register mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the meaning of symbols (the needle) and feelings (the serenity) instead of letting them breathe. This creates excessive psychic distance, keeping the reader observing the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and precious, maintaining a distance that prevents emotional intimacy. The reliance on high-register metaphors ("shape of hours") creates a barrier to the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly precious, leaning on elevated descriptors ("quivering hush") that distance the reader from the grit of the scene. The perspective is stable, but the tone feels constructed to deliver a message rather than arising from a distinct, character-specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, fitting the ethereal setting well. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought abstraction ("ghosts in her blood," "wing beating against glass") that distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably atmospheric for the subject matter. The lyrical style supports the "accumulative" lens, though it occasionally risks distancing the reader from the raw reality of the character's loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and professional, maintaining a steady distance. The voice slips into exposition when explaining the nature of the tricksters ("operated for eons," "feeding on conflict"), which creates a slight distance from the immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic abstraction ("wound in the stone," "hymn of hope"). The integration of the prompt phrase "prudently adventurous" feels mechanical and disrupts the natural cadence of the character's internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and filtered through the protagonist's specific worldview, maintaining a stable distance that suits the sombre mood. The distinction between what is seen (geometry/emotion) and what is missed (features) is handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, leaning into a "storyteller" mode that summarizes rather than inhabits the character's experience. The repetition of prompt phrases disrupts the otherwise stable tone.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" description that distances the reader ("language of luminous disbelief"). The filter verbs ("She saw," "She found") dilute the immediacy of the magical elements. The tone is cohesive but feels somewhat performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the "polished calm" concept. However, the repetition of specific phrases ("dusky harmony" appearing three times) breaks the immersion and makes the voice feel algorithmic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, though it occasionally leans on filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") to explain insights rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a steady, reflective rhythm. However, the distance is sometimes too great, summarizing the character's state (“serene focus of a warrior”) rather than letting the reader experience it through his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, though it relies heavily on filter verbs ("she sensed," "she felt"). The narrative distance remains static, observing the character's internal state rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but marred by significant lexical repetition (three uses of "fiercely gentle" and "impossible" in a short text). This verbatim recycling of descriptors breaks the narrative spell and suggests a lack of distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, blending technical roadie knowledge with the language of appraisal. The perspective stays tightly anchored in Marcus’s worldview, though it occasionally drifts into slightly purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the meditative tone of the piece. However, the distant perspective prevents emotional immediacy, and the voice does not modulate to reflect any shift in pressure or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a suitable fable-like tone throughout. The POV remains firmly anchored in Margret's perspective, effectively filtering the magical elements through her observational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is controlled, distinct, and appropriately textural ("palimpsest of repairs"). The close third-person perspective maintains a consistent distance that suits the observational nature of a chronicler.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly breathless and abstract, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity. The narration leans on "telling" the reader the significance of events ("she understood... with sudden clarity") rather than letting the scene carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and suited to the genre, with a strong rhythmic quality. It occasionally leans into slightly breathless abstraction ("whispered of centuries," "secret wanting to be told"), but the narrative stance remains stable and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a "romantic filter" that distances the reader from the immediate action. The tone is reverent and explanatory, often summarizing the magic system instead of grounding the experience in the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a meditative, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the genre. However, the filter is somewhat distant, summarizing emotional states ("forgiven the unforgivable") rather than grounding them in immediate, visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and suitably weary, maintaining a "sincerely insincere" distance. However, the lyrical density sometimes draws attention to the author's hand rather than the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mythic, fable-like voice is consistent and confident, suiting the subject matter well. The narrative distance is appropriate, maintaining a reverent tone that supports the "delayed revelation" structure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, but suffers from heavy filtering ("she knew," "she sensed," "she understood") that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The narrative distance remains static, observing the character from the outside even while describing her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative, fitting the "quiet keeper" persona. However, the psychic distance collapses into explanatory summary during the climax to ensure the reader grasps the theme, explaining the character's internal state instead of trusting the scene to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is distinct but overwrought, relying on "purple" phrasing ("flickered like distant apologies") that distances the reader. The poetic register feels imposed by the author rather than arising from the character's grounded experience as a laborer.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and meditative but relies on filter verbs ("she perceived," "she understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone risks becoming overly lecture-like when articulating the story's metaphysical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on a repetitive "X like Y" simile structure (five distinct uses in a short space), creating a predictable rhythm. This structural tic draws attention to the writing mechanics rather than the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the material well. The third-person limited POV stays firmly anchored in the mage's perception, successfully blending the magical and the mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on elevated, adjectival phrasing ("crystalline clarity," "accumulated depth") that creates distance. The prose occasionally drifts into "purple" description that prioritizes sound over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw"). The distance is often too close to the author's thematic intent, resulting in "ventriloquism" where the character thinks in polished thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "sentinel" voice is consistent and appropriate for the elevated setting. However, the tone occasionally slips into melodrama ("voice came through like sunlight"), which softens the professional grit required by the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric ("ceremonial knife," "perpetual autumn twilight"), fitting the "warrior monk" archetype. However, the tone leans into melodrama ("altar of dissolution") and the narrator's insights feel overly composed and essayistic for a character supposedly experiencing a crisis of feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical ("origami nightmares," "small revelation"), maintaining a polished literary tone. However, the narration tends toward "telling" internal states ("She was notably receptive"), which distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently stepping in to explain the protagonist's understanding and the meaning of his actions. The tone leans into overwrought poetics ("sacred ground," "mechanical resurrection") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality. The lack of distinct character voice or perspective filter results in a generic, elevated fable tone.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but overly interpretive, explaining the character's psychology to the reader rather than inhabiting it. The distance is too close to the author's thematic intentions and too far from the "feral" character's immediate sensory reality. The tone is cohesive but heavy with "diagnostic label-speak."

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The idiom "the penny dropped" appears twice and clashes jarringly with the high-fantasy alchemist tone. Otherwise, the voice is consistent, though it leans toward elevated abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by uncapitalized proper nouns ("hollywood") and occasionally purple phrasing ("crystalline connection"). The tone wavers between gritty sci-fi and abstract lyricism without fully integrating them.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a dreamlike quality suitable for the genre. However, it occasionally drifts into sentimental abstraction ("heart full of starlight") that softens the impact of the "terrible instability" it tries to convey.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is precise and controlled, mirroring the architect's own "steady hands" and scientific approach to magic. The POV remains firmly anchored, and the elevated register fits the "high art" context without drifting into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a respectful, slightly elevated tone suited to the "somber marvel" of the piece. Dialogue is functional but occasionally drifts into exposition ("You still carry it even now"), and the narrative distance remains somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and moody, fitting the genre, but suffers from over-filtering ("Elena understood," "Elena realized"). The tone occasionally slips into melodrama ("impossible message," "drowning in helplessness") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and focuses appropriately on Maren's sensory experience. The voice suits the genre, balancing technical observation with atmospheric dread.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic and lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the use of filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") creates unnecessary psychic distance in a story that relies heavily on immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("frequencies that made the hair rise"), which distances the reader. The POV is stable with Mira, but the dialogue often sounds like written speeches or aphorisms rather than natural speech, particularly when Amari explains his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic register that suits the fable-like content. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple abstraction ("music made visible") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent but leans into poetic abstraction ("fragments of lives") and melodrama. The voice distance is controlled, but the reliance on sentimental phrasing softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornate, often prioritizing rhythm over clarity. The "silent" nature of the character is told rather than felt through the narrative texture, which is quite loud in its adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished but tends toward the precious ("Euclid would have wept") and over-explains emotional states. The perspective remains stable, though it filters the world through a lens of knowing reverence that lowers tension.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. The distance is well-managed for a summary-heavy style, though this choice distances the reader from immediate emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly polished and "writerly," creating an emotional distance that buffers the reader from the characters' pain. The shift to future-tense exposition in the final third breaks the immediacy of the POV, summarizing potential depth instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its reverent, elevated tone, fitting the high-fantasy genre. However, the distance is significant, filtering the experience through grand descriptors rather than immediate sensory perception. The prose tends toward "purple" abstraction which distances the reader from the physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, effectively interlacing the physical and spiritual elements without breaking tone, though it occasionally skirts purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from excessive narrative distance, explaining the character's interiority ("The implication was clear") instead of inhabiting it. The tone drifts into academic abstraction ("accumulated whispers," "reverence") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the meditative pacing of the dive. However, it relies on over-articulated labels for emotion ("recognition," "sophisticated melancholy") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fable-like genre, maintaining a distinct "driftingly alert" texture. Occasional phrasing leans precious ("tinkersong wonder") but the perceptual signature remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled and fits the atmospheric setting well, maintaining a consistent register. POV remains stable with Mira, efficiently filtering the world through her specific servant-class perspective and history.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the reflective mode, but it occasionally slips into "helpful narrator" mode to explain the symbolism. The perspective is stable, though the scientist's voice clashes slightly with the scientifically dubious "dusty starlight particles" description.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and tonally appropriate but maintains a safe, essayistic distance that tells us what Mira understands rather than showing her process.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a steady, studious tone. Narrative distance is well-controlled, though the emotional range is somewhat narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and respectful of the genre, maintaining a "hushed reverence" tone throughout. However, the breathless quality and high density of "meaningful" adjectives ("celestial calibration," "crystalline understanding") can feel overwrought. The narrative distance remains somewhat remote, observing Thessa's feelings rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.0)
    The omniscient, fable-like voice is consistent but creates significant psychic distance, preventing reader immersion in any specific character's experience. The "we" feel flattens individual distinctness and reduces the narrative to a soothing chronicle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental, relying on "poetic" assertions to dictate emotion ("bruised awe") rather than evoking it through observation. The high-lyric mode creates a distance that muffles the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the "graceless beauty" tone. The transition between the exterior cliff and the interior logic of the labyrinth is smooth, maintaining a consistent psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    The scientific voice is distinct and controlled until the final paragraphs, where the sudden, unearned shift to present tense disrupts the established narrative distance. This instability at the climax undermines the authority of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately elevated for the fable-like quality of the piece, maintaining a cohesive distance. However, reliance on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she understood") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suited to the fable-like quality of the story. However, there is a tendency to explain rather than show, using filter verbs ("she could taste," "she felt") and abstract summaries ("joy or sorrow," "unspoken regret") that distance the reader from the immediate visceral experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, maintaining a cohesive fable-like tone throughout. The narrative distance is controlled, though the prose occasionally drifts into explaining the character's internal state rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a reverent tone, though it relies on distancing filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood"). The perspective stays firmly with Mira, but the "fable-like" distance prevents visceral engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the subject matter ("gossamer," "spectrum"). It maintains a steady third-person limited perspective, though it occasionally drifts into explaining the protagonist's internal state rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, contemplative tone that suits the protagonist. There is a slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she realized") which creates unnecessary distance, but the overall control of POV is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but repetitive, relying on a specific "adverb + adjective" construction ("thoughtfully precise," "carefully folded," "carefully neutral," "thoughtfully accurate"). This tic flattens the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the protagonist's worldview, handling the transition between technical tuning and spiritual reflection well. The prose maintains a steady, meditative rhythm, though the insertion of the prompt phrase "theatrical sincerity" creates a slight register clash with the established sincere tone.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like tone that suits the material. However, the integration of required phrases results in occasional stiffness (e.g., "olfactorily sensitive nose") that disrupts the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a steady observational tone. However, the reliance on elevated, slightly purple descriptors ("crystalline question marks," "whirling silence") occasionally distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is precise, measured, and consistently filtered through the protagonist's technical expertise. The "surgeon through sterile space" simile perfectly captures her detachment. The voice falters only slightly when accommodating prompt-mandated phrases, but otherwise maintains a high degree of control.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The lyrical voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("chromatic truth," "impossible spectra"). The mid-scene POV shift to the distant sculptor disrupts the focalization without earning the omniscience through prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative, though it occasionally strains for effect. The meditative tone holds throughout, aligning well with the "canyon hush" atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and elevated register suited to the genre. However, the voice occasionally drifts into essayistic phrasing ("condition of perception," "architecture of wonder") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV control is steady, and the narrative voice suits the lyrical tone of the piece. However, the dialogue drifts into a lecture mode that feels less like a natural conversation between old friends and more like a vehicle for the author's thematic thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, meditative tone appropriate for the protagonist. However, the register often drifts into "purple" description ("fragmented reassurance," "screaming in a language") that distances the reader. The narrative distance is close, but the filter is heavy with interpretation rather than direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but suffers from "purple" tendencies that distance the reader. The elevated register ("stoically sparkling," "belied the trembling") sometimes prioritizes sounding poetic over clarity, creating a barrier to immediate engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, rhythmic, and appropriately mythic, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. However, the slightly elevated register occasionally drifts into omniscient generalizations that flatten the protagonist's specific, grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and controlled. However, the repetition of the phrase "murmur of half-remembered dreams" (three times) without variation creates a static loop that distracts from the otherwise polished tone.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, frequently summarizing the meaning of events instead of allowing the reader to infer them. The shift into explaining the lighthouse's specific emotional state collapses the psychic distance and removes ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, effectively sustaining the fable-like tone. However, it tends toward explanatory summary ("This was the way of it") which distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The meditative, slightly elevated voice is consistent and well-controlled, fitting the dye master persona and the liminal setting. Narrative distance is stable, though the reflective tone risks becoming sentimental in the absence of active scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a mythic distance appropriate for the genre. The transition from memory to the active "now" is handled smoothly. The voice confidence supports the magical realism elements without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical fable-like quality that suits the mythic scope. At times, the tone creates a slight distance, but the "refraction" imagery aligns well with the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," summarizing the character's psychology instead of trusting the scene. The distance feels too close to the authorial hand, organizing thoughts into neat paradoxes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is overly interpretive, utilizing diagnostic phrases ("creeping normality") that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience. The tone is consistent but leans heavily on explaining Elara's mindset rather than inhabiting it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and reverent, suiting the subject matter well. However, the lexicon feels slightly limited by the recurring use of specific descriptors ("gently meticulous," "quartz hush") which draws attention to the writing itself rather than the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent, but the inclusion of untranslated Chinese text acts as a severe breach of the established English-language focalization and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and established, but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, frequently interpreting the meaning of objects (the compass as a "bridge") and the character's state for the reader rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by tautologies ("mnemonically gifted memory") and a tendency to over-explain emotional states. While the artistic perspective is distinct, the narration often tells the reader what to feel rather than embodying the experience through perception and sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyric, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. However, the tone occasionally drifts into breathlessness or sentimentality ("dust that had forgotten how to be soil") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly explaining the significance of images instead of trusting the reader. The tone borders on monotonous reverence, lacking the modulation of distance or intensity that accompanies dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lyrical voice is strong and consistent, fitting the nostalgic tone well. Narrative distance remains close to Cara’s perception, effectively filtering the world through her hybrid organic-synthetic senses.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and polished, though it leans toward a safe, slightly elevated "workshop" style. Perspective remains firmly with Elena, but the emotional distance keeps the reader observing the feeling rather than experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and lyrical, fitting the "code breaker" persona, but suffers from a catastrophic immersion break with the inclusion of Chinese characters ("方向盘") in the English text. This unmotivated artifact, likely a generation glitch for "steering wheel," shatters the specific narrative distance. Without this error, the voice would be stronger, though it leans toward melodramatic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone, though it suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome" by explaining the significance of every image immediately. The POV remains stable with Mira, but the distance is often too remote to feel her immediate physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent lyrical quality. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with dense metaphorical stacking ("braille made of absence") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elena’s expanding perception. The shift from the mundane to the metaphysical is handled with a steady hand, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature throughout. The tone manages to be eerie yet warm, a difficult balance executed well here.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, handling the lyrical tone well. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Mira felt," "she realized") and expository interiority creates a slight distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone, though it often lapses into breathless adjectival stacking. The narrative distance is somewhat remote, prioritizing philosophical summary over immediate sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.0)
    The established high-fantasy tone is shattered by the jarring insertion of corporate/technical jargon ("progressive disclosure") that conflicts with the character's lexicon. The narrative distance is consistently remote, prioritizing summary and explanation over immediate, sensory-grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its reverent tone but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the character's insights. The psychic distance is too remote to allow for visceral engagement with the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, though it suffers from "label-speak" in moments like "demure audacity" that feel imposed rather than voiced. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Yuki’s worldview, but the tone is sometimes too precious to feel fully authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, intelligent, and consistent, perfectly matching Mira's analytical worldview. The control of psychic distance is strong, though the shift into summary slightly detaches the voice from immediate experience in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the prophetic subject matter. However, the internal monologue occasionally drifts into summarizing Elara's history and philosophy instead of staying anchored in her immediate sensory experience. The perspective is stable, though it sometimes prioritizes poetic phrasing over character-specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished but maintains a high psychic distance that prevents deep emotional engagement. The tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("feral loft," "lonesome splendor") that feels decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the high-fantasy tone, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("immediate and holy") that feels slightly disproportionate to the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the genre but suffers from a monotonous rhythm and emotional distance. The verbatim repetition of the distinct phrase "softly purposeful" in the first and fourth paragraphs breaks the immersive spell, suggesting a lack of close narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "tell" over "show" during the climax, summarizing the "entangled memories" rather than fully immersing the reader in the sensory experience. The shift from clinical detachment to psychic receptivity jars the POV's established filter without sufficient transitional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent meditative tone appropriate for a chaplain. However, the distinct repetition of unique phrasing ("aptly deliberate" and "vibrant hush") suggests a lapse in distance control and editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the "machine-poet" persona well. The perspective is stable, merging mechanical limitations with expansive perception. The "irreverent awe" is captured in the rhythm, though the irreverence is sometimes stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable melancholic register ("particular silence," "digital residue"). The point of view remains stable, though the reliance on the "brightly attentive" tag to explain Maren's insights flattens the distinctiveness of her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly interpreting Mira's perceptions and explaining the deeper meaning of events immediately after they occur. While the tone is consistent, the "tell-heavy" approach creates distance and reduces emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is generally controlled but marred by usage errors ("an euthanasia") that damage credibility. The reflective distance is consistent but occasionally muffles the raw impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.3)
    While the lyrical tone is generally consistent, the text suffers from severe artifacting (the Chinese character "她" appearing in paragraph 5) and a hyphenation error ("rediscover-ed"). Additionally, the register break at the climax—where a vineyard worker thinks in philosophy jargon—shatters POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, polished, and suitably mythic, maintaining a controlled distance that suits the "lonely sentinel" archetype. The tone effectively supports the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, constantly interpreting events for the reader rather than allowing them to unfold. Tense consistency slips ("She press the edges") and the intrusion of foreign characters undermine the stability of the POV. The "earnest whimsy" tone is consistent but often slides into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the scholarly protagonist well. However, the narrative distance sometimes feels too filtered ("Elias had noticed," "Elias had sensed"), keeping the reader at arm's length during key observations. The tone is cohesive but risks becoming monotonic.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly suited to the magical realism genre. The tone maintains a consistent "junkyard prophet" register.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistently controlled, maintaining a rhythmic, meditative tone that suits the "sage" persona. While it occasionally borders on preciousness, the narrative distance is stable and the perception is distinctly filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, suiting the meditative nature of the protagonist. The shift from the clinical news to the musical interaction is handled with a steady narrative distance. At times, the prose draws attention to itself ("hymning the mundane"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct and stabilized by the character’s profession.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent with the genre, but it relies on an observational distance that mutes emotional impact. The narrative control is competent, avoiding head-hopping, but lacks a distinct textural signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and confident, matching Elara’s "shrewdly innocent" perspective. The prose rhythm supports the reflective mood without dragging. Narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to Elara’s perception while acknowledging the wider world of the Ministry and fae court.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone but leans heavily on "telling" ("Elira understood immediately," "She recognized something"). This distance prevents deep immersion in the character's immediate experience. The prose occasionally drifts into register mismatches, such as the modern-sounding "sustainable luminescence."

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and slightly melancholic tone throughout. However, the register occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("honeyed hush," "thrum of nothing and everything"), which distances the reader slightly from the raw emotional reality of the confession.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("perpetual damp embrace"). The mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("whisper of closing pages," "feral nexus") disrupts the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled, with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the surreal mode perfectly. Narrative distance is controlled, maintaining close focus on Mira's internal landscape without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from excessive filtering, where emotions are analyzed ("nostalgia of rain," "particular nostalgia") rather than felt. The narration distances the reader from the immediate experience by wrapping the moment in retrospective interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the contemplative mood of the piece. It leans slightly into academic register ("liminal auditory space") but maintains a consistent perceptual signature that aligns with the protagonist’s intellectual approach.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, successfully maintaining a high-lyric mode throughout.

The meditative distance is well-controlled but contributes to the static feel.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy reliance on simile constructions ("like whispered confessions," "like water," "like pages," "like a breath"), creating a filtered, overly "writerly" distance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like quality. However, the POV occasionally slips into expository definition to justify prompt phrases ("Sidereal patience was not merely a concept...").

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, though it occasionally feels heavy-handed with its metaphors. The narrative distance is stable, but the tendency to explain Elara's emotions ("fiercely meditative focus") rather than showing them through behavior creates a slight filter between character and reader.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching the "searing reverie" tone. There is a strong perceptual signature in how Marcus views the world through mechanics and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative voice is shattered by the intrusion of the drafting note, which exposes the artificiality of the text. Prior to the break, the voice is consistent but distant; however, the failure to maintain the fourth wall makes the point of view incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, lofty register that creates a barrier to intimacy. The tone relies heavily on "purple" phrasing ("cosmic accident," "accumulated expectations of every seer") that feels performative rather than grounded in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent—academic, resigned, and precise—fitting the "scholar in ruins" archetype. However, the reliance on diagnostic phrasing ("rational rebellion," "miracles of omission") creates a distance that feels more like a manifesto than an intimate experience. The voice is distinct but lacks dynamic range under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "autumn silence" tone well. However, it occasionally drifts into a distant, "wisdom-dispensing" register that keeps the reader at arm's length, prioritizing philosophical summary over immediate sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully conveys the protagonist's unique perception, though it occasionally strays into melodramatic territory ("cathedral of decay," "worlds exploded"). Distance is well-maintained, but the tone sometimes prioritizes poetic effect over immediate, grounded emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, but the dialogue creates a jarring dissonance, particularly with the child character who speaks in fully articulated philosophical abstracta. This lack of distinct, grounded voice for the secondary character flattens the scene and highlights the artificiality of the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical voice is generally controlled and effective, though prompt-inserted phrases like "creeping normality noticer" disrupt the rhythm. The narration maintains a consistent psychic distance, filtering the world clearly through Mira's hyper-attentive bias.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like tone appropriate for an ancient statue. However, it occasionally slips into abstract, diagnostic phrasing ("structural weakness in his own rigid definition of self") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a detached, analytical tone that suits the protagonist. The mandatory phrase "balancedly daring" is integrated awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm, but the overall POV control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a scholarly, slightly detached register that fits the protagonist's persona. However, the psychic distance is quite high, often summarizing Dr. Vance's worldview ("The historian in her understood...") rather than immersing the reader in her immediate experience. This filter creates a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, melancholic, and controlled, fitting the "scripture of absence" persona well. However, it occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction where simpler observation would be more potent, distancing the reader from the immediate physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice aims for a meditative, scholarly tone but is severely undermined by jarring text artifacts that break the reader's trust. While the perspective is consistent, the lack of polish in key sentences disrupts the "tranquil" authority the voice attempts to establish.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it leans into abstract lyrical assertions that distance the reader from immediate experience. The narrative control is stable, but the reliance on labels ("frequency of belonging") reduces intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction. The POV stays firmly with Vera, effectively conveying her disorientation, though the emotional distance keeps the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from "purple" tendencies that create distance. The reliance on abstract nouns ("unspoken language," "tremblings") prevents deep psychic access to the protagonist's immediate experience.

    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a poetic and elevated register suited to the cartomancer persona. The focus remains tight on the protagonist's interiority, successfully blending the magical with the personal without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone, but suffers from emotional ventriloquism where the narrator dictates the character's precise complex feelings. The "monks, fishermen, child" list feels like a standard rhetorical scaffold rather than specific memory.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, relying on filter verbs like "seemed" and "wondered" that buffer the reader from immediate experience. The tone remains consistent, though it leans into a slightly generic "prompt-response" register.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, dignified academic tone appropriate for the protagonist. However, the psychic distance is often too great, filtering the action through observation ("Varn saw," "Varn understood") rather than immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is polished and lyrical, suiting the atmospheric intent. However, reliance on filter verbs ("Mira found herself," "Mira began to understand") distances the reader from the immediate experience, and the summary of key conversational beats dilutes the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a polished, melancholic register that suits the protagonist's mindset. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally pulls back for summary judgments ("series of strategic choices") that filter the immediate experience. The shift from the station's reality to the arbor's surrealism is handled with a smooth, confident tonal bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like tone that suits the material. The POV is stable but occasionally over-explains emotional states ("Mira understood that she might be the last chance") instead of trusting the dramatized action to convey the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical register, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The perspective remains firmly with Marek, but the "writerly" filter creates a barrier to intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature: “preprocess reality,” “elegant violence,” “light curves.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into shorter units at the moment of release, mirroring dust dispersion. No head-hopping; free indirect discourse is clean. The almost-lyric cadence risks one repetitive anaphora (“she had… she had…”) but redeems it by pattern payoff in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s artisan perception: light, flow, fracture. Syntax lengthens and contracts with temperature imagery; no head-hop. Diction stays within glass-worker lexicon (“molten glass,” “inner fire”). Minor cadence repetition in “frost patterns told her things” / “patterns in the morning frost” but not enough to dull voice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice stays stable, tactile, frost-attuned; syntax lengthens for rhapsodic catalog, then compresses into the final short beats. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature (heat as score, frost as notation) remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter: “lights of distant towns where abundance was merely rationed” carries her exact resentment. Rhythm swells with longer cadence at bell ring, then contracts to quiet shuffle, mirroring breath of crowd. Free-indirect slips cleanly into elder Mariem’s recognition without head-hop. No dialogue on page, so exemption applies; narrative voice alone carries subtext. Slight 0.1 deduction for one generic phrase—“impossible to ignore”—that momentarily flattens idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains clean distance; perceptual signature is painterly-light: “twilight settled like a held breath,” “fireflies rose like the thoughts of earth.” Syntax lengthens then compresses with Mei’s breathing, mirroring uptake/release. No dialogue, so no register clash. Filter verbs are few and motivated (“she understood then”). Occasional lyric loft (“liquid pearl”) stays within an artist’s plausible lexicon; rhythmic control is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains a botanical, slightly arcane diction true to Elara’s profession. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long horticultural cadences contract to the staccato of “She began to draw.” No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent. The halo’s “hum” and the vines “leaning” are poetically credible within the taught hyperbolic reality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person floats close to Mira’s sinewy attention: “clinking softly,” “catechism of survivors.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with her stealth—long sentence for approach, clipped fragments for descent. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on perceptual signature and metaphoric economy; the phrase “green scent of dormant potential” stays within her botanist-poet idiom. No head-hop or register drift; rhythmic control heightens pressure without purple spill.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mira’s perceptual signature: flower code, light viscosity, destiny as audible whisper. Syntax lengthens and softens under golden-hour sentiment, then compresses at the pour—“liquid silver” snapped by train hiss. No head-hop; man’s interior is inferred only through visible relief. Voice modulates with scene temperature without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person free-indirect stays snug to the glassblower’s craftsman lexicon—“gather of amber glass,” “hungry flames”—with rhythmic modulation that accelerates during furnace work and eases during thaw contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Free-indirect texture (“irony was not lost on her”) stays within Maya’s stunt-performer perceptual orbit. Syntax lengthens under reflection, fragments under shelf-pressure, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue until Daniel’s single line—its honeyed condescension carries subtext of ownership. No head-hop; distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains a consistent archaic, tidal cadence; diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) is oracle-colored, not author-intrusive. Compression (“she had walked… carrying only…”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; psychic distance narrows from panoramic ridge to the grit of gold leaf under fingernail, mirroring her focus.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person hover stays tight to robot perception; diction (“manipulator appendages,” “obsolete concept”) feels machine-native.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: glassy surfaces, light refractions, held breath. Syntax lengthens in reflection, shortens at hand-touch. No dialogue; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bias—sap stains, soil acidity, marble web—creating a distinct horticultural idiom. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ritual polishing, clipped fragments for investor summary. No dialogue, so voice carries all tonal weight and succeeds. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory verbs root us in her joints and pocket weight.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kira’s tactile, engineering perception; diction favors tool verbs—“adjusted her wrench belt,” “gripped the lever”—creating a rhythmic, metallic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person keeps psychic distance tight to Elena; perceptual signature privileges sonic and tactile detail over visual clutter. Syntax lengthens during discovery, compresses at the climb-out, mirroring emotional crest and release. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she understood”). The slight register lift in “instrument of its revelation” is the only hairline slip under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature: copper mouth, branching frost-rivers, “station’s steel bones.” Syntax compresses under fever-aftershock—fragments like “Her mouth tasted like copper and regret”—then lengthens as certainty re-anchors. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Distinct rhythmic control: fever-fragments vs. steady forecast diction mirrors her swing from doubt to operational poise.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature—measured, cataloguing, quietly desperate—persists under pressure. Syntax lengthens during the drowsy shift, then fractures at the climax, mirroring altered consciousness. No head-hopping; diction stays within urb-ex lexicon. One clause drifts toward academic (“liminal quality of the moment”) but recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, clause-layered syntax that mirrors the keeper’s drifting attention (“across the drift of untold seasons”).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate carries a warm, melodic cadence that modulates into spare, breath-synced syntax during totality. Perceptual signature—sound-as-tactile, light-as-breath—stays character-locked. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt the familiar ache”) and paid off in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is scholar-tactile—“language of ash,” “brass tools,” “bronze quiet.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens into a single hopeful clause at exit, mirroring mood. No register drift or filler filters. Voice-driven elisions (“the silence of the post-dream world pressed”) are taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person free-indirect voice carries Elias’s cryptic precision: verbs like “orchestrated,” “transposing,” and “channels” echo spy jargon without slipping into pastiche. Rhythm modulates between long accumulative sentences and clipped fragments, mirroring the sweep-and-pause of the lighthouse beam. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited adheres strictly to Matthias’s scholastic sensorium; syntax lengthens and compresses with the looping chant, producing a textured, priest-rhythm that never leaks into editorial exposition. Distinctive perceptual signature––“the color of the inside of a wound just beginning to heal”––carries through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Elira’s synesthetic perception: “smell of ginger and snow becoming the same thing.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional intensity; the final sentence dissolves into light without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. The perceptual signature—mathematical yet olfactory, crystalline yet culinary—feels singular and sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric compression is taught in the opening clause ("between the drop and the ripple") and sustained; patterned elision ("periodically eternal") stays legible. Perceptual signature is consistent—runes shift "when she wasn't looking," a POV-specific noticing. Rhythm modulates with stress: long sentences for suspension, clipped final line for agency. No head-hopping; voice remains singular and urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person omniscient stays anchored in Elena’s perceptual filter—meteorological metaphors, sensorial hierarchy of stone warmth, jasmine scent. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Syntax mirrors her cartographic mind: long, clause-rich sentences that breathe during reflection then tighten into two-word decision beats (“She would not hide.”). Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is academic diction outside her lexicon (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric-supple, syntax lengthens and contracts with UV exposure cadence. Diction stays within botanic-POV lexicon; “aromatically cautious,” “molecular memories” feel idiosyncratic yet precise. No dialogue, hence no register drift. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are sparse and earned; perceptual signature holds. Final paragraph modulates to elegiac rhythm without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder, adopting her poet’s synesthesia (“starlight… like something alive”) without ever breaking filter. Syntax lengthens under contemplative pressure, then snaps into the short final clause “by beginning the pattern again,” mirroring the spiral. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature alone—and succeeds. The only minor slip is one adjective pile-up (“rough and patient warmth”) that momentarily softens the verb drive.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited adheres to Marina’s sensory field; idiom (“echo-harbor violinist,” “stubborn beauty”) feels musician-specific, not borrowed. Syntax lengthens with bow strokes and contracts at peak silence; no POV leakage. Clean conventional mechanics except one purposeful fragment (“Nothing answered her.”) that teaches the chronic hush.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual signature: static electricity as “tiny electric admissions,” grief that “rearranges the furniture of her interior world.” Syntax mirrors craft precision—long accumulative phrases that tighten into the final short sentence. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Psychic distance stable; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s maritime perceptual signature—“reading the tides,” “freight weights against moon phases.” Rhythm modulates from languid stroll to hushed library cadence. One filter-verb cluster (“found herself walking,” “found a single page”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Yara’s perceptual filter: “hollow promise” of reed, “geometric shadows” that hurt somehow. Syntax mirrors her spiral mindset—long, winding sentences that coil back to the self. Diction stays within fen-reader lexicon; no corporate register drift. Moment of recognition in the arbor uses short, blade-like fragments that compress under stress, then release into the longer climb-out sentence—rhythmic control that serves the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays close to Sera’s perceptual filters—pale moth, water stutter, pendant chill—without POV drift; syntax lengthens during calm reflection, tightens into clipped clauses when cadence falters, creating rhythmic fidelity to the acoustic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, filtering every noun through her tactile lexicon—“infrastructure’s language,” “magnetic ribbon.” Syntax lengthens during discovery then compresses at the smile, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within custodial register. One head-hop attempt—“a student who has been struggling finds the answer”—is brief, forgivable, and serves the conceptual reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person prose carries Vera’s perceptual signature: Latin-laced diction, clause structures that mimic vine branching. Rhythm slackens slightly during reflective paragraphs but resurges in the trellis paragraph’s shorter bursts. No dialogue means voice evaluation focuses on free-indirect texture, which stays botanist-detached even at emotional crest—exactly her shield.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains synesthetic diction (“world had begun to speak in colors”) without head-hop. Rhythm contracts under fatigue—long vowels, caesuras—then sharpens through the telescope’s “crystalline focus.” The stranger’s diction is spare, a counter-rhythm that foregrounds Mira’s lyric register. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature: “salt crystals still clung,” “fingers moved automatically,” syntax mirroring cataloguer habit. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences collapse into the tight final clause: “feeling its weight and purpose align at last.” No dialogue, so voice contamination is avoided. Filter verbs (“he saw,” “he felt”) are minimal and character-apt; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV remains tight to Aria’s perceptual filter: surgical noticing, poetic leaps, synesthetic star-smudges. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under stress (“trembling certainty”). Syntax mirrors her mind—long analytical clauses cut by imagistic fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains precise, scientist’s diction: “instruments calibrated for precision,” “symbols arranged in patterns that seemed both chaotic and deliberate.” Rhythm accelerates during transcription, sentences shorten, then widen into lyrical final paragraph. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays rooted in her tool-mediated gaze. Filter verbs serve voice when framing data, never dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance, filtered through Elian’s ancient perceptual signature—light fractured into spectra, magnetic lines as supplicants. Diction (“escondite,” “spatial mutiny”) remains within a quasi-timeless immortal lexicon, justified by seven-millennia scope. Rhythm swells from languid opening to pulsing storm, mirroring rising urgency without monotony. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. The voice is singular, coherent, and charged at closure.

    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s perceptual signature—ledger metaphors, mortician precision, smell of formaldehyde. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, then compresses when the door opens, mirroring her pulse. No dialogue is required; the one spoken name (“Darius”) arrives as reported fact, preserving hush. Free indirect style is clean: “the ink seemed to understand” reads as her projection, not magical omniscience.

Voice modulates from mournful to quietly resolved without breaking texture.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV remains tight internal focalization; no head-hop. Voice is erudite yet melancholy—“theatrical trappings of the supernatural” is exactly the phrase this mind would reach for. Rhythm modulates: longer Latinate clauses in calm reflection collapse into staccato fragments under cello-induced visions. No filter-verb clusters; perception is concrete (“dust motes drifted…dead eyes”). Dialogue is absent by design; interior monologue carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skewed to cartographer-like noticing (“mapping the geography of displacement”). Prose rhythm mirrors Mira’s orderly intuition—paratactic catalogues of symbols, then elongated clause as hope swells. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided.

The voice never explains its own metaphors, trusting the reader to feel vibration as meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction—“robes sweeping across marble,” “breath of centuries”—is elevated yet consistent with mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person stays welded to Marcus’s sensory register (“copperlight repose… fever breaking into sweat”); rhythmic control heightens under pressure, no head-hop, and patterned elision (“hovered now at the threshold… in that other sense”) is taught early and paid off at threshold crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elira’s drug-blurred sensorium: sounds arrive “from distant shores,” light is “strained.” Perceptual signature is translator-precision—she notices script loops, ink color, wrist-edge pressure—never generic hospital haze. Syntax elongates then fragments under anesthesia, mirroring the blurring world. No dialogue from Fatima, a deliberate choice that keeps the child’s interior off-limits, forcing Elira’s voice to carry both griefs.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lingers inside Mira’s perceptual filter—light as breath on glass, pigment ghosts sleeping—syntax lengthens with projection, shortens under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Mira’s perceptual hierarchy: she notices what a cartographer of echoes would—footstep-worn stones, chemical behavior of negatives, ivy's hush. Syntax lengthens and softens during discovery, then compresses into short declaratives as light fails, mirroring her shift from excavation to acceptance. No head-hopping or register drift; the single moment of elevated diction—“conceptual repricing”—is contained within Ashworth’s diary voice, not the narrator’s.

No head-hopping; Duchess Sera’s softening is observed externally. Diction remains within Maren’s plausible lexicon (“operatively gentle” is her own professional idiom). One microscopic slip: “celestial dance” risks poetic cliché, but the immediate re-anchoring to Jupiter and Venus saves specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is steel-spined, lyric-cold: “the calculus in her eyes” condenses worldview into a noun phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric compression is taught early (“precisely playful geometries”) and held; perceptual signature is consistent—dream-cartography, pulse-listening, copper scent.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyrical third-person stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—selective attention to glass, frost, orchard stones—and rhythmic sentence stacks mimic breath pattern; no head-hopping or register drift.

Compression (“carefully resourceful methods”) occasionally over-explains instead of embodying thought. No dialogue appears, so voice consistency rests on narrative texture, which holds.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s perceptual filter—smells, weights, chemical ratios. Rhythm mimics her counting chant: long lyrical sentences build, then fracture into clause bursts at ignition.

    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Mira’s—geometry of concrete, language of sealed doors. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“threaded with the susurrus of invisible growth”) then compresses at gravity’s return, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: Maren notices “the exact frequency of his distress, the way it pitched upward at the end like a question without an answer.” Syntax mirrors her logic-lyric mind—long accumulative clauses that breathe at the harmonic comma.
