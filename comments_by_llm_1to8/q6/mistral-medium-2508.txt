  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV narration is stable; perceptual signature (scientific precision meeting lyric metaphor: "neutron star's crust," "prismatic ghosts") is consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from embodied action (kneeling, sprinkling dust) to reflection. One recurring friction: elevated diction occasionally strains against the immediacy of scene—"preprocessed reality in ways he was only beginning to grasp," "the honest work of watching things fall apart"—reading more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The final paragraph's syntax ("Like butterfly wings. Like the first breath.") risks precious patterning but remains voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV with stable third-person-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye, light/fracture metaphors). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent. However, several lines compress into lyric abstraction under pressure ("the pauses were where the truth lived") rather than maintaining concrete sensory texture. Free indirect style is mostly clean. No dialogue present. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats, though occasional elevated register ("drifting resonance") slightly exceeds the established lexical range in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: grief filters observation ("cathedral of sound," "tomb of winterglass"). However, figurative density becomes effortful in peak beats ("raw, unshaken marvel," "the music of things breaking and reforming"), and the narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("As-you-know" philosophizing from the mentor). Internal voice remains coherent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful, with a controlled lyric register ("like the breath of a sleeping beast," "a trapped scream") that remains consistent under pressure. POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptions are filtered through his undertaker's pragmatism and quiet stubbornness. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climb. The prose modulates between reflective passages and active beats without head-hopping. No dialogue present; interiority carries the narrative cleanly. Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon—practical, poetic only in imagery, never academic. Minor compression at peak stress (lighthouse climb) maintains internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds clean focalization on Elias with no head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature (calloused hands, water wearing stone, bell clutched like a dying man's breath) is character-specific and consistent. Diction matches the exile community's context (no register mismatches), and compression in the final third (arbor burning → dawn stand → seasonal epilogue) accelerates purposefully. Minor: "amplification of survival" and "quiet amplification of a people" edge toward thematic echo, and some gestures (tugged sleeve, pressed note) are competent but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable focal distance; Elias's perceptual signature (warm brass, fog shapes, hitching breath) is consistent. The spectral woman's direct-address dialogue ("You kept me in your ribs") shifts register toward lyric incantation, acceptable within the twilight-bloom tone but briefly flattening Elias's active perception. The closing paragraph's syntactic rhythm ("deepened… no longer felt… was a threshold… was the keeper") stacks verb patterns in a way that reads template-like rather than voice-driven under peak emotion. Diction remains elevated throughout ("wreathed," "lucid fog," "reclaimed sparks"), fitting the accumulative mode, but lacks modulation when pressure should tighten or breathe. Dialogue is minimal and serves motif over interpersonal friction; no second living character tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's perceptual signature is consistent—professional maze-designer idiom blended with elevated poetic register. Focalization remains stable in close third, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during high-pressure beats (climb, confrontation, throw). However, diction uniformly operates in a high register throughout ("quaking reverie," "retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") that doesn't shift under peak stress, and the woman's dialogue shares Liora's elevated syntax rather than creating voice distinction. Filter verbs ("realized," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; perceptual signature is consistent (tracing keys, whispering mantras, sensing wind). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with compression ("the wall was already forgotten") supporting closure rhythm. Two frictions: the phrase "grace so staggering it looked like surrender until the moment it won" shifts into essayistic register at the climax, and the narrator's confident assertion that "no one would call it a miracle" claims off-page consensus. These slips prevent 8+ entry but do not obscure focalization or the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's synesthetic perception (violet hum, indigo bruise, colors of sound). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the forge scene. Diction is elevated and poetic, fitting the lyric-accumulative mode, though occasional register slips ("the cells in his bones divided") feel more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is strong (hearing aids designer who hears colors), but a few lines ("frequency just below grief") edge toward abstraction under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("he thought," "he didn't try to name") are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register ("shadow with a gilded edge," "destiny's door"). The voice modulates appropriately under pressure, tightening during the confrontation. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the stationmaster's lines carry threat and subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices light, arrangement, and temporal cues. Minor overwriting in places ("the sky's last defiant breath") slightly inflates diction, and some filter verbs ("she'd never expected it to *answer*") dull immediacy when directness would sharpen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable single-focalization; perceptual signature is glasswork-specific ("coaxing it to remember its fire," "thin enough to shatter with a whisper"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful repetition ("First, you...") used as craft instruction. The narration to "ghosts" and "no one" reflects workshop habit without head-hopping. However, several phrases approach elevated register without full embodiment: "sanctuary for the curious" tastes like rust but never fully bites; "controlled collapse" and "crucible" are conceptually apt yet slightly abstract for peak pressure moments. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose compresses smoothly across two locations with one clean break.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Lena's perceptual signature (stunt-diagram thinking, translating cast marks into "pressure here, pivot there") provides character-specific filtering. However, the narration slips into over-articulated interiority during peak beats: "The betrayal coiled tighter" and "vulnerability wasn't weakness" read as meta-commentary. Dialogue with the girl is functional but lacks subtext or tension; her lines deliver information without pursuit or evasion. Voice modulates under pressure but relies on familiar intensity markers (sharp laugh, rough voice).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register: "breath curling into the frigid air," "the ambered hush." Perceptual signature is oracle-specific (recording silences, tracing gold leaf), and diction remains elevated but controlled. However, at peak moments the prose slips into diagnostic abstraction ("the way silence could be a wound or a cradle") and the voice does not modulate under pressure—every beat carries the same contemplative cadence. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable but lacks urgency-driven compression.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on X-7 with consistent mechanical idiom ("optical sensors," "servos," "audio receptors"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"amalgamated with the twilight," "something akin to reverence"—that clashes with the established robotic lexicon during peak beats. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the void moment, though the perceptual signature remains generic (hum, zoom, process) rather than character-particular. The final "exhaled—a sound like steam" lands well, but overall voice lacks the rhythmic control and specificity to enter high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices light, texture, silence as presence. Diction is consistent and lyric: "the kind of quiet that wasn't empty but full—of echoes, of possibilities." Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You said you'd be there" / "That's—" / "Us"). The couple's voices are under-differentiated but their scant lines serve subtext. Rhythm modulates appropriately (short fragments at the couple's exchange, longer lyric sentences in reflection). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Elision (Lena's backstory, the couple's unseen departure) is purposeful and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—vine dresser's attention to broken things, garden's whispers, the elders' dry voices—and diction matches her withered, patient stance. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven: "Your section is deficient" / "Look... Some things aren't meant to be measured." The prose carries a distinct lyric texture in word choice ("mended deception," "blooming withering," "shattered promises") though some phrases ("ready to learn the names of the vines instead of their weights") edge toward summary register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening around the polishing ritual and widening for the elders' transformation, with no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through Elias's technical expertise and obsessive focus. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "mechanically warm" hands, the way he tunes the lever "the way you'd tune an instrument," and his awareness of the station's clocks slowing. The prose texture reflects his mindset—precise, methodical, with poetic compression during high-pressure beats. Brief dialogue with the AI is clean and goal-driven, carrying subtext (the AI's "icy but not unkind" voice, the sigh of bureaucratic resignation). Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (musician's lens: "strings groaning in sympathy," "bow drawing a single, sustained note"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the operatic setting, though some phrases approach purple excess: "water lapped like a slow, patient tongue," "liminal place, a throat holding a scream." Purposeful compression and repetition of "in-between spaces" teach a pattern that pays off at closure. No dialogue is present, so naturalism and subtext bullets are N/A. The final paragraphs maintain rhythmic control without collapsing into summary. Minor register slip: "lately inspired—not by music, but by the way the water damaged" shifts from lyric to explanatory mid-beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance narrows during peak reflection ("truths were heavy things to swallow") and widens for the closing image without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Liora notices barometric pressure, raven behavior, needle stutters—calibrated to her oracle role. Diction occasionally drifts high ("perilously so," "capsize the world") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: "The wind carried her name away before she could hear it. Or perhaps she had never said it at all" leans slightly meta without clear POV anchor, though the effect supports thematic ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias appraises objects as a scavenger ("souvenirs of a dozen other ruins"), and diction remains character-bound ("drowsy, alert second"). No head-hopping. The psychic's radio voice provides external contrast without contaminating internal texture. Rhythm modulates appropriately from the opening's languid "exhaled damp" to the terse closure moves. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a consistent, incantatory rhythm that suits the hermetic mood. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace"). However, syntactic patterns become repetitive—short declarative followed by metaphoric expansion—and several lines loop conceptually: "watching, unjudging" and "witness, a fold, a breath" recycle the same image without propulsion. No head-hopping, but voice lacks the perceptual particularity that would distinguish this keeper from any mystic-hermit archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("tuning fork in his pocket," "metronome stuck on *allegro*") supports character and pressure. POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Trust me," "Listen," "For the next one who needs to hear the ridge sing"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slips: "ordinary magic, his mother would've called it" leans expository, and the final reflection ("he decided") tells where showing would sharpen. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and intimate, filtering all perception through Elias's archival sensibility ("his sensitively perceptive fingers," "exhaled through his nose, the sound like a rusted hinge"). Diction is consistent—elevated but tactile, no register drift. The prose carries a distinct rhythmic signature: long, layered sentences during contemplation, shorter beats at the axis pivot. Free indirect style is clean. Minor: "sensitively perceptive" edges toward filter-stack phrasing, though the sensory specificity that follows recovers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Chen notices ink, smoke, rhythm, lens) and selective. Diction stays within Chen's register (calm, measured, occasionally wry). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and distinct (daughter's urgency vs. Chen's directive calm). Distance modulates purposefully between close (Chen's thoughts on fate) and wider (train departure as establishing shot). Two minor slips: "familiar enigma" tone occasionally tips toward authorial performance ("the way you rewrote a fortune so the next person...would finally understand") and one phrase ("transposing life into a new key, the way you retuned a radio") leans slightly elevated for the POV's internal voice under departure pressure, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the priest until his dissolution, then shifts cleanly to the novice at a section break—acceptable under Multi-POV Track C. Perceptual signature: the priest's lens filters the chamber through metaphor (silence as decoration, color as thought), but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("muffled clarity," "unwritten symbols") without grounding in his sensory particulars. Dialogue between priest and entity carries subtext ("mistake decoration for surrender") but the entity's voice ("chorus of borrowed syllables") remains generic menace. The novice's brief segment lacks distinct interior texture; their actions mirror the priest's without voice differentiation. No mid-paragraph head-hopping, but the two POVs read as interchangeable philosophical observers rather than distinct minds.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Li Wei filters the world through musician's metaphors (metronome, treble clef, overture, scale) and temporal dislocation (horizon as cracked mirror refracting past hours). Diction is controlled and lyric, rhythm modulates with pressure (short breaths at the shell moment, longer syntactic swells during memory). However, some figurative language stacks densely in middle paragraphs without always advancing pressure, and a few lines ("the dawn hung like a breath held before the first, true note") verge on self-conscious poeticism that slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly individuated: "gravity itself hesitated," "rain's afterglow bleeding into something thicker, something hungry" reads as purposeful lyricism rather than Elias's specific idiom. Diction remains consistent and elevated throughout, with purposeful compression ("sideways, into a version of itself"). The shadow-self's single line of dialogue ("You always stop here") advances plot and carries subtext. Psychic distance modulates intentionally at the collision and closure beats, supporting the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering sensory detail through Elias's tactile bias (grooves "like Braille," vibrations "like whispers"). Psychic distance is consistent, though occasional phrases—"the kind of quiet that enthralled"—drift slightly toward narrator commentary rather than strict character perception. The drum maker's sign language and the lack of auditory cues maintain voice coherence. Diction is controlled and particular ("gnarled roots," "filament of hush"), though "audibly muted" in the phonograph passage borders on oxymoron without full clarity. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Perceptual signature is strong in the emphasis on pressure and texture, though a few moments of elevated lyricism ("ghost of rhythms not yet born") slightly exceed what the focalizer would articulate mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices via professional instruments (barometric pressure, compass needles) and ornithological cues (pigeons' uneven coos). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("a breath held between day and night," "the air tasting of ozone and old pennies"). One register slip: "credibly curious nature" reads slightly clinical mid-scene, though it could be intentional free indirect. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening in the message-reading beat and widening for reflective passages. The prose maintains a measured, observational rhythm that mirrors Elias's discipline, though under peak pressure (the door creak) the syntax does not compress to reflect heightened stress.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, filtering through the poet's tactile and meditative lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices texture, hums, shadow arcs, frayed ends. Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("ethically playful," "currency," "weave of every choice"). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—short declaratives ("He never did.") punctuate longer reflective spirals. One minor slip: "their light bending just slightly, as if smiling" anthropomorphizes from the narrator's remove rather than the poet's direct perception, a brief filter leak that does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (acoustically perceptive ears, calloused fingers, attention to sound and silence) is character-specific. Diction remains controlled and purposeful, with vocabulary calibrated to Liora's artisan sensibility. Dialogue is sparse and natural ("You're real." / "So are you."), carrying subtext and advancing plot. Minor slip: "the chronic hush, at last, learned to sing" edges toward overt poeticism, though it remains within the lyric register established early. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable through Liora's perceptual filter; her professional vocabulary (calibrated cuffs, static charge mapping) and the way she reads emotional truth through scent and electricity create a distinct signature. The prose modulates effectively from clinical assessment ("professionally thorough") to sensory immersion ("fragrance unfolding like a story told backward") to the charged final image. Brief dialogue serves purpose ("You want the truth?" / "Is this—?" / "Yes") without over-explaining. Some filter verbs ("let the static guide her," "watching the last of the light") appear but remain voice-consistent. The lyric compression in later paragraphs (short declaratives, repetition of "The petals always knew") fits the accumulative mode and Liora's distanced professionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds Elias's focalization without leakage; his observations filter through a broker's calculus ("spotting undervalued goods—and people"). Dialogue carries distinct idiom: his grin and proposition voice versus her shield-like wariness ("You're a broker, not a saint"). Filter verbs ("he'd watched," "he decided") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to the reflective final beat. One slip: the librarian's instant recognition of the locket's provenance ("her mother's initial, she whispered") feels slightly over-articulated for natural speech under stress, though not egregious.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-literary register with purposeful compression ("a wound in the earth where the air hummed") and Reed's perceptual signature (sculptor's attention to material, hollow stems, starlight). Distance is stable third-limited. Two dialogue exchanges are spare and functional, though Syl's lines lack distinct idiom beyond brevity. Minor register drift: "grafted herself onto the village" and "current, something that moved through you when you reached out" read slightly elevated for the tactile sculptor's established texture, and the final reflection flirts with thematic summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "interrupted cadence," "a pulse of light throbbed like a trapped heartbeat," "thin as paper," "teeth sharp as a clock's hands." Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Elspeth; no head-hopping. The boy's dialogue ("Clever girl") feels slightly generic, but his cryptic idiom is consistent. Under peak stress (jar thrown, thread pulled), syntax compresses appropriately without losing coherence. Free indirect blends description and perception cleanly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled psychic distance and a consistent elevated register ("syncopated," "phosphorescent," "juror"). Perceptual signature is strong: the conjurer filters sensory data through mathematical metaphors ("each fracture a variable"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction (e.g., repeated "almost") are taught and paid off at closure. Minor dip: the heightened lexicon occasionally drifts from embodied perception ("Morse code of loss") into authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Elias with clean distance; no head-hopping. His perceptual signature is methodical and texture-focused ("calloused fingers tracing the cold metal," "the hum of the city's power grid"). The woman's brief dialogue ("Hello?" / "You were there") feels natural and goal-driven. Elias's single line ("There are more") iseconomical and voice-consistent. Syntax modulates under pressure: short beats during the tape drop, longer reflection during backstory. Minor: "raw and bright, like the first spark after a blackout" slightly elevates diction but remains within narrative register.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perception filters through Liora's botanical lens ("serrated edges," "waxy resistance"). Diction remains consistent with her voice—professional observation layered with poetic compression. The dialogue is spare but purposeful: "You're not supposed to do that" and the final "Plant this... And don't tell it how to grow" carry subtext and plot advancement. Minor slips: "letting the wind and rain peel away what no longer served it" and "ritual of transformation" tilt toward elevated register in peak beats, and the phrase "raw and unfamiliar, like a seed splitting open" feels slightly external. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "a dry, wry sound," "the sky itself were too exhausted to weep straight," "or something in between—it didn't matter." Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The amber woman's dialogue ("You're late") fits the mythic register without exposition. Elias's perceptual signature filters setting through painter's eyes (light fractured on water, colors drunk by canvas). Brief compression during the vision sequence is purposeful and legible. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (clairvoyant reading ripples, flicker, cave's song) and diction carries a lyric register ("the sheer *weight* of its silence," "starlight trapped in tar"). The entity's dialogue feels writerly rather than spoken—no character would say "magic isn't in the grand gestures" mid-crisis—and lacks subtext or evasion. Italicized emphasis (*"You didn't see me coming,"* *inhabited*) becomes a tic that flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("she *understood*," "she *saw*") are voice-motivated but cluster in the vision beat without propulsion. Psychic distance remains stable, and the closing rhythm ("She didn't look back. She didn't need to. The world was enough.") delivers controlled cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with perceptual signature (ocean-spray archivist noticing salt-crusted edges, syncopated heartbeat metaphors). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure ("His hands trembled—not from cold"). The child's brief dialogue ("Blow when you're ready") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor register drift occurs in "reactively visionary" and "navigated...an absence shaped by the space around it," which elevate beyond the established texture during peak beats. Psychic distance shifts intentionally when the narrative pulls back to the cityscape at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction exhibits mild overwriting: "fortress of unspoken truths," "wounds bleeding through," "phantom train rolled on invisible tracks" stack elevated metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff. The sister's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("You were always better at reading maps than me") but her spectral role limits friction. Psychic distance compresses smoothly during the vault encounter. Perceptual signature is present but intermittent: the analytically artistic lens shows in compass-reading but doesn't consistently filter every perception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (astronomer's precision, grief-sharpened attention). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("gas and fire," "off-key while mending nets"). The brother's brief dialogue feels natural and character-specific. However, the prose drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("entangled memories pressing against the walls," "unheard symphony no human ear was meant to hear") that strains the established voice. Brief filter-verb stacks ("she didn't look away," "she didn't need") in the climax slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and poetic, with strong rhythmic control: "geometry gone feral," "hushed thunder of a universe leaning in to hear the punchline." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature reads as an immortal's weary, curious gaze. Minor issue: some elevated diction ("prismatic escondite," "spatial mutiny") risks register drift from Lysander's internal lexicon, though it remains largely voice-motivated. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and pay off at closure. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Voice has texture ("breath reeking of formaldehyde and bad decisions," "the night didn't either") and perceptual bias (she "counts what's missing"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the girl's lines feel slightly generic ("You count what's missing," "Next time, we count together") and lack idiolect. Register holds except for one slip: "consensus reality" scaffolding in "the pot *pulled*" anthropomorphism, which reads acceptable for magical-object agency. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person close with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture: "incandescent restraint," "a held breath," "flower that only bloomed in the dark." Diction is elevated and consistent with the stationer's aesthetic persona. However, the voice occasionally slips into decorative register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered—"the careful alchemy of his hands," "letting the warmth of the rising sun press against his skin" reads writerly rather than lived. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (focus on textures, hums, light) but the syntax is uniform across emotional beats, reducing modulation under pressure. The lamp's hum and Elara's emergence should quicken the prose; instead, the cadence remains steady and ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Daniel's selective attention to texture, rhythm, and fragments reflects his ghost-status consistently. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("labyrinth's maw," "syrupy," "scent of diesel") is specific and voice-driven. Brief dialogue snippets from dockworkers feel natural and purposeful. Minor register wobble in "metaphor: some histories" (overly literary for a man dissolving into the port) but does not disrupt overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinctive: "self-proclaimed myth buster, accidental poet of half-truths," "gloomy cheerfulness was his brand." Psychic distance is controlled, though some phrases ("ephemeral compass," "resonant hum, a retelling") edge toward elevated diction that tests POV modesty. The grandmother's reimagined voice is filtered through Elias's perception, maintaining focalization. Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and the closing parenthetical—"(And if you leaned close enough, you could almost hear the shell singing back.)"—breaks frame slightly but reads as intentional coda rather than head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable first-person-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (brass cuff whirring, paint streaks as bodily markers). Dialogue with Jax is naturalistic and goal-driven, carrying subtext effectively. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts above Elira's established register ("labyrinthine charm," "eternal now") without voice-motivated reason. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought formatting is consistent. The prose reflects Elira's artist's eye through selective, texture-rich detail, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a lyric-inflected distance: "He wanted to outlast them, if only in memory" and "his thumb traced the camera's screen" filter perception through Elias's professional and emotional lens. Diction is purposeful—"ghosts of light," "dawnlit hush," "knife-edge of light"—though the phrase "a quiet so vast it hummed" borders on stock poetic register. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans on repeated syntactic patterns ("He snapped...Then another...And another") that flatten rhythm under pressure, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, tightly bound to Elias's perceptual signature: "vibration through the soles of his boots," "the way the mist curled cooler," "the water told him what the mist obscured." Psychic distance remains close; no head-hopping. Diction stays within his artisan lexicon ("feedback," "seam," "housing," "refraction"). The captain's single line of dialogue is distinct (polished brass voice) and goal-driven (seeking confirmation). Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (crowd, departure), sentence rhythm compresses without losing specificity: "He didn't answer. / He didn't need to." Voice remains character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; Lena's perceptual signature—condensation tracing, ink-stain cuffs, editor's precision—is distinct and consistent. Diction ("quiet catastrophe," "worrying tranquility") is controlled and voice-motivated. The water's voice in the dead tongue avoids head-hopping by remaining external stimulus. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from observational opening to intimate interior at the ice, and the final image holds coherent focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated, precise diction ("gaunt figure," "wild hush," "stubborn faith") remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in the tuner's professional filtering (noting the fork's weight, the resonance felt rather than heard). Rhythm modulates purposefully, accelerating when the archway groans and slowing at the final image. The single line of dialogue ("You're late" / "I know") carries subtext and advances plot without disrupting the narrative texture. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature—sensory detail filtered through diver's attention (corroded metal, salt-violet scent, silt-stirred mosaics)—grounds Liora's focus. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional elevated flourishes ("unspooling," "veins of light") risk register drift during peak pressure. The prose modulates well under stress (short beats at the vial-uncorking), and interiority stays character-bound. No dialogue is present to evaluate, and the POV does not withhold known facts for false suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("rusted needle in the throat of the sea"), elevated diction consistent with Elias's myth-steeped interior. POV remains stable third-limited. Dialogue (whispers, Elias's exchanges) carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor friction: figurative density is high throughout ("knots that shouldn't hold but did, sustaining impossibilities") and occasionally stacks without grounding action, risking ornamentation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms in at lattice touch, pulls back for aftermath). No head-hopping; filter verbs ("pressed," "whispered") fit the register.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora, with brief omniscient tracking of the keeper and Vesper that remains clear at section breaks. Perceptual signature is lyric and gothic ("smoke through a keyhole," "petals crumbling"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("excavation: she clawed her way") that sits uneasily with the embodied ghostly hunger the piece claims. Dialogue is spare and purposeful (keeper's "Again?" and Vesper's "You woke me"); filter verbs ("She knew," "watched") appear but do not stack heavily. The prose maintains atmospheric coherence, though the voice feels more authorial-poetic than character-rooted internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is lyric and controlled with a consistent metaphorical register (weaver/loom/stitch/thread) and purposeful compression ("a man of frayed edges"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, elevated diction ("haunting optimism," "orchid solace" tone) occasionally drifts above the POV's embodied experience, and the final-third prose leans toward authorial assertion ("He understood then: the labyrinth wasn't a maze. It was a loom.") rather than allowing the realization to emerge through image alone. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias's perception throughout. His voice carries labor-specific detail (calloused hands, methodical brushing) and a quiet, determined cadence that modulates under pressure—his laugh at the sapling is "raw and disbelieving," a perfect pitch shift. Psychic distance tightens during the dream and sapling emergence. The prose reflects his mind: patient, observant, warmly curious. One filter-verb cluster in the dream sequence ("when he reached") slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains distinct and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Lena notices grit of chalk, breath fog, the weight of objects. Diction remains within her register ("carefully inventive" as internalized compass, technical yet poetic). No dialogue to evaluate. Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter fragments during the mailing hesitation. The phrase "someone who knew how to move through the world without leaving ripples" reads slightly writerly for the moment but doesn't break voice. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with controlled psychic distance and a distinct lyric register ("bruise against the autumn sky," "flame consumed the words but not their meaning"). Diction is elevated and metaphor-dense, which fits the voice-motivated symbolic texture, but under peak stress (enforcers arriving, dome shattering) the prose maintains the same ornamental cadence rather than compressing or sharpening. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You're the one who listens," "They're coming at dawn"), carrying subtext without naturalism issues. The courier's perceptual signature is absent—she appears, delivers her line, and flees without interior coloring. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe," "as if measuring") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Liora's perceptions with a distinct lyric texture: "the spirits here sang in the spaces between words," "time pretending to be kind." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming in for tactile moments (shard pressed to palm) and pulling back for reflective passages. Diction remains character-specific, blending naturalistic action with poetic compression. However, some metaphors drift toward stock lyricism ("the river between us isn't water but silence") and the narrative voice occasionally slips into writerly performance rather than Liora's immediate consciousness. No dialogue is present to test differentiation. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices texture (bark knots, paper pulse) and spiritual presence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with perceptual signature tied to Lena's translator lens: "unknotting," "decrypting," "negative space." Diction stays within her register ("grafter," "dialect of grief") with purposeful compression ("mortar fire stuttered"). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven; the boy's thin voice and Lena's economy ("I unknot them") distinguish speakers. Minor register slip: "lotus-hearted ache" (from tone requirement) appears nowhere in the text, suggesting prompt divorce. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the cast and photo beats. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("her translator's instinct unknotting") serve voice. No head-hopping; focalization locked to Lena throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"soft with moss like a memory half-forgotten," "the air itself had been thick with the scent of ripening peaches and the buzz of shared laughter." Liora's perceptual signature (artist's eye, focus on light and pigment) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight on her hands and breath when she finds the fragment, then pulling back to witness the crowd's reaction at the climax. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not engaged. A few filter verbs cluster without harm ("made her breath catch," "felt like grief"), and one phrase—"exposed film she'd been developing, the emulsion still wet and sensitive, hungry for impressions"—anthropomorphizes the film in a way that briefly slips register but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and free of head-hopping. Liora's perceptual signature is consistent: she notices texture, light, and vibration through a restorer's lens. The dialogue with the fig-woman and old man is stylized and mystical, which fits the surreal tone but borders on allegorical transparency. The prose rhythm modulates with her escalating disorientation, though some figurative language ("thread," "coiled," "bewitching") stacks densely in the nested-awakening beats without full voice-motivated integration.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority in the greenhouse, external surveillance overhead). Diction is consistent—"candidly cryptic," "warping the soil into syntax"—and voice-motivated phrases like "all sharp edges and misplaced charm" feel character-specific. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext and goal pursuit ("And if they dig it up?" / "Then they'll just think we've got a hell of a green thumb"). Minor register drift appears in abstract phrases ("the one thing they could never confiscate"), but the perceptual signature holds.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent in diction ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy," "acoustics bent sound into something almost holy"), with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the world through song, growth, and warfare. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats without variation, and the ghost's dialogue ("You sing to us," voice described as "rusted") converges in idiom with the poet's narration. POV distance is stable (close third), but the narrative occasionally drifts into omniscient summary ("They said she was trying to wake them") without anchoring the claim in the poet's perception. Purposeful compression (e.g., "The third she ate") works, but some figurative constructions feel strained ("to listen as the shell exhaled, its breath laced with the scent of crushed violets and gunpowder turned to pollen").

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct: diction ("half-remembered dream," "foxglove regret," "gently systematic grace") is elevated yet consistent, matching a caretaker of extinct marvels. Perceptual signature is clear—Liora notices petals, cracks, sounds—filtered through her curatorial lens. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (covering ears, gasping, trembling). Minor slip: "foxglove regret—bitter, poisonous, beautiful" reads slightly authorial in rhythm, though it remains anchored in sensory perception. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate. Narrative certainty matches focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV (third-limited on Elara) is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "breath that tasted of iron and old paper," the archive "smelled of crushed violets." Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close during the singing, distant in the final parenthetical aside). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("gestation," "exuberant," "reclaim") that feels more authorial than Elara's voice under crisis pressure. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("And if, years later...") breaks voice consistency. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood") are used but not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liora's sensory filter. Diction is controlled—"crumbling throat of stone," "blade against the ridges"—and perceptual signature is consistent (engineer's eye for gears, welds, pressure signatures in metal). Distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the letter discovery, pulling back slightly for the elder confrontation. Minor pattern: several sentences begin with "The" or "She," creating mild template cadence in the middle third. Filter verbs ("watched," "understood") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-particular: "ink the color of dried roses," "dust motes swirling in currents he'd learned to read like sheet music." Perceptual signature is musical and tactile throughout. Madame Holloway's dialogue feels natural and advances pressure ("They're the only thing you've let yourself keep"). Minor slips: "Trust the chaos" in flashback reads slightly generic, and the final paragraph's "Some paper trails..." risks thematic summary, though the pen gesture redeems it. Distance control holds; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices structural details, Liora speaks in gnomic fragments). Dialogue is spare and purposeful ("Took you long enough," "Then teach me the codes"). Two frictions lower the grade: "featherly determined" appears twice as a descriptor but never roots in Elias's or Liora's idiolect (it reads authorial); and the firefly-chamber beat shifts into elevated diction ("the sacred shake of the world when you stand exactly where you're meant to be") that exceeds both characters' established registers under the stated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in tight third with Elara throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the observation-deck scene, broader in the final paragraph). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "softly ingenious," "held breath finally released," "the ocean had its own way of keeping time." Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Elara's question to Kael, his non-verbal response). The prose rhythm shifts under emotional pressure without losing coherence. One micro-slip: "captivated—not by the light, but by the way it made the burnt feather...cast shadows" introduces Kael's perception with unwarranted certainty when Elara is the focalizer, a brief filter leak that does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture ("sea-foam recollectionist," "cheerful gloom," "breadcrumbs of possibility"). Diction is elevated and consistent. Perceptual filter is present (colors only she can decipher, memories humming). No dialogue to evaluate. The phrase "Of course, she thought" is a minor filter intrusion, and some stock constructions appear ("her heart heavier," "the weight of a thousand"), but voice remains coherent under pressure and the final cadence charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lior notices variables (shadow length, wave crest, torch flicker) through a performer's calculus. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. The dialogue with the moth-woman is spare, subtext-driven, and distinct from Lior's interior idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "not angry, just certain" briefly narrates her interior with unwarranted certainty, but the effect is local and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric texture: "blade unsheathed," "obsidian grace," "the cold weight of something finally true." Psychic distance remains controlled; the narrator's perceptual signature is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, matching the ritual's gravity without unmotivated register drift. No dialogue on the page. Free indirect style is clean; the piece sustains its ceremonial cadence under pressure without flattening into summary. A few filter verbs ("she had always known," "she would call") are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices weight, texture, light refraction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully ("He wasn't praying. He was communing"). Diction fits a glazier's idiom ("oilcloth apron," "noctilucent reckonings" attributed to the daughter, not Elias). Minor slip: "as if the world were too tired to be sharp" in the opening risks elevated lyricism outside Elias's likely lexicon, though it's framed as the daughter's question. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited with stable, close psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (fire-aware, tactile, grief-soaked). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("gravel voice," "quiet that settled like ash," "veins, pulsing with something unspoken"). Internal voice modulates with pressure—compressed syntax during the phone call memory, expansive lyricism at moonrise. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects Elias's mind: practical, metaphor-heavy when under emotional load, sparse during action. Minor note: "gently skilled work" and "slow dance of celestial bodies" drift slightly elevated but remain within a firefighter's reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean; Liora's perceptual signature (seeing equations in shells, tracking timelines) is character-specific and consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with lyric cadence ("the dream and the logic twined like the kelp in her hands") supporting the accumulative mode. No head-hopping or POV leakage. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the space between what was and what could be, if only the patterns held") that risks detachment from embodied pressure, and some lines approach stock lyricism ("luminous ink," "constellations"). The voice remains singular but does not modulate sharply under stress, which fits the serene tone yet limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elias's perceptions. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the mother's-eyes recognition ("He hadn't thought of her in years"), mid-distance during exploration, and slightly elevated at the reflective closure. Diction is consistent and literary without register breaks; the prose carries a distinct, melancholy texture. Elias's perceptual signature (sensitively perceptive ear, focus on echoes and textures) is maintained. No dialogue appears. One minor note: "The ivy outside rustled, as if listening" and "the sealed door was gone" read slightly omniscient rather than filtered through Elias's direct observation, though they remain within lyric license for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, third-person close; psychic distance is stable and Liora's perceptual signature—calm, methodical, attuned to coded lullabies and borrowed pulses—is consistent throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("slick with rain," "fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones," "her breath curling into the spring air") that modulates naturally with emotional beats. Purposeful compression in the opening and the final sequence teaches the pattern and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity. The single line of dialogue ("Show me my son as he could be") is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the narrative stance remains elegiac and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization on Veyra; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the signature exchange, slight zoom at the walk away). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Kael's "bring stronger ink" is simultaneously threat and acceptance. Voice is consistent with elevated diction ("operatively gentle," "celestial bodies") that fits a ritualized negotiation context. Minor slip: "his voice was already unraveling, already human" leans on "already" twice in quick succession, creating mild template cadence in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices cracks as veins, salt as wound, thunder as unfulfilled promise. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("slow violence," "careful, amoral math"). Purposeful compression and elision (decades of drought-manufacturing summarized) serve the lyric design. However, peak interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("he did not calculate the cost… for the first time in years") that reads slightly over-articulated for a man mid-crisis. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature (breath as fog, fingertips on frost) is present and body-anchored. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, consistent with the tone but occasionally slipping into generic poeticism ("living poem of restraint," "vessel for what the world had tried to erase") that could apply to any defiant figure. Psychic distance stays controlled; no head-hopping. The elevated register fits the fairy-tale frame, yet syntactic variety is limited—many sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrase in predictable alternation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is distinct and poetic, with controlled diction and rhythm ("meteor hush," "puppet's string"). However, register drifts into elevated lyric phrasing pervasively ("the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match—when words still hum in the bones"), sometimes at odds with a calligrapher's practiced, embodied POV. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable, but the heightened figuration in nearly every sentence flattens differentiation between reflective and urgent beats. Free indirect style is clean; focalization remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("breath held too long," "blushing stillness") that modulates with the scene's rhythm. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lior notices wind, light, and ephemera. No dialogue. Purposeful compression and poetic diction fit the accumulative mode. Minor filter-verb reliance ("thought he saw," "wondered if") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Elira, and perceptual signature reflects her craft background (wax, flame, silver, casting). Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the ritual frame. However, diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("the long white," "snowmelt ardor," "marrow") that reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the names *move*") are sparse and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, and the final image holds focalization cleanly. The elevated register is consistent but lacks the grit or idiosyncrasy that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly controlled; narrative certainty matches Lior's knowledge, and perceptual signature (the grandmother's riddles, Lior as "the one who asked why") is consistent. Diction is purposeful and voice-specific: "swallowing its own echoes," "ghost of machine oil," "wind through dead leaves." The prose modulates with emotional intensity—clipped urgency during the transformation, slower rhythm during the film's revelation. Dialogue (dream-Lior's lines) carries subtext and advances theme without exposition. Filter verbs ("knew," "understood") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Psychic distance narrows effectively during peak beats. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated, lyric diction ("frugal rhythm," "schematic of intersecting angles") matches the astronomer's scholarly perceptual signature. POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Distance modulates purposefully (close during the tile examination, wider during the descent). Internal thought is consistently voice-motivated. One minor deduction: phrases like "empirically ironic thrill" and "dialogue at last begun" drift slightly into authorial commentary rather than staying fully inside Qishti's perceptual lexicon under pressure, but the effect is minor and does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV focalization holds throughout; Lior's perceptual signature—tracing cracks, feeling vibrations "in the bones," ache in chest—remains consistent and embodied under pressure. Dialogue with the boy-ghost carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You're still holding it" / "It's not the same as holding you responsible"), and Kael's voice shifts purposefully from twelve-year-old grin to scarred adult smirk, signaling memory-layer rather than head-hopping. One friction: "cellular memory" as method appears late and is told rather than shown through enacted perception; the phrase risks register drift into pseudo-scientific diction outside Lior's established idiom, though it does not break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (tracing, pressing, breathing, exhaling). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the peak beat ("let the fog take him"). The prose texture is consistent with lyric compression and metaphor-heavy diction appropriate to the mirror maker's craft. However, elevated register ("careless hand," "runaway kite," "second skin") occasionally drifts from the artisan's grounded idiom without clear voice motivation. Filter verbs ("felt the faintest hum," "seemed to hold its breath") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy and preventing access to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in the mender's perceptual signature: quartz-dust touch, pulse-reading, the ribbon as "bruised twilight." Diction is consistently lyric-tactile ("the contract was dust / The vow was not") without register breaks. The daughter's voice in flashback ("Vows are deciduous") and the orchard's whispered reply ("You taught me to read the cracks. Why didn't you read mine?") are clearly sourced and distinct from narration. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during digging, pulls back for final summary lines). No head-hopping; all knowledge remains character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: "bewildered eyes, same hunger," "sharp and bright" laughter, and perceptual details like sap-graffiti are character-specific. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The reflection's layered-static speech and the wind's sigh feel purposeful. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. Minor slip: the orchard's exposition in the middle third ("protected. From people who…") briefly adopts an external narrator's summarizing register rather than Veyra's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elias with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is clear in his hearing "whispers between words" and "calculating how to exploit." Diction is elevated and literary ("slumbering titan," "renewable resource," "old parchment") without register breaks. The traveler's direct speech ("You lied," "Her name was Liora") contrasts with Elias's smooth manipulation, though the traveler's voice could be more distinct in lexicon. Free indirect style is clean. One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening ("adjusted," "stepped") doesn't obscure immediacy. The closing shift to omniscient framing ("Somewhere, a clock ticked backward") slightly loosens focalization but serves the resonant ending without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora with consistent perceptual bias (vivid colors, haunted carnival imagery). Diction is lyric and elevated throughout, which fits the gothic fairy-tale register but occasionally drifts into over-poetic phrasing that flattens urgency ("a silhouette in the garden of forgotten names, reaching through the glass"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at peak beats (pressing the swatch, tearing the page). Register remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; Elara's perceptual signature ("warmly methodical," archive vocabulary) is consistent. Dialogue between Elara and the figure carries subtext ("You're late" / "Time moves differently") and advances plot. However, the figure's speech—"Stories that only exist when you're not looking"—converges with the narrator's elevated register rather than feeling distinct, and the final reflection ("how to document what couldn't be documented") drifts into expository summary rather than staying in Elara's embodied present stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tight to Eldrin's perceptual signature: he reads echoes, traces fingers along walls, listens to silence. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("ripple-mark mapkeeper," "bloom of hush," "hammered into repose") but voice-motivated by his role. Distance modulates purposefully—closer during conjuring ("unspooling the tension in his own bones"), wider during the beings' response. Psychic certainty matches what Eldrin can know; when the beings "had not expected," it's inferred from their visible flicker, not unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices star-path grooves, the hush's pulse, coincidences as threads. The prose rhythm modulates under pressure ("The prism groaned. / Then…it *mended*") without breaking voice. Filter verbs ("convinced," "heard") are voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue, so those bullets are moot. One mild register slip: "retrocognitively blessed" reads clinical for the ruined-world idiom, though it's plausibly a relic term she'd internalize. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at the beacon flare and the final step into wind.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose maintains a distinct, lyric voice with controlled distance and purposeful compression ("the breath of the unspoken," "the shadow of the central monument had bled into an uneven stain"). Psychic distance is stable; POV knowledge remains consistent. Some lines in the final third approach elevated diction that lightly tensions the established register ("chiseling her own edges against the collective memory"), but the effect remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Liora's perceptual signature (fireworks designer's eye for light, chant habit born of loneliness). Diction is consistent and lyric: "petals like embers caught in slow motion," "the hush was thick enough to chew." However, under peak stress (rocket launch, fortress trembling), the prose does not compress; instead it expands into elevated metaphor ("net of silver threads") that risks distance drift. The villagers' dialogue is minimal but functional. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "the world was heavier than it had been yesterday" is too abstract for a focalizer in motion; "her boots felt heavier" would anchor better.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on the chronicler; perceptual signature is strong (tangential approach, crab-like observation, tidal-pool layering). Diction remains consistent and poetic without register clash, and the chronicler's interior voice is distinct. The fisherman's brief dialogue ("You don't have to say it") carries subtext and feels natural. Filter verbs ("she saw it," "she understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure: short, breathless when the cicada warms; longer, reflective in the grotto. No head-hopping, no dialogue convergence. Psychic distance shifts purposefully from close interior to wider observation. One minor note: the cicada "didn't sing for the impatient" could be crisper, but the effect is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited, anchored to the child's synesthetic perception ("cool, expanding, the way frost tastes before it burns"). Distance is stable; the doll's voice is clearly marked and external. Perceptual signature is strong: silence as flavor, gravity as "held breath," the trellis as underwater lattice. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the father's "stay down" and "They're coming" advance pressure. Some sentences lean on elevated register ("intangibly tangible," "throbbing quiet") that edges past the child's twelve-year voice under stress, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; distance is controlled, and his perceptual signature (monitoring absence of sound, reading the vial's pulse) is character-specific. Diction elevates consistently—"vaulting hush," "fluid logic of transit," "traceries of what had passed through"—but the register skews poetic in ways that occasionally drift from a working gondola operator's idiom under pressure. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("It doesn't erase it… gives it somewhere to go"), carrying subtext without exposition. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately from observation to interaction to reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is lush and elevated ("wisely adventurous," "kaleidoscope of shifting hues") and stays voice-motivated throughout. Perceptual signature (lore-keeper's scholarly attention to murals, equations, inscriptions) is character-specific. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy. Minor register drift: "wisely adventurous" and "the age of choosing had begun" edge toward prompt-language rather than lived perception, but these remain exceptions rather than patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression, metaphoric density, syntactic rhythm that modulates with pressure. POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization. The shadow's dialogue feels purposeful and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present—Lior notices scars, breath, weight—and diction remains character-bound. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance tightens during high-pressure beats (bolt-turning, vision of the *Eidolon*) and expands for reflection on the pyramid scheme and her mother. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lina notices leverage, recognizes "broken faith," thinks in transactional terms ("exchange rate for diamonds"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond her survivor pragmatism: "shadowseam and shimmering," "the slow grind of something vast and patient" feel authorial rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's lyricism ("the night, for once, didn't demand a thing") modulates tone effectively but risks losing Lina's specific voice. No dialogue present; internal voice carries the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; distance and filter use ("as he had every evening," "Of course") fit the reflective register. The prose carries a consistent lyric texture with purposeful figurative density ("golden shadows stretched like lazy fingers," "ink in rain"). However, elevated diction in high-pressure beats ("eloquently silent," "marrow of his skull," "culminated in this") occasionally drifts above the immediate perceptual grounding, and the narratorial certainty in metaphysical moments ("the bridge, it turned out, had been waiting") softens urgency, preventing entry to the 7.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register and metaphor-dense texture. The narrative voice is distinctive, but diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("echo of a color no human eye had named") that risks over-lyricism in a sustained run. The knight's internal voice stays consistent, yet the prose texture does not modulate under peak pressure—figurative density remains high throughout rather than tightening in crisis. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance is controlled, but the voice reads more as authorial performance than as character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; perceptual signature is strong (archivist's eye for thin files, dust patterns, staple-bound lives). Diction fits character: "bureaucratic silt," "relic buried," "stubborn insistence on connection" read as Elias's internal lexicon without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the button discovery (trembling hands, quickening pulse), pulled back for the imagined Daniel scene. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor issue: the phrase "tactfully hopeful" in "Daniel had done the same—tactfully hopeful" reads slightly outside natural thought rhythm, closer to prompt echo than organic perception. The prose maintains character-specific texture throughout, with sentence rhythm varying under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable across four time shards with clean section breaks and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific (archivist's eye for scraps, receipts, "the puddles' language"). Diction remains consistent—elevated but not academic, lyric but grounded. Rook's dialogue via water-static carries distinct cadence. However, some late-story lines ("The fight wasn't in the streets. / It was in the cracks") inch toward thesis-voice rather than Lena's embodied thought, and the final shard's reflective summary ("historians would call it") shifts to a more omniscient register, creating minor distance drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: "negative space between vibrations," "pockets where the words couldn't take root." POV distance is stable third-limited with free indirect coloring. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that tests the saxophonist's lexicon: "vested hush," "Resonant Reconfiguration" feel authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during performance, wider during transit), and the prose rhythm reflects the protagonist's musician mindset. Brief compression at the return ("The mist welcomed him back at dawn") fits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is task-oriented (fingers deft, seeds that hum, leaves spelling runes) and voice remains lyric-elevated throughout. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "the hush wasn't a pause after all. It was an inhale" modulates naturally with the beat. No head-hopping. The elevated register (iridescent, filament, First Song, cabochon) stays consistent with the fable-like world. Minor slip: "She had always known the work of sorting was never truly about order" briefly steps into hindsight summary rather than present realization, but recovery is swift. Purposeful compression and fragment structures ("Not for locks, but for the language") serve the lyric mode without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: diction favors particulars ("bone-yard," "half-burned letters," "tuning fork struck against fate"), rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts in the cavern, longer cadences in reflection). POV remains stable third-limited; the tinkerer's perceptual signature—noticing broken, liminal things—is consistent. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens during key beats (compass hum, waterfall question). Minor: a few phrases ("uncertainly certain," "practicing") approach whimsy without full voice grounding, and some figurative turns ("fate," "parade") feel slightly elevated for a tinkerer's interior, but remain largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; diction ("factually mystical," "kintsugi intentions") reflects her alchemical idiom. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (coin feeding) and the prose rhythm modulates well. One friction: phrases like "the alchemy of *meaning*" and "luminous regret" occasionally drift into elevated register that feels slightly authorial rather than strictly Liora's lived lexicon under stress. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Liora's perceptual signature: souls as burrs, the tooth as memory, the gorge as conspirator. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, balancing lyric elevation ("pale gold mist curling through jagged teeth") with concrete action (plucking strings, scattering petals). Dialogue with the ghost is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext in the joke exchange. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the encounter. One minor register slip: "integration" and "stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings" leans slightly abstract for a character in the moment, though it remains plausible as Liora's professional idiom. No head-hopping, and the narrator's certainty matches what Liora can know.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liran's sensory hypersensitivity. Diction is elevated and lyric ("proprioception screaming," "harmonic resonance that peeled back his skin"), consistent with a trauma-informed, intellectually precise focalizer, though some phrases ("the math of mercy had no answer / Only an echo") approach thematic summary. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight in the basin ordeal, slightly wider in the final paragraph's release. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("the elusively tangible," "stories that had been waiting, patient as tides") that remains consistent but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism under peak pressure ("the between," "the spaces between childhood and now"). Psychic distance is close, tracking Lior's perceptions and micro-choices (tracing the name, slotting the lens, pocketing the brush), though some lines read as authorial summary rather than character-specific thought. The painter's dialogue is spare and carries subtext ("Unfasten the past," "Some histories aren't overlooked—they're *held*"), but her "teeth sharp with knowing" is a visual assertion rather than dramatized menace. Perceptual signature is present (Lior notices sensory-intuitive cues: scent, hum, pulse), yet the diction converges toward thematic statement at closure rather than maintaining character-particular idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature—reading dust as language, knowing "fatigue didn't leave cracks that pulsed"—is character-specific and selective. Voice modulates appropriately from patient observation to accelerated action ("His fingers worked faster now"). The ghost dialogue is minimal and atmospheric. However, register occasionally drifts elevated without motivation: "the slow unspooling of shadows, the way dust motes hung suspended like tiny, forgotten acrobats" reads more literary-omniscient than a repair tech's natural noticing under pressure, even one who sees ghosts. Free indirect thought is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable, third-person limited to Elias, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("his fingers tracing the spines of volumes that hummed") but leans on elevated register ("liquid time, siphoned from moments the world had forgotten") that occasionally drifts from embodied interiority into narrated abstraction. The prose modulates with pressure, compressing at the rupture, but some peak-beat lines ("he had finally printed something true") read as thesis rather than thought. No dialogue present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias as poet-revolutionary. Diction is controlled and textured ("baroque spires," "burnished sorrow," "strands thick as rope"). However, the narration occasionally slips into helpful-narrator mode, over-explaining the vase's function ("it had *refracted* it, bending moments like light") and the priestesses' belief about mirrors in a way that flattens urgency. Taelis's single line of dialogue is functional but generic, and the piece offers no second voice for contrast. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the elevated register never modulates under pressure, which limits dynamism. Free indirect style is clean, and there is no head-hopping, but the lack of rhythmic or syntactic variation during the climax (the vision) keeps this in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct: compressed syntax, lyric fragments ("Not a tune, but a pull"), elevated diction ("covenant of rust," "harmonic tug like a fishhook in the ribs"). POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("mending what isn't torn—not the object, but the space between its purpose and its pain") that risks sounding thesis-like rather than Elias's lived thought. The two brief dialogue lines (woman's whisper, rust's voice) feel purposeful. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax. Perceptual signature (repairer's lens on gears, seams, solder) is present but could be more embodied under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited with tight focalization through Elias; distance is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is consistent (collector's attention to scent, texture, sound). Diction matches the character: "petrichor," "psychometry," "hinged awakenings" fit a self-taught delver. Minor slip: "the shape of its absence, the quiet where understanding ended and something else began" in the final third edges toward elevated abstraction, though it remains voice-plausible. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the chamber sequence (suspended, arches humming, father's voice) maintains clarity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering setting and action through Elias's driftwood sculptor's eye ("bones of the world, the way time carved and connected"). Diction is consistent and elevated but character-appropriate for an artist. One brief conversation at the docks distinguishes the woman's brisk pragmatism from Elias's reflective voice. Perceptual signature is strong (carving metaphors, attention to material and form). However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository register ("*timewoven alliances*—not images, but moments stitched into light") that feels more authorial than Elias's idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Liora's artistic sensibility ("petals so vivid they seemed to breathe"). Diction is elevated but consistent with her contemplative stance. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained through closure. Perceptual signature is present in her focus on layers, light, and silence. Minor slip: some rhetorical flourishes ("a lantern in the gathering dark," "the night was endless") lean toward generic poetic register rather than character-specific idiom, and the final third contains repetitive syntactic stems ("The pavilion stood. The flowers listened. And the world, for a moment, was perfect").

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (archivist's precision, "cataloging the silences") is distinctive. Diction modulates purposefully under pressure (short clauses during the standoff). The officers' sparse dialogue ("trespassing on restricted memory") carries subtext, and Elias's cryptic reply ("it wants you") advances the beat. Filter verbs ("realized," "saw") are voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: "floating library was supposed to be neutral ground" tells the premise rather than embodying it in a micro-choice or reflection anchored to present stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; the alchemist's perceptual signature (distilling moonlight, blueprints from air) colors narration with alchemical idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the bottle sequence, wider at the opening and close. One dialogue line ("Uncle, are you making the lanterns again?") feels natural and advances plot, vanishing before it can test distinctness. Minor slip: "the stubborn *there*-ness of memory given form" briefly elevates diction beyond the established voice, though it recovers quickly. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is tightly held to Elias throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone," "the way his class had pressed ears to the phonograph's horn, giggling." Distance modulates purposefully (close in the prophecy beat, wider in the memory of field trips). Diction remains within an elevated, archival register consistent with an oath scribe's idiom ("hinges held doors neither open nor shut"). Under peak stress (hands shaking, voice pressing to temple), the syntax tightens without obscuring clarity. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. One minor slip: "curious and insistent" in paragraph one leans slightly generic for this otherwise textured voice, but does not materially harm the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora with a distinct perceptual signature (grandmother's hands as gnarled oak roots, breath as smoke). The prose modulates effectively under pressure: short urgent beats during the vortex's howl, longer reflective passages during memory. Two register slips: "furiously tranquil" reads as author-imposed oxymoron rather than Liora's interior vocabulary, and "Entropy was a lock, and the key was patience twisted backward" sounds like external narration explaining rather than her lived thought. Filter verbs ("She knew," "She watched") are acceptable and voice-motivated. Diction remains mostly consistent with a nature-focused, archaic-tinged register.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices microclimates, tensions, and resonances—his way of seeing is selective and technical yet poetic. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "the wind's breath against the sanctuary's bones," "blade through mist," "spaces between its wails." Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the rope work. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects the mind of a careful listener under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("cradle of unseen growth," "moment of surrender"), which matches the contemplative voice but edges toward register uniformity—every beat carries the same poetic density regardless of pressure. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean when used. The perceptual signature (patient, spiritually attuned) is character-specific, though the prose texture does not modulate notably during the alarm/star-merge climax, missing an opportunity for compression or rhythm shift under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (beekeeper reading wind through glass cracks, gauging ghost-pressure as "teeth ache") is distinct and apt. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate at box-opening, panoramic in coda). Diction stays character-consistent except minor register drift: "tranquilly perceptive" and "counterbalance" feel slightly elevated for a mute recluse's interior lexicon. No head-hopping; tense and stance hold. The coda's shift to traveler perspective is clearly signaled and serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "stubborn energy," "frayed edges of moments," "fossilized spring." The prose carries a distinct texture through metaphor and rhythm. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats (the climax at the workbench) risks slight overwriting but remains legible. No head-hopping; psychic distance is appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable psychic distance and consistent perceptual signature: the poet notices texture (iridescent, frayed, barbed), sound (the kite's crack, the breeze in the feather shaft), and metaphor-ready images (oil on water, bruise healing). Diction remains lyric-elevated but voice-coherent throughout. No dialogue to assess. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure (shorter beats when the feather trembles, longer when reflecting on the boat). Filter verbs ("he saw," "he thought") are minimal and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; interiority stays particular to this character's aesthetic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited, Elira-focused throughout with clean distance; Tomas's brief POV in the final beats is section-separated and legible. Voice texture: "The pillars sighed, welcoming another pair of hands" and "her smile slow and brazen" carry distinct rhythm. Diction stays grounded in the caretaker's idiom—"corrupt their purity," "begging" vs. "asking"—without register drift. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Tomas's "You're teaching them to beg" and Elira's correction advance the theme through action. The penultimate paragraph's shift to Tomas is clean (new subject, new stance) and the ending's "He began to weave" holds focalization without head-hopping. Minor: "tuneless thing" leans generic, and the orchard's "whisper" risks personification without POV anchor, but the effect supports pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; Elara's perceptual signature (tracing grooves, breath fogging metal, throat tightening) is consistent and embodied. The prose rhythm modulates well with pressure, and the figure's dialogue ("voice like rain on bronze") is distinct. However, some diction drifts into elevated register ("pilgrimage hypothesis," "ozone and old paper") that feels more authorial than scientist-under-pressure. The terminal's question format is clean, but the figure's single line could carry more subtext. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: the baroque diction ("broken rib," "syllables curling from his throat like smoke") and heightened register fit the mythic, ritual tone. POV remains stable in third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—filtered through the coachman's attention to natural signs—and the psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to distant retrospect. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "submerged concord" and "green vengeance" that feel authorial rather than character-particular, but the effect is cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Rook throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scent, old joints, bloodhound instinct) but could be more character-particular. Diction is lyric and controlled ("sky bled into the land," "roots whispered the names of the lost") with purposeful compression, though some phrases veer toward stock lyricism ("wild hush," "warm, damp dark"). Register stays consistent. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure, but a few filter verbs ("listened as") dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Lira's attention filters through observer training (charcoal smudges, constellation labels) and tactile engagement (tracing the applique, breath fogging glass). Diction stays consistent—"blessed pariah," "true north," "echoed silence"—without register drift. One minor slip: "temporally stretched, just like the stories said" briefly exits Lira's immediate perception into meta-commentary. The final sequence maintains compression under stress ("didn't wait," "pushed off") with rhythmic control that supports urgency without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric-fantastical register: "needle of black ice piercing the belly of the wrong sky," "sacredly playful," "wind howled with voices not quite human." Diction stays internally consistent, though elevated phrasing ("shrine to stillness," "slithered from the dark") occasionally tilts toward decorative rather than urgent. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the Keeper's "You think time is a thing to be stolen?" and Lirien's "I think it's a thing to be amended" carry subtext and goal-pursuit. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. One hiccup: "The question hung in the air, unanswered" in the penultimate beat edges toward meta-commentary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register with strong rhythmic control ("remember, then unbind, then tell"). Free indirect access to Liora's perceptions is clean, though the diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("benevolently ruthless thing," "luminous absence") that risks obscuring concrete stakes. Minimal dialogue; the two lines Liora speaks on the page feel more like incantation than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-limited focalization holds throughout; perceptual signature (mercury-glass eyes leaving silver streaks, seeing dreams as substitutes for reality) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. However, elevated register occasionally drifts toward poetic convenience: "the texture of a feather, the way it caught light like a held breath" reads as authorial rather than Elias's interior idiom under stress. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming from external action to memory flashes to present realization), and the final paragraph's declarative simplicity ("Some doors were meant to stay closed. Others were meant to be built.") fits the resolute tone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (chess idiom, metaphors of moves and boards). The girl's dialogue carries subtext and distinction ("You left before the end" reads as invitation, not accusation). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "the fierce repose of a board reset after checkmate," "the quiet alchemy of forgiveness." Under the tutor's stress, syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Dialogue mechanics are conventional and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited maintains tight focus on Liora's perceptions: "her ears tuned to the fractures in their voices," "breath came quick, her pulse a counterpoint." Diction fits her defiant, poetic stance—"lie," "arrows," "bone-dust"—and elevated register at peaks ("opalescent," "penitent") reads voice-motivated for a character who "slips poems into prayer bowls." One slip: "The canyon breathed before dawn" and "humming with the weight of unspoken names" in the opening feel slightly detached from Liora's grounded anger elsewhere, a minor POV waver. No dialogue present to assess. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climb and carving.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during key insertion, pulled back during the transformation). The alchemist's perceptual signature—seeing the world through the lens of repair and unfinished work—remains consistent and voice-specific ("You stitch together what others break, but you'll never know if it holds"). Diction is elevated but character-appropriate for an alchemist narrating their own ritual. Minor slip: the sudden shift to direct address in the narrated confessions ("I took the charm...") introduces a brief ambiguity about audience (statue? void? reader?) that is clarified by context but momentarily disrupts the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, filtering setting through Elias's grief-saturated attention (ochre as rust-red cliffs, the shell's "impossible sunsets"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices pigment, color, light. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching an artist's idiom ("ghosting over," "splintering time," "exhaled"). No dialogue appears. However, the final paragraphs drift into external narration—"The villagers would call it suicide. But Elias knew better"—which breaks psychic distance at the closure beat. The phrase "intimately, achingly *known*" risks label-speak but is anchored by the water-drinking image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is consistent (sensory focus on vibrations, scent, tactile cork). Elias's diction—"vibrations of intent," "screaming only in its precision"—is poetic but coherent with his introspective character. Harkin's dialogue ("You been messing with the horn again?") and his lack of articulation at the recognition beat distinguish him. Minor slip: the phrase "the kind that comes when a man realizes" in Harkin's moment leans slightly explanatory rather than fully trusting embodied gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tight; perception is filtered through Lena's professional past (charts, coordinates, radio voice) and present specificity (patchwork, driftwood towers, string-and-nail maps). Diction stays consistent—concrete, tactile, maritime—with purposeful cadence modulation (short urgency in the phone exchange, longer breath in reflection). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: the caller's riddles and Lena's translation advance plot and reveal subtext. Filter verbs are light; psychic distance stays close. Voice distinction between Lena's narration and the caller's rough static is clear. No head-hopping; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and close. Perceptual signature is distinct: Lior notices patterns (mist curls, wind pitch), occludes rather than hides, tastes grief in the truffle. Diction is elevated but consistent ("unspooled the threads of trust," "stars hung like pins"), rhythmically varied, and voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page; the warlord's hypothetical questions are framed as interior rehearsal, maintaining POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is specific: "the way the tide hesitated," "the way seagulls fell quiet," "gaps" as method. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("opal dock," "breath of the sea," "driftwood voice"). The stranger's whispered line carries natural subtext. Register holds under pressure; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "That was the trouble with borrowed memories: they never quite fit" edges toward helpful-narrator commentary rather than staying strictly interior, but it's brief and the texture recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly, filtering all perception through Elias's map-dealer lens ("parchment and scale," "margins and age"). Diction stays character-particular: "foxfire trapped in metal," "printer's myths," "empirically intuitive by nature." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during chip-handling, wider during the ant procession—and no head-hopping occurs. The woman's two lines of dialogue carry subtext and distinct idiom. One slip: the phrase "Some promises, it turned out, were doorways all their own" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward narrator omniscience rather than Elias's present realization, briefly loosening focalization just before the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; the queen's perceptual signature (softly commanding mist, breath measured, violet as *wrong*) is distinct and consistent. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from measured observation ("the air grew thin") to intimate crisis ("a thousand needles stitching her skin to the sky"). One register slip: "bargains struck in bloodless innocence" and "the kindest kind of bleeding" edge toward elevated poeticism that strains against the queen's established practical voice under duress. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices light, warmth, resonance—but diction drifts toward elevated register ("ozone and old parchment," "directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic") that clashes with the urgency of a peak moment. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Liora's lines ("You said you wanted to capture presence... But you've been measuring the wrong thing") feel more thematic than subtext-driven. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated. Under peak stress (the jump), compression is acceptable, yet the narration stays uniformly lyric without embodied degradation. Distance control is stable, but the voice reads more as authored synthesis than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Older Elias's POV with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "sheer weight of revision," "static," "wound" metaphors recur in character-specific ways. The dialogue between Eliases is terse and goal-driven ("You're early" / "You're late"), carrying subtext about cyclical inevitability. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("chronicler who'd outlived his own story") that feels slightly authorial, but voice remains largely coherent under pressure. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance modulates purposefully (tight on his thumb tracing corrosion, pulling back for the shop's atmosphere). Diction is consistent—"ghosts" of lavender, "liquid time," "occluded views"—and lexicon fits an artisan/observational mind. The woman's italicized speech is spare and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("I think she was trying to tell me something"). One weakness: "trembling calm" as described tone occasionally tips into over-sculpted lyricism ("each drop a pause, a breath, a choice") that flattens urgency in favor of cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Lian's perceptual signature (noticing the quill's obsidian glint, the crow's slick feathers, ozone scent) remains selective and embodied. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the rune-tracing beat, pulling back slightly at "She understood then" to accommodate realization. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "the saturated hush of the valley, where even the rocks seemed to lean in closer." However, some late-paragraph intrusions ("Somewhere, her grandmother was smiling. / Somewhere, the storm was learning her language") shift toward omniscient lyricism that blurs the POV's spatial anchoring. The final repetition of "Somewhere" feels like poetic scaffolding rather than Lian's particular internal voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—metaphors as tools, the perfume bottle as extension of her craft—is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You always did love your metaphors" / "Words are easy. This?"), carrying subtext and advancing plot. Rhythm modulates appropriately: short declaratives during the perfume's surge ("It hurts." / "Good."), longer descriptive cadences in the opening and closing frames. Minor slip: the final aside paragraphs ("Later, when the city asked…" / "She never told them…") shift into summary-explanatory mode, slightly loosening the tight third-limited texture that held through the main scene. The shift is brief and doesn't disrupt the core voice, but it introduces a reportorial distance that wasn't present earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a controlled distance and mythic register ("dust motes hung like suspended stars"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") that strains against the spare, present-tense action. The final sequence maintains rhythmic control, and the single-POV interiority stays coherent. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—the witness notices metaphysical qualities rather than idiosyncratic detail tied to his history or personality.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: "cracked in a jagged smile," "like calling a man who tends to storms a 'wind gardener,'" the razor-edge metaphor threaded through. POV remains tight to Elias; knowledge stays character-bound (Bureau logs, father's teaching). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority during counting to the dissociative moment of standing in two places. The woman's dialogue is brief and functional. Diction stays consistent under stress; no filter stacks or head-hopping. Minor: "eminently peculiar" in the third paragraph reads slightly authorial rather than Elias's natural thought pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with strong perceptual signature: "theoretically rebellious energy," "cold comfort of numbers," "clover-melancholy." Diction stays within Lila's academic-yet-restless register. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The prose modulates well under pressure—short sentences at peak moments ("Lila sat." "She followed.") contrast with longer reflective spirals earlier. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster in the middle passage ("she'd spent," "she'd followed," "he'd spent") that slightly dulls immediacy, and the phrase "train of thought" metaphor mixing with "seams" and "frayed logic" creates brief vehicle confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias; perceptual signature is distinct (graffiti tags, ozone, glass disc vibrations). Voice is consistent, lyric, and compressed with purposeful fragments ("Loop back"). Dialogue, when present, carries subtext ("I don't know how to hang up" / "Then why do I feel so alone?"). Psychic distance modulates aptly, tightening during the caller's breakdown. Filter verbs ("let her," "almost said") are voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; the caller's interiority is accessed only through her voice and breath. Diction remains within Elias's register; no unmotivated corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is consistent—archival focus on ink, vellum, preservation—and diction fits the character ("walnut-ink," "poorly sized paper," "proximate causes"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("wondered if the new covenant would hold") to wider lyric register at closure. Minor register drift: "euphoria, haunted by what could have been" reads slightly elevated for the immediate moment, though it serves the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "swallowing its own echoes," "slow-motion earthquake," "NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY" carry idiosyncratic texture. POV remains stable; Lena's perceptual filter (logistician's eye for systems, elusive necessity) shapes what she notices. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("You're looking for the doctor" / "I'm looking for someone who understands reciprocity"). One brief register slip: "synthesized a cure for loneliness—not the poetic kind" over-explains in a way that breaks the established voice's compression.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a poetic, measured voice that suits the lyric-accumulative mode. Perceptual signature is clear: Elian perceives through vibration, taste, and temperature rather than sight. Diction is elevated and consistent ("unfold," "dowsing," "quiet blaze") but occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("shimmering chord," "quiet fire") that flattens specificity. No dialogue to judge. The prose reads as character-particular but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; the cadence remains serene and even throughout, even at the climactic stillpoint discovery. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds consistently; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature (meteorite nib, "echoes of decisions unmade," "tapestry of half-remembered constellations"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider philosophical framing. However, register occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("contingent relationships," "resonance," "layered") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The prose reads as authorial meditation on Elias's experience rather than Elias's own syntax under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Compression and pattern-teaching are legible; the piece establishes its lyric mode early and sustains it.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with tight focalization on Elias and Liora. "Her charisma the quiet kind that made people lean in" and "a blade wrapped in velvet" are register-drift metaphors unsuited to the urgency of the moment. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("You're mapping silence again," "Someone remembers"), carrying subtext, but Liora's snarl ("You don't get to keep them") lacks grounding in prior personal stake. No head-hopping; distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and maintained: lyric compression, elevated diction, and patterned metaphor (archive as tomb/womb, fire as mercy) cohere throughout. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The perceptual signature—Elias reading hidden geometry, tracing symbols—is character-specific. Minor register drift: phrases like "analytically intuitive" and "volcanic tenderness" feel authorial rather than Elias's natural idiom under stress, but the effect is consistent and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices frequencies, crystalline reeds, ghostly afterglows. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated register ("auroral sorrow," "vault of auroral sorrow") risks ornamental excess. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the drumming, pulling back for cosmic exhalation). No dialogue present. The piece teaches a lyric, compression-driven pattern early and sustains it through closure. Minor slip: "concentric rings" and "liquid exhale" feel stock in an otherwise fresh voice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Lior reads walks as confessions, notices rust and metal groans, and processes the world through his maintenance role. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("sickly greens," "folded themselves into the gaps between rules"). The woman's dialogue is clipped and functional, contrasting with Lior's interior rhythm. Minor slip: "not a walk, but a *challenge*" italicizes for emphasis where rhythm should carry it, and the woman's vanishing ("dissolved into the storm's hum") shifts from concrete to metaphor without transition.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV holds to the guardian with stable psychic distance; brief shifts to the boy's perception (his jaw set, his breath fogging) remain within observable inference. The guardian's perceptual signature—watching shadows pool like forgotten promises, weaving patterns—is consistent and voice-particular. Diction remains controlled: "spiralingly calm," "the canal held them both," "half-spoken secrets" sustain a lyric register without register drift. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful: the boy's muttered lines carry subtext and advance his emotional arc. Free indirect style is clean in the boy's moments ("he didn't mean to"). Minor slip: "the way darkness wasn't the absence of stars" reads slightly over-articulated for the boy's raw state.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (chess terms, tactical framing, attention to filings and symmetry). The prose modulates appropriately, tightening at the hammer-strike beat and breathing during reflective moments. However, several lines slip into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elias-specific: "the hush where past meets prophecy," "a swarm of restless bees," "the rebellion had never been about noise." Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Did we win?" / "The game isn't over"). Free indirect style is clean. The voice is distinct but occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction that doesn't fully belong to the chess coach's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric, compressed distance that matches the mythic tone. Perceptual signature (salt, weight, edges, the sublittoral fringe) is consistent and character-particular. Purposeful compression ("He *unfolded*," "not in words, but in the press of current against current") is taught early and supports the magical-realist register. However, peak-stress moments retain elevated diction ("his ribs ached to expand, to *detach* from the weight of the land") where a tighter embodied syntax might sharpen urgency. Psychic distance stays controlled; no head-hopping. The whale's interior voice ("You kept me too long") is presented as perception rather than omniscience, maintaining focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance modulates from close ("the habit of stillness lingered") to embodied action without head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and subtext-rich ("Still breathing?" as affection-via-deflection). Perceptual signature is consistent: grief filters into objects (bouquet, tin) and textures (dust, brittle petals). Lena's interior idiom—"uselessly delicate," "thing you carried not because it hurt, but because you'd forgotten how to put it down"—is lyric without register drift. Harkin's grunt and single-beat responses feel distinct. No POV leakage. Purposeful compression in the Mandate backstory anchors without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, elevated register that matches Elira's identity as cloud-shadow poet. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices hum, tremor, dissolution—and the prose rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses when she laughs, longer when she walks the spiral). Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon throughout. One friction: the elevated register ("lantern-moth hush," "aesthetically driven") occasionally drifts into a detached, curatorial tone that undercuts immediacy at peak beats. No head-hopping, and the purposeful compression (e.g., "Not broken. *Unfolded.*") is taught and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters sensory detail through Elias's colorblind, tactile-auditory perception. Voice is distinct and controlled: "colors had never been the point" and "he felt it in the way her shoulder brushed his" show perceptual signature. Dialogue, when present, is sparse and functional. Deductions: Liora's voice is under-developed (her lines could belong to anyone), and the line "The world was full of imperfections, and he'd spent a lifetime learning to love them" drifts into summary-tell during a high-stakes closure beat, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent lyric-reflective register. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout ("shattered constellation," "trembling with possibility"), which fits the established voice but risks uniformity under pressure—moments of crisis (researchers stepping back, lens growing warm) receive the same textured treatment as calmer beats. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal (one whisper, one question) and functional. The perceptual signature is consistent but not character-particular; the narrator's way of noticing reads more authorial-poetic than distinctly Liora's professional or personal filter.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with Lena's perceptual signature: she notices wire tension, petal trembling, ink bleeding like roots. Diction remains consistent (craft-focused, tactile). The italicized mentor's voice is purposeful compression that charges memory without head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean ("She would make a pendant of it, hollow and waiting, like all the things that had yet to bloom"). No dialogue is present, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during tattooing, wider during the winter summary).

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (cartomancer's eye for symbolic pattern, tactile attention to brass and indigo). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the visitor's question and Elias's replies carry subtext without exposition. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("metastasized into a cult," "inherited mystery") but remains largely character-coherent. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (terse exchanges, longer atmospheric passages), and the final beats compress rhythm effectively. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, with a consistent elevated register and a perceptual signature rooted in metaphor and atmosphere. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person close. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("atoms of nostalgia," "photons carrying the archive's last lesson"), but the pattern is taught early and the effect is coherent. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Liora's perceptual signature—tracking "slow unraveling of shadows as if they were living things"—is specific and consistent. Diction ("softly deliberate," "metamorphose," "unbound") carries a deliberate lyricism that fits the library setting and concept-driven design. The curator's single line of dialogue ("You gave it shape") feels functional rather than character-distinct, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("petals of light unfolding") that risks decorative flourish over immediacy. Psychic distance holds, though the reflection on shareable dreams reads slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct ("a half-told lie," "sugar in rain"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight on Elias's wound-tracing, wider on backstory fragments. One slip: the Mara flashback ("*You'd ruin us for a stranger?*") shifts into free indirect without a clean cue, momentarily blurring time. Perceptual signature is consistent (healer's eye on membrane, salve, wound), and diction stays within Elias's register. Dialogue, when present, is purposeful and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Liora's perceptual signature (reading coffee rings, tracing scars) is specific and consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("splinter in the dawn," "meteor hush" tone) but remains coherent under pressure. One filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("pressed," "fogging," "pulsed") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure clarity. The plants' voices are formatted clearly and add texture without head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("The tower groaned...the earth it had been dragged from") and metaphoric density are pattern-taught and legible. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor: "She was the thing in the walls" risks abstraction but is immediately grounded by the hourglass thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "the psychometry reading struck her like a bolt," "the celluloid warming as if alive." Diction is lyric and controlled, though occasional register drift into elevated metaphor ("coil into shapes only she could decipher," "ozone and old paper") feels slightly external to a crystal gazer's working idiom. The prose maintains consistent voice under pressure, and the final beats modulate tone without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Liora's perceptual filter: she "heard the unspoken words of the sky," noticed the archway's "scars of a god's forgotten battle," and felt the instrument "pulsed warm." Diction elevates appropriately for a character who "traced constellations with her fingertips"—"ozone," "remembered stardust," "unraveled" time. However, peak-beat constructions slip into filter stacks: "she *saw*—not with her eyes, but with the part of her that had always listened to the sky" and "she *understood*: this place was a prison." The final "The sky, at last, had nothing left to say. / Except this: *You were always the key*" reads as external narration rather than Liora's thought, briefly loosening focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Hollow with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-textural signature ("iron veins of the dead earth," "petals of light unfurling") that modulates with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is selective: Hollow notices rust, locks, clocks, and sparks through a guardsman's lens. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression and fragment repetition ("The sand was green") serve the accumulative design and are taught early. Minor density concern: elevated diction ("lattice of moments," "web of divergent paths") occasionally drifts toward the authorial, but remains voice-motivated and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, perceptual signature leans poetic-philosophical. Diction is elevated and consistent, but leans generic at peaks: "quiet, electric thrill," "bright, unnameable thing." Free indirect thought is clean. No dialogue to judge. Syntax varies purposefully (short declaratives, long lyric cascades). However, the voice reads as imposed rather than character-particular—every line sounds like the narrator's essayistic register, not the philosopher's lived idiom under pressure. Rhythmic control is strong, but distinctiveness is middling.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Liora's perceptual signature: her way of noticing is shaped by years of guiding (the "metronome" lantern, the ticket-punch mechanics). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("the leash of duty had finally snapped," "the shoreline's lullaby"). Brief dialogue feels natural and carries subtext. Deductions: the woman's line "You've come back" / "I never left" exchange, while thematically resonant, carries slight artificiality in its symmetry. The final paragraph accumulates stock phrases ("held note," "quiet certainty," "let the twilight hold her") that blur into generic lyricism under emotional weight, reducing immediacy in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a lyric, compressed texture ("rusted from disuse," "frostbitten hope") that modulates with pressure. The pianist cannot speak, so no dialogue friction; Elias's single line ("You're not supposed to be here") is spare and apt. Minor register drift: "seraphically mundane" and "unpardonable silence" read as elevated authorial diction rather than Elias's lexicon, and the phrase "the color of a bruise just before it fades" is precise but slightly decorative in a peak beat. Perceptual signature is present but generic—touches, vibrations, cold—without idiosyncratic bias. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV through Veythas is stable and apt; perceptual signature is clear ("the sound like shifting sand," "a breath that tasted of dust and old promises"). Diction is elevated and controlled, fitting the mythic register without drifting into anachronism. Dialogue is minimal—the pretender's single line carries subtext and relief. The phrase "regally unpretentious bearing the quiet authority of one who had watched empires crumble without comment" is a strong character note but edges toward expository summary rather than dramatized observation. Narrative certainty stays within Veythas's knowledge, and the psychic distance tightens effectively at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lena throughout, with perceptual signature grounded in her occupational world (sonar, depth readings, dock increments). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "bioluminescent plankton," "silent accusation," "warm hull." Voss's single line of dialogue ("You've been running diagnostics again") feels natural and advances the beat. No head-hopping; distance modulates purposefully when the grandmother's memory surfaces and when the stones hum. Rhythm tightens at closure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices "dust motes swirling in slanted light," "skeletal remains of engines," and feels vibration "in the soles of her feet" before hearing it. POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates purposefully (close during stone contact, wider during collective ignition). The scout's brief dialogue ("It's not over") is functional but minimal. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the moment's urgency ("a yawn in the margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity") without clear voice motivation, creating minor register drift under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent—sensory specificity (steam curling, symbols "veins of light"), embodied perception (Liora's hands as gardener tools), and free-indirect intimacy with her stance anchor the narration. Psychic distance remains stable. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("*No. We were just loud enough to hear*"). However, elder dialogue ("*You've doomed us*") and grandson's shift lack individual idiom; both sound generically oppositional then compliant. The whisper-vines' direct instruction ("*Speak the name of what grows*") risks helpful-narrator syndrome, though it coheres with the telepathy premise.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited, tight to Lena's perceptual signature: "the scent of something alive," "the quiet talent of meeting it without flinching." Diction matches her grief-sharpened attention—"fibrous with creases," "oils perfumed the air, citrus and resin"—and remains stable under pressure. The therapist's voice briefly intrudes ("embodied pause") but is filtered as recalled instruction rather than narratorial gloss. Psychic distance contracts during peak beats (the photograph release, the leaf pluck) and opens for reflective context (the arboretum's persistence). No head-hopping; the tour group's voices are external, their misrecognition observed. Rhythm modulates effectively from the long opening sentence to the clipped final beats. Minor slip: "the stubborn persistence of life" edges toward abstraction in a high-pressure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with vivid metaphor ("its beam a flicker of memory," "the kind of scent that clung to the back of the throat"). However, under peak pressure the voice becomes abstract and over-elevated ("luminescent ache," "part of the unmaking"), losing embodied texture. Psychic distance wavers between close interiority and omniscient narration ("the library's hunger," "the sky was a bruise"), and no dialogue appears to test subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a distinct texture: "serene anger, the kind that didn't shout but carved rivers through stone." The thief's dialogue ("You're too late") pursues evasion, and the syrupy slowness reflects the time-bending pressure. Perceptual signature is present: Kael notices cracks, patterns, and the hum of stretched time. No head-hopping. The phrase "consciously wild" is told rather than embodied, but the surrounding narration maintains focus and rhythm through the confrontation and crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction carries literary ambition ("cathedral of secrets," "ghost against the console") and modulates under pressure with shorter syntax during the climax. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elara's "No. I've just remembered" pursues defiance with subtext. Minor register drift: "scandalized the stillness" and "bravely conflicted" feel elevated beyond her crisis lexicon, and the Overseer's "sedition" line reads slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Liora's sensory bias (thorns, taste, vibration). Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices roots, stitching, the roses' breathing—and diction remains consistent (concrete, slightly elevated but never clinical). Free indirect style is clean: "You were supposed to leave" registers as memory without filter clutter. Minor deduction: a few stock constructions under pressure ("the world burned," "the scream of dust") slightly flatten rhythm, and one line—"things that refused to break"—edges toward generic assertion rather than her specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited remains tightly controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: the fisher notices frequencies, gaps in sound, soil vibration. Diction is purposefully compressed and rhythmically varied ("cool-headed even when the sky bled frequencies," "absence of sound become a question"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the goddess encounter and opening slightly at the reflective dock beat. A few lines approach ornamental lyricism—"wet silk," "sleepy giants"—but these remain voice-motivated and do not obscure action. Minor filter-verb density in one passage ("He'd seen it before... patterns break themselves") slightly dulls immediacy but does not pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Lydia's perceptual bias (patterns, orbits, acoustics). Diction is elevated but consistent with her observational stance, and the prose modulates under pressure (short sentences when she finds the ledger entry, longer when reflecting). Minor slip: "devotedly observant" and the orbit metaphor are stated rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices early on. The caretaker's dialogue is spare and functional, distinct from Lydia's interior register. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices constellations, scars, firmware static, amber warmth. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("meteor burning itself out," "ledger," "dissonance"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during tactile moments, slightly distant during lyric passages). Minor register drift: "firmware roots burrowing deeper into the cracks of her mind" and "cognitive smoothness" terms edge toward over-articulation for peak stress. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Lior's artist-filter: "grains cool and deliberate," "chalk and sands." Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("coiled," "slotted," "spilling") without register drift. The flake's voice is formatted clearly as direct address. Some filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "appeared to") slightly dull immediacy in early beats, but purposeful compression in the closure sequence ("walked," "knelt," "began") accelerates rhythm without losing specificity. Perceptual signature (noticing the baker's shaking hands, blacksmith's cracked laughter) is character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elias; psychic distance is controlled and stable. Diction is elevated but consistent ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant," "heretic's compassion"), though some phrases border on purple without quite crossing ("smoke curled like a dying prayer," "voice rising like incense"). Dialogue is sparse and functional; the commander's line "They'll kill you for this" and Elias's reply carry subtext and advance pressure. Filter verbs ("He recognized," "He had learned") are few and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is clear: Elias notices cracks, patterns, and the bodies/names of the dead. Brief compression under peak stress (commander's arrival) does not muddle the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Lydia with stable psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture ("her voice was the sound of a record spinning backward") and perceptual signature (synesthetic coloring of every sensory moment). The register remains consistent and elevated without corporate drift; purposeful compression ("mid-bow, mid-note, mid-*breath*") accelerates at peak beats. Elias's minimal interiority when focus shifts to him ("Elias exhaled, sharp") is handled cleanly without head-hopping; his dialogue is sparse and goal-free, which fits his passivity but limits voice distinction. No dialogue feels forced or expository; the exchange is minimal and imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Lena's artist sensibility ("light-painted constellations," "veins of light"). Voice carries distinct texture in diction and rhythm, though some constructions drift toward elevated register ("affectionate skeptic," "somatic knowledge") that edges past Lena's established idiom under peak stress. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, tightening at key moments ("The walls breathed"). Mira's voice as "texture" rather than sound is a purposeful choice that maintains POV integrity while allowing telepathic contact, though the mechanic risks slight filter-verb stack ("came," "was") in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Narrative distance is consistent, filtering cave details through Lior's priorities (fossil veins, heat-map readouts). Voice carries a distinct lyric-technical register ("factually mystical," "topographic map of grief") that feels purposeful. No dialogue appears. Brief template cadence in the final third ("The stasis pods could keep their silence. / The world was waking up.") flattens rhythm slightly, and the closing lines shift into slightly elevated diction ("each drop hitting the sand with the weight of a promise").

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "deliberate quiet of a man who knew time was both his tool and his burden," "the wind carried voices that had never belonged to the living." Focalization remains stable, and the lexicon (fossilized resin, traveler's gasped prophecy, "drowned god") suits the fabulist register. The jar's echo "slithered free" and the button with a face "lips parted as if to scream" carry purposeful compression. Minor slips: "He believed, quietly inspired" tells the attribute rather than showing it through micro-choices, and the final paragraph's summary ("Dawn would find him in the warehouse") deflates the moment slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly controlled; Lena's perceptual signature (attention to frost, scars, coded messages) is character-specific. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("They're not asking you to come back...They're asking you to finish it"). Diction remains within Lena's lexicon (burned spy, regulation black, vouchsafe) without register drift. Purposeful compression ("A burned spy doesn't forget how to hide") and rhythm modulation under pressure enhance voice. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady on the coachman; psychic distance tightens during the fog-lifts and at the needle handoff. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "percolated," "palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity" all fit a measured, slightly archaic register. The girl's single line of dialogue—"Wait" and "For the next one"—carries goal and subtext without exposition. Minor slip: "his *closely attentive* gaze" and "*ambient awareness*" read as imposed prompt language rather than fully naturalized perception, creating a small register bump in two peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature (the potter notices thrum, light bending, honey scent). Diction is elevated and lyric, occasionally drifting into poetic abstraction ("his mind unspooled the fractured timelines like thread") that feels slightly external to a working potter's idiom. No dialogue is present. The prose has distinct texture and rhythm, though some figurative language in high-density passages (glaze "shimmering like the last breath of a dying star") tilts toward ornament. The perceptual filter remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "moonlight silvering the water like a blade left too long in the rain," "fractured stars," the harbor's "quivering hush." Elias's dialogue ("Plants like water") and brief action carry subtext without explanation. Diction is consistent—lyric, compressed, but legible—and the psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during Lena's blood offering, pulling back slightly for Elias's arrival). One micro slip: "quivering hush" as both external and internal sensation is elegant but risks slight opacity on first pass.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a distinct scholarly filter: "vestigial wings," "atomically reflective," "brittle awakening." Interiority is voiced through questions to the bird and perceptual bias (books pulsing with cloud rhythm). Free indirect style is clean. Brief diction elevation ("the slow unraveling of solitude into something sharper") fits the erudite focalizer, though peak-beat phrasing occasionally tilts toward prompt language ("translate isolation into independence"). Rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Liora's perceptual filter (ghostwriter idiom, attention to letters and twigs) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the artist's *"You've brought a secret"* and *"Nothing is. That's why we return them"* carry subtext and advance the plot without exposition. The monk's aphoristic lines risk sounding like authorial voice, but they remain in character for a temple monk. Psychic distance is controlled, though the dream sequence briefly loosens focalization. No head-hopping or tense drift; voice is clean and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance modulating cleanly (tight during transmission beats, wider for context). Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices frequencies, patterns, academic politics filtered through her exile. Diction remains within her register ("celestial signal interpreter," "cosmic chatter," "dare"). The grad student's brief dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Minor issue: "the air still thrummed with something unspoken" is slightly abstract for the established concrete voice, and "laughter, or something like it" hedges where a more definite choice would sharpen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent: elevated, baroque diction ("fallow period," "transfixing," "mutiny of space") suits the neo-Gothic atmosphere. Psychic distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices the compass's bruise-point, the organ's chain-drag notes). Peak-stress compression works ("The organ screamed. The walls shifted."). Filter verbs ("felt the cold bite") are voice-motivated. Syntax varies purposefully, though some constructions ("the reverberation of a church organ, played by no living hands") edge toward decorative in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias's perceptual signature: texture, sound, resonance, emotional weight rather than visual detail. Narrative distance is stable; interiority is filtered through sensory compensation and professional ritual. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing ("furrowing hush," "coax the past into the present") drifts from the established voice. The single line of dialogue—"You were looking for something"—feels purposeful and subdued. Some filter verbs ("knew," "wondered") are acceptable given the contemplative mode, but a few moments ("his methodical heart a little less still") edge toward poetic abstraction that doesn't fully align with the established sensory concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (brass goggles fogging, "the *knowing*") is consistent. Diction fits his librarian/scholar register. Liora's brief dialogue ("People don't just *step sideways*, Vey") carries subtext and advances plot. However, the journal's verses and Orin's final log entry are narrated rather than shown in Elias's handling, flattening immediacy. Under peak stress (glass shattering, pressure slam), syntax compresses appropriately but "curled beside the shattered window" externally narrates rather than inhabiting the POV's disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during glass examination, pulling back for the step-through). The prose has a distinct lyric texture ("sieved through a mesh of impossible angles," "luminous, disbelieving dawn"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that risks ornament over voice ("dynamically observant," "scaffold wrap flutters" as a method feels more authorial than Elias's idiom). No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is consistent (musician's ear, builder of songs), though some phrases read as external poeticizing rather than his internal music.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent ("damp wood and old greasepaint," "highway—always moving, never arriving"). Diction stays within Elias's idiom (philosophy-inflected but grounded) and modulates with pressure. Two slips prevent higher score: "perceptively calm" (line 9) and "dusky harmony" (line 16) feel authorial rather than character-generated, and "Maybe the point wasn't…" / "Maybe it was…" in the final third reads as helpful-narrator meta-commentary rather than strict POV thought. No dialogue present; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third-person with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"ink-stained fingers," "each star a wound, each story a balm." Diction is controlled and often lyric ("words unspooling like a sigh"), fitting the chronicler's idiom. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "shared burden" glyphs and the "lattice of light" occasionally read as concept-label rather than embodied perception. No head-hopping. The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (short breaths, pages flipping violently) and the final line ("Some burdens were meant to bloom") feels earned within the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Eldrin; perceptual signature is consistent (dark, tactical, weary). Distance control is strong, and the prose rhythm modulates under pressure (short beats when the plant strikes, longer reflective turns at the end). The italicized lake voice (*"You found me"*) and the brother-beast's dialogue feel distinct. However, the parenthetical asides in the final third—"(And if the water began to swirl...)" and "(He pretended not to hear.)"—read as authorial commentary rather than Eldrin's interior voice, creating brief distance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with a lyric, heightened register that suits the visionary protagonist. Perceptual signature is consistent (scars burning, dreams clawing, shadows rooted), though the diction occasionally drifts into decorative elevation ("voice like wind through reeds," "eyes two crescent moons") that privileges atmosphere over specificity. Future-Liora's dialogue carries subtext but stays within the established tone. The prose modulates under pressure (short bursts during the bridge run), and no head-hopping occurs. Minor filter-verb stacks ("pressed," "reached," "stepped") in high-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy but don't break distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with psychic distance modulating purposefully (close at the stitching beat, wider at Veyra's discovery). Dialogue is minimal but functional: Veyra's warnings and Liora's responses carry goal and subtext ("I would mend *me*"). Voice is lyric and consistent—"dusky resolve," "roots twisting like veins through the ribs of the forgotten"—though elevated diction risks distancing at peak emotional beats. The orchard's voice ("*You would mend what should stay broken?*") reads as external pressure rather than head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Liora notices the card's charred edges, the needle's flash, the flower's softness. No POV leakage or unmotivated filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; narrative certainty matches what Liam can know (he infers band history from the cloth, doesn't omnisciently declare closure). Perceptual signature is specific: he notices texture, fabric era, stitching—appraiser's gaze layered with roadie nostalgia. Diction stays within his register (road dust, feedback squeal, metronome) with one purposeful elevation at closure ("unanswered question") that fits the reflective turn. Psychic distance tightens at the cloth discovery and breathes in the final drive. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor: a few lines ("Maybe purpose wasn't something…") edge toward helpful-narrator phrasing, though they remain anchored in his internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices script, sap luminosity, and the methodical press of stylus into clay. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. The wife's dialogue is natural and distinct, carrying subtext ("You're late" as both greeting and gentle reproach). Free indirect style is clean. One demerit for the spirit's departure being told in a summarizing flashback rather than dramatized, and for slight filter-verb clustering in reflective passages ("he thought," "he knew"). Purposeful compression in the climb sequence works efficiently without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Elias's perceptual signature (moon phases, tide metaphors, paradoxes as lullaby). Dialogue is sparse, formatted cleanly, and carries subtext ("Almost is a kind of arrival"). The prose texture is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression and figurative density. However, elevated diction ("fractaling," "titan-gear," "vellum inscribed with tomorrow's date") occasionally feels ornamental rather than voice-grounded, and filter verbs ("saw his own face," "felt the weight") accumulate in reflective passages without dramatized immediacy. Under peak stress (the creel shuddering, the woman's touch), sentence rhythm remains even rather than tightening, softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("resonant hush," "stitching the words into the air like embroidery") that clashes with the inspector's operational role. The shells' shifting inscriptions are inventive, but the inspector's internal voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—she observes mystical transformations without a skeptical or procedural filter one would expect from an inspector. Radio dialogue is minimal and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited holds tight to Elias's perceptual signature: chronicler detail (ink fading, water stains), proprioceptive awareness (joints protesting, boots crushing ivy), and a rhythm that compresses under pressure ("He didn't play. / Instead, he pressed his forehead..."). Diction stays consistent (stubbornness, betrayed, groaning tape) without register drift. No dialogue on the page, so no need to test voice distinction. Slight textural monotony in mid-section paragraph openings ("He'd taken," "He pressed," "He'd found"), but variety recovers in the bridge sequence. Filter verbs ("thought of," "wondered") are sparse and voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the bellows moment and the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on the dreamer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register with purposeful compression ("breath curling like ink," "velvet unspooling"), and the pattern is taught early. Perceptual signature is present—she notices the watch's warmth, the shelf labels, the page's glow—but some diction ("propagation delay," "cipher," "epistles") drifts into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound. Thewatch vision momentarily shifts to the confidence man's present without clear transition cue, though it reads as magical rather than a focalization leak. Filter verbs are sparse; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature (accidental telepathy, coffee-stain futures) colors her noticing. Diction stays within an educated, lyric register. Two frictions: the wisteria's italicized *"They will take it. They always take"* and Silas's embedded *"You're the one who hears them, aren't you?"* read cleanly, but the final *"Thank you"* from the wisteria feels slightly over-articulated for plant "thought" after earlier compression. Purposeful lyricism (e.g., "mulberry ache") is voice-consistent, though "mulberry ache" itself appears only once and feels more prompt-echo than integrated idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the tone. Perceptual signature is consistent: "the way only those who tended the dead could be, attuned to the thresholds where stillness became something else." The woman's single line of dialogue ("Tell them, it was beautiful") carries subtext and goal. Minor deduction: some filter-verb reliance ("felt the weight of her own pulse") and slightly abstract constructions ("not as illumination but as a bridge") dull immediacy in peak beats, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with Maren's perceptual signature (rough hands, fig tree wisdom, scalloped grief). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the grotto exchange, slightly wider when framing the cycle. Diction stays character-particular—"umbral," "relentless waves," "kind hand of a clockmaker"—without register drift. The grotto's voice ("neither inside nor out") is intentional and legible. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature (lighthouse keeper's attention to beam, oil, routine) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure (close during unhooking, pulled back for the woman's arrival). The woman's dialogue ("I'm here to help you carry yours") and Elias's reply feel natural and goal-driven. Two slips: "gloriously, terribly unclear" and "sacred heaviness" drift toward elevated register during peak beats, and the final-paragraph interiority ("This is how light begins") reads slightly sermonic rather than filtered through Elias's working idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (tree-rooted metaphors, sensory acuity). Diction stays within an elevated, meditative register appropriate to the character. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") appear frequently but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in this reflective mode. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. The heavy reflection load (~30%) is anchored to the trance stimulus and does not head-hop, though extended memory sequences occasionally drift from present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as sensing, wind and echoes personified). Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("bruised twilight," "historically reverent") that fits the mythic frame. However, runs of similar syntactic stems appear ("The skimmer [verb]" x5, "He [verb]" clusters) and some figurative language borders on stock ("hunger," "pulse," "echo" recur without fresh inflection). The final paragraph's repeated declaratives ("He was the stone. He was the echo.") read as intentional incantation but flatten momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marlin; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the climb, stepped back for the keeper's dialogue). Perceptual signature is consistent—Marlin notices lingering light, veins of gold, meanings in frost. Dialogue feels functional but not deeply individuated; the keeper's dry tone ("You're late") and Marlin's spare responses serve the scene without strong subtext. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "Of course" after mist-walking reads like authorial commentary rather than Marlin's lived reaction. Diction remains within register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through Elias's lamplighter idiom and synaesthetic obsession. The prose carries a consistent lyric texture—"boots left no prints on the salt-crusted deck," "lantern swinging like a metronome," "beam cutting through dust motes like a blade through veil after veil of half-truths"—that suits the atmospheric, Accumulative lens. The figure's silent signing is a strong formal choice that enacts the "luminous vows are shown" theme. However, several figurative constructions drift into elevated register ("cobalt despair, amber longing," "a chorus of creaking timber and sighing metal… vibrating in his bones with hues he almost recognized") that feel slightly exterior to a working lamplighter's vocabulary, especially under stress. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the door, wider at the festival), and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Liora's perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, tuning to frequencies "only she claimed to hear") is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the cosmic scale, though under peak stress (the dissolution) the voice remains ornate rather than compressing. No head-hopping. The phrase "the prophecy had never been about the future" and "the choice to turn around" verge on expository summary but remain within the narrator's reflective mode. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (static, hum, wavelength) are taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the reaper; perceptual signature is distinct (grief as texture, fears as physical objects). Diction is controlled and consistent: "formless dreads of the dying, the ones that slipped through their ribs like eels" shows character-specific noticing. However, several constructions drift into elevated register during peak beats: "aftertone of a struck bell," "depthless black beneath the keel," "foam-born, the one who drowns you in your own breath" read more literary than the reaper's established internal voice. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose reflects the reaper's wearied detachment. No head-hopping. The final paragraph's syntactic rhythm ("The stars watched. / The monsters waited.") modulates effectively under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent perceptual signature (noticing drip timing, listening for silence). Diction is mostly controlled but slips into elevated register at peaks: "slithered into the air," "gasp" for a fish's emergence. The line "heart lighter than the air" reads generic. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during bell strikes and widening during reflection. Filter verbs ("watching," "thought") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, third-person close, with stable distance and a perceptual signature: "the weight of photographs…pressing like a confession," "reservoir at dusk…the hue of a held breath," "ashes swirling into the shape of hands." Diction is consistent—formal, layered—and the compression ("blue moon," "cave walls of his childhood") fits voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during photograph handling, pulls back slightly for the vision of Old Hollow. No head-hopping. Minor deduction: "precise, humane, a perfume of what had been loved and lost" in the liqueur-release beat stacks three abstract modifiers without concrete anchoring, risking elevated register drift. The line "He didn't need to drown the past. He needed to let it breathe" reads slightly thesis-like but remains within the narrator's reflective mode and doesn't flatten the image that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and lyric, with a perceptual signature that privileges metaphor and sensation ("glass bells ringing backward through time," "air tasted of ozone and possibility"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Weakness: diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("harmonizing of logic and intuition," "quiet, stubborn truth") that slightly dilutes immediacy. The prose texture is distinctive, but the narrator's way of noticing stays uniform across crisis and calm, missing an opportunity to compress or sharpen syntax under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices grooves, patterns, pressure points. Diction remains character-specific with controlled elevation: "lattice of pressure points," "ghost of a choice well-made." Psychic distance tightens during the descent without head-hopping. The whispered lesson and radio silence carry subtext. Minor deduction: "midnight pattern seeker" and "the watcher's burden" edge toward label-speak rather than fully embodied idiom. Rhythm modulates purposefully from reflective pacing in the arbor to compressed action during descent.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Kael with clear focalization and distinct perceptual texture ("ghost wearing skin," "crushing, glorious *all*"). Dialogue is spare but goal-driven, and Veyra's voice carries subtext ("You idiot" voiced with thick emotion). However, peak-beat diction occasionally inflates ("slicing through the pretense like a honed blade," "the sound raw and full") in ways that feel slightly writerly rather than filtered through Kael's crisis state. No head-hopping or filter clutter, and the final exchange lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tunnel ritual, slight withdrawal at the end). Diction is controlled: "macerated the silence," "mournfully eager," "pull cord handle glinting in the dim light" create a distinct texture. Filter verbs ("wondered," "decided") appear but feel voice-motivated. Elias's perceptual signature (the acoustics, the hourglass's fingerprints, the wind's half-sung lullabies) is consistent. Minor voice convergence: the child's joke and the family's laughter are told rather than shown, flattening their distinctness, but the effect serves economy at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight sensory signature: "teeth ached," "hungry cold," "sound of a page turning in an empty room." The figure's dialogue carries subtext (ownership, fear). Psychic distance modulates smoothly—closer during the hand-over, receding into the dissolution. One brief register wobble: "stretched between" and "unfolding from it" lean slightly ornamental but remain within the lyric mode the piece teaches early.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"frozen bloom," "liquid" air—and the narrative voice carries texture. Dialogue at the end is brief but goal-driven. However, register drifts into elevated phrasing under pressure: "successive approximation toward something alive," "vivify," and especially "stoically sensitive" feel imposed rather than character-filtered. The phrase "stoic sensitivity" in the climax reads as external narration rather than Elias's lived perceptual signature, weakening distance control at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is distinct and lyric ("shard of hush," "serenely electric"), with purposeful compression and metaphoric density. POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("the sound of the universe listening to itself") occasionally drifts from the concrete perceptual frame, and peak beats favor abstraction over embodied perception. The final paragraph's register ("stupid, beautiful truth") shifts toward meta-commentary without full grounding in Elara's idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent and texture-specific: "Course is relative, Cap. You know the rules when clocks run sideways" and "Right where I'm supposed to be" establish Lira's unflappable idiom. POV distance holds steady; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit (Lira's grin and evasion, the ghost's thin-voiced question). The prose modulates under pressure (short bursts during the merge: "Hold on, folks") and the perceptual signature (frayed rope, oil-stained vest, starflower plucked from air) remains selective and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout; Elias's perceptual signature (measured, philosophical, attuned to texture and memory) is consistent. Distance modulates purposefully—close during the threading act, pulling back slightly for the eruption. The woman's dialogue ("You're late," "Beautiful," "Again?") is spare and functional, carrying subtext without over-articulation. Minor issue: Elias's interior diction remains elevated and literary even under pressure ("rational enchantment," "collective exhalation"), where stress might compress or fragment syntax; the prose never degrades under emotional load, reducing the sense of embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elira as focalizer; no head-hopping occurs. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register—"benthic city," "somber marvel," "unfolded horizons"—that suits the speculative setting but occasionally drifts into abstract declaration: "the universe was vast, and humanity had been navigating it blind." Dialogue between Elira and Kael is functional and goal-driven, with subtext in Kael's skepticism and Elira's patient redirection. However, perceptual signature remains somewhat generic; Elira's noticing doesn't carry character-specific bias or texture. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("realized," "wanted") appear frequently without disrupting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV holds steadily; Elias's perceptual signature (listening closely, fragile heartbeats, static as message) is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction remains consistent ("pennies left on a corpse's eyes," "spider silk") with purposeful compression ("The dead didn't speak. They *lingered.*"). However, brief moments of expository interiority ("He wasn't a hero. He was a man who listened too closely") explain rather than dramatize, and the supervisors/ex framing feels like scaffolding. Italicized voice ("Find her before the mist does") is handled cleanly, and psychic distance shifts intentionally to match emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is clean and maintains psychic distance. The perceptual signature leans heavily on lyric compression ("crashing hush," "the weight of the earth above him was a living thing") that reads as elevated rather than character-specific idiom. Diction is consistent but occasionally drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("drowning light," "the world, unaware, turned above them both") that feels authored rather than inhabited. Purposeful repetition ("The tide returned. The cables slept.") creates cadence, but the fragments sometimes prioritize rhythm over propulsion, flattening momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Lena's perceptual filter (porcelain shard, pulse-counting, ink patterns) is consistent. The voice carries a lyric, contemplative rhythm that modulates with the static's arrival. However, some diction edges into elevated register ("ephemeral swirls," "chorus," "vast and unknowable") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. No head-hopping; distance control is clean. The "digital ghost" voice is distinct from narration, but its lines ("You count them, don't you?") border on thematic ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Veyra, with distinct perceptual signature (copper-veined, texture-into-sound sensibility). Voice modulates under pressure ("warm as a heartbeat," "thick as chains"), and no head-hopping occurs. However, several peak beats rely on filter verbs ("understood too late," "knew the method") that dull immediacy, and the final third includes some redundant stems ("The canyon breathes. The storyteller does not. But the starlings keep flying.") that flatten rhythm slightly without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance, and voice carries a distinct rhythm (gravitationally playful diction, fragment-heavy syntax). Filter verbs ("felt the harmony," "heard the phone's final confession") cluster in peak beats without dramatizing the sensations, and the prose shifts into elevated, workshop-lyric register ("frostbitten and hopeful all at once," "roots and static") that clashes with Elias's bitter-researcher idiom established early. The herbalist's dialogue reads as thematic echo rather than character-specific speech, and the phone-voice convergence with Elias's own lacks perceptual signature—no cue that he registers the uncanniness of hearing himself.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to the violinist's perceptual signature (she notices the locust shell pulsing in time with her heartbeat, the weight of wings on the bridge). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("sigh that carried the scent of rain," "transparent wings catching the light like shattered stained glass") without register drift. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (repeated "Somewhere" transitions, parallel structure in the orchard's transformation) teach a rhythm that supports the Accumulative lens. Filter verbs are minimal. The voice is distinct and serves the material without obscuring clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elias; distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (notice of drone rhythm, scar, postal cap weight). Diction is largely controlled, though phrases like "a thunderstorm in a bottle" and "brittle hush" risk lyricism over embodied perception. Dialogue feels natural ("You're late," "Respectfully rebellious") with subtext in Lira's "That's not mail" and Elias's hedged answer. One slip: "the moment before an apology" reads as narrator's metaphor rather than Elias's in-scene thought. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates (short bursts during drone approach, longer breath at post office) and vocabulary stays within a postal-worker-turned-smuggler's lexicon without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Lior's perceptual signature: tactile focus (warped wood, jagged metal edges), aural selectivity (creak, sigh, melody), minimal speech. Diction remains consistent—"sliver of metal, cold and light" and "sawdust and rust" feel character-particular. The woman's dialogue ("You're late," "The train doesn't forget") reads purposeful and distinct. Minor slip: "persistent" appears as both narrator label and implied trait without Lior demonstrating persistence through a visible micro-choice under friction before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable with a consistent perceptual signature: Elias notices through a lens of geometry and his mother's incantations ("the silences his mother had called 'the real poetry'"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dust motes in slanted light," "liquid amber," "a riot of fractal vines"). Dr. Voss's brief dialogue carries distinct idiom. Under peak stress (the ritual), the prose compresses appropriately without losing texture, and the final paragraph modulates to reflective calm that charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled figurative density ("spine of a runaway dream," "cipher of longing"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third, filtering sensory detail through the librarian's artistic lens. However, peak-pressure moments lean on elevated diction ("luminous absence between dawn and memory") that occasionally drifts from immediate perception into thematic summary. The dream's whispered dialogue ("You found me," "Take me back") serves plot function but lacks subtext or resistance, reading more as mystical cue than character exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable focal distance; the locksmith's perceptual signature ("her fingers already knew the weight of it") is distinct and embodied. The man's dialogue ("It's a prison," "You were supposed to free *her*") carries goal-driven subtext and forces the protagonist's clarification. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate at peak pressure ("She followed the hint, not with her hands but with her memory"), wider for cosmic possibility. Diction remains voice-consistent ("moth-eaten coat," "rough as unplaned wood") with no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and precise, filtering all detail through Elias's folklorist lens (fairy ring as key, residue as detector, old texts as reference). Diction is controlled and distinct ("drowned leviathan," "hollowed out like a gourd," "waves dragging over glass"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during memory surges, pulled back for the pedestal discovery. The memory eater's single line of dialogue carries subtext and goal (dismissal, familiarity), and Elias's reply mirrors the structure without feeling templated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature (mythologist's attention to residue, constellation maps, old words) is consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elspeth's perceptual signature is distinct: "counting the ribs of a sleeping beast," "the kind of quiet that makes people lean in." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext ("lies are where the interesting truths hide") and advances plot without exposition. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the combative tenderness of it was the point" edges toward meta-commentary but recovers quickly. Diction remains within POV's lexicon (archivist's technical idiom). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short beats during the shadow's lunge).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature shows in "every cut was a conversation," "capturing essence... in the curve of a branch," and the pruning knife "humming against his thigh." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the veil crossing, pulling back for the villagers' consumption), yet diction slips into elevated register at peaks—"insatiable craving to shape the unseen," "the quiet, radiant hush of what might grow"—that reads more authorial than the calloused pruner's lexicon. The girl's dialogue ("They fade here") carries naturalism, but her voice and Elias's converge in the closing whisper-language metaphor without distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable (close third on Elias), and the perceptual signature is selective and craft-specific: he notices knots, silk patience, the needle's worn eye, frayed edges. Voice modulates purposefully—compressed, lyric sentences during the unraveling ("The knot unraveled itself"), longer, image-dense lines during setup. The woman's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("You won't hold them"). Minor slips: "interlaced hush" and "singing pressure" edge toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon, and the phrase "accumulated silence, drawing it from the air like mist" risks abstraction in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the kind [of silence] that hummed in the gaps between drips," "tools of a map framer who measured the world...in quiet spaces." Diction—"methodically curious," "not mistakes but choices"—fits Elara's professional idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening when she leans into the projection and exhaling when she steps into rain. One minor slip: "the shape of it—the echo of a door swinging open on hinges no one had oiled in centuries" momentarily drifts into elevated metaphor that strains against the practical framing established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; Liora's perceptual signature is analytic and image-driven ("noted the way," "traced the desk's grain"). Diction stays controlled and voice-motivated, modulating appropriately from clinical observation to lyric compression at closure. No head-hopping. The prose rhythm tightens under pressure (short declaratives: "It was wrong. ... She didn't startle.") and breathes in reflective beats. Psychic distance narrows purposefully at key moments (forehead pressed to globe, notebook against ribs). Minor penalty for occasional filter-verb stacks ("she noted," "she thought") that slightly dull immediacy in a few mid-passage beats, and for the phrase "the physics of letting go" appearing twice, which risks becoming a catchphrase rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; the balladeer's perceptual signature—"driftingly alert," noticing ozone and old parchment, hearing static hum—is distinct and selective. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure: short, decisive beats at the climax ("He exhaled, slow and deliberate, and pressed harder"), longer accumulative lines in reflection. One friction: "a ghost *in code*, a fragment of something vast and hungry" and "the curse of the seldom-heard" carry slight expository tilt, naming concepts the scene already enacts. Psychic distance remains close and voice-consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: "mysteries the way others unfolded maps," "sky's indifference," "forgotten dreams." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at diary discovery, pulled back at observatory). Some diction elevates beyond strict character lexicon ("parapets," "ozone," "inextricable") but remains voice-consistent and legible. Rhythm varies under pressure: short declarative "She did" and "Cold air rushed in" contrast with earlier lyrical compound sentences. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a perceptual signature (clouds as emotion, grief as atmospheric phenomenon) and controlled rhythm. Diction remains within the focalizer's poetic lexicon; no head-hopping. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract elevation ("quiet explosions," "dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness") without grounding in micro-choices under stress, and the father's bourbon-fueled phrase feels convenient rather than earned. Psychic distance is stable, and the single-POV frame is clean. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and image-driven ("river of gold fracturing," "pillow damp with sap"), with purposeful compression in the glass-ceiling construction. Voice modulates under pressure: terse action during the build, lyric expansion in the dream and morning beats. The post-collapse sequence risks over-lyricism ("the hush before demolition," "the sky wrote itself"), yet the final lines sustain texture without obscuring closure. Psychic distance widens slightly in the coda (multiple paragraph-long reflections), but the artist's perceptual signature—touch, craft, pursuit—remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices patterns (warped charts, faint glow, cloud curls "like ink on old parchment"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("You're supposed to be plotting our descent, not playing in the dust"). One friction: the captain's tag "snapped" followed by immediate capitulation to Liora's theory compresses what should be a longer negotiation, flattening Veyra's voice under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within Liora's observant, curious register.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through the locksmith's craft-driven perception. Diction is purposeful: "breath curled like old ink," "gummed with something darker than rust." Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices mechanisms, spiral stairs, gear teeth—though under peak stress the voice becomes slightly elevated ("the shape of time's absence") rather than compressing. The child's lips forming words without sound and the mirror dissolving "into ripples, into light, into the *click*" demonstrate rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb stacks ("she'd found," "she'd thought") that dull immediacy in reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Liora notices cracks, hums, shadows—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unspooled their sorrows," "collective exhale," "brambled hope" aesthetic) that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Kael's italicized dialogue is clean and carries subtext, but his voice lacks distinct idiom; the mechanic, child, and refugees remain offstage, so no secondary-voice test applies. Free indirect style is consistent, and the prose modulates with scene intensity, yet the final paragraphs shift into declarative summary ("This was the nebula") that flattens the earned perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric register—"time frayed," "the pane of hush," "the lighthouse wasn't just stone and glass"—that reflects Elias's elevated interior world. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the narration's certainty occasionally exceeds what Elias can plausibly know ("the voices of the thousand lifetimes the clock had borrowed"). Diction is poetic but controlled; no register drift or filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature is consistent, if uniform in its reverence, and the final lines modulate appropriately to rest.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct: "too sharp, too precise," "graceless beauty," "its ink the color of old bruises." Perceptual signature is consistent—Liora notices routes, blind spots, gears, and weights with a caretaker's practiced precision. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the girl's arrival, pulled back during the blueprint reflection, intimate again at the final nut-placement. Minor deduction: the phrase "offhandedly exact" in the prompt is echoed verbatim on the page ("never touching the stone itself" reads as deliberate, not offhanded), and the girl's single line of dialogue ("Please") is functional but generic, lacking subtext or character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-close on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (polymer-lattice analogies, symphonic framing). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. The girl's dialogue ("Is that a butterfly's house?") feels natural for her age, and Elias's one-word reply ("Everywhere") carries subtext. Minor issue: some narration drifts toward elevated diction not fully voice-motivated ("symphonically minded brain finally hearing the music instead of dissecting it" reads slightly authorial). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though a few filter verbs ("he thought") appear where direct rendering would sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is controlled and lyric throughout, with a consistent perceptual signature ("fingers brushing," "hum like a plucked string," "chimed softly") that never slips into head-hopping or register mismatch. The patron's dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("I want the glimmering parole"); Liora's interiority stays character-particular. Distance remains stable, and the elliptical phrasing ("The incising wasn't writing; it was listening") reads purposeful rather than obscure. Minor scaffold appears in the final third (repeated "She already knew," "It was always the same"), slightly dulling the ending's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and textured: sentence rhythm modulates between lyric compression ("The rain had come and gone") and sensory thickness ("briny, the walls weeping condensation"). POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through Elias. Psychic distance tightens during the pavilion sequence ("the water was cold, then *not*, then *him*") with effective use of italics for immediacy. The apprentice's brief dialogue at the end feels natural and provides contrast. Minor slip: "None of them knowing" shifts into distant omniscient commentary for two beats mid-piece, pulling away from Elias's immediate experience, though it returns quickly. Perceptual signature (taste-driven noticing) is specific and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Liora; psychic distance is stable. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("empathetically decisive," "like a scythe through wheat") that occasionally drifts above the immediacy of the scene. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elias's lines carry subtext and pursuit. The narration's perceptual filter reflects Liora's musical sensibility (voices "lingering in her ribs"), though some phrasing feels authored rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (engineer's precision: "helix of equations," "chaotically precise"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("fractured ribs," "quantum foam," "sediment"). No head-hopping. Under peak pressure ("knees hit the ground"), diction compresses slightly without losing texture. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (close on "her pulse spiked," then pulls back for the canyon's inhalation). No dialogue on the page, so those bullets do not apply. Minor register drift: "synaptic plasticity" and "quantum foam" feel slightly elevated for a crisis moment, but voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "prism-mind," "clandestinely luminous," "the air ripped—not like fabric, but like a held note." Diction is elevated and consistent, though stock poetic turns ("shadows that moved before she did," "the mist swallowed her scream") dilute voice specificity under peak pressure. No head-hopping or filter excess. Dialogue is absent. Distance control is clean, and the reflective beats (seventeen years of work, the brother's departure) anchor in present stimuli without flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and Elias's perceptual signature is distinct: he hears vibrations as music, reads stress as melody. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("not music, not yet—but it was *almost* a song"). Minor slip: "Empathy in motion. / That was the core of it" briefly shifts into meta-commentary, a slight flattening of the otherwise embodied texture, though it recovers quickly and the closure image holds voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds Elias's perceptual signature throughout: chess metaphors, tactile focus on the stone, deliberate pacing. Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue carries subtext—"You're afraid" / "Not of losing. Of playing at all"—and advances the thematic question. Two weaknesses lower the score: the girl's speech lacks child idiom ("my grandfather said the nexus remembers") and reads as authorial exposition, and several beats lean on filter verbs ("he recognized," "he realized") where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure but doesn't fully embody the tutor's voice under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout; Elias's perceptual signature—silence as texture, vibrations as language—is distinct and consistent. Diction stays within his register: "a language of pauses," "frequency of words," "air between them shivered." The woman's silence at the end is dramatized action rather than exposition. Minor template cadence in a few descriptive beats ("The workshop filled with the sound of careful hands") but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters through Liora's olfactory sensitivity: "rotting honey, buried secrets," lavender grief, fig deceit. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the planting and bloom. Diction is largely voice-consistent, though phrases like "the turning tide's thought" and "the wildflower hush of a village breathing" elevate register slightly beyond strict character lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the eldest's "You sought wisdom" carries subtext. The prose reflects Liora's herbalist mind through precise plant and scent language. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent distance and a clear perceptual signature—Veyra notices glider mechanics, moss pulse, and the upward river through a pilot's trained attention. Diction is mostly controlled, though stock adventure phrases ("breath hitched," "grinned," "smiled") and italicized emphasis (*accelerated*, *creation*, *instructions*, *grew*, *singing*) inflate emotional beats that the prose has already earned, signaling authorial anxiety rather than voice confidence. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully through the inversion sequence, and the "whirling silence" motif recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final beat despite the occasional tic.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable throughout; Veyra's perceptual signature (engineering precision layered with traumatic vigilance) is consistent and particular. Diction modulates appropriately under stress—short, urgent syntax during the chase, measured reflection in the office coda. The flight engineer backstory integrates cleanly via the patch anchor. Free indirect style is controlled, and the few gestural beats (exhaling, boot catching) serve pressure rather than clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and perceptual signature is clear: synesthesia colors dominate every beat. Diction is elevated and lyric ("prism-song," "fractals of emerald and cobalt," "bridges of light"), consistent with the focalizer's synesthetic lens. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction—"certify wonder as essential," "oscillating repose"—that reads more like thematic summary than Liora's internal idiom. The prose rhythm supports the accumulative design, but some figurative density in high-pressure beats (third chime, final image) risks self-consciousness without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable psychic distance. Diction is controlled and distinct ("avalanchingly quiet," "unspooled his defenses," "the hush—the moments when the world seemed to lean in"), creating textural signature. The child's one line of dialogue feels purposeful and goal-driven. Narration stays within Elias's plausible knowledge except one brief slip: "When the next keeper found this place, they would see only the markers"—a forward leap in certainty that momentarily breaches POV modesty. Reflection dominates the middle third, anchored to present stimuli (flute, driftwood, child's laughter) but occasionally abstracts into summary ("The guardianship had taught him…") rather than staying embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "stars vanished like breath on glass," "wet silk," "topaz dust rained." The prose modulates effectively under pressure—short declaratives accelerate in the final third. However, at the climax, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("lucid turbulence," "transposed empathy, raw and unfiltered") that reads more thematic than character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in third limited, but the narrative distance fluctuates between tight sensory immediacy ("His breath hitched") and distant summary ("By sunrise, the courier would be gone"). Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a "jittery" courier's interior lexicon: "sympathetically," "germinate into wonders," "choosing to become the hum itself." The woman's single line of dialogue ("You think wonder's something you *coax*?") carries subtext, but her subsequent exposition dumps mechanics without goal-driven indirection. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—aurora and abyss are described identically throughout despite escalating emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices silence in degrees, weight of breaths, emotional residue in objects. Voice remains character-specific under pressure with strong rhythm control ("There—anger, sharp and metallic"). The prism's focalization tightens appropriately as stakes rise. Minor deduction for slight register drift in phrases like "commune was to listen with more than ears" where diction elevates beyond the mystic's established lexicon during a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose establishes a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("raveling silence," "the shape of sound," "distance"). POV remains stable in the spinner's segment; the lover's section shifts cleanly at a section break with consistent third-person limited. Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated for a fable-like register. One weakness: "tree sap amber" is redundant (amber *is* fossilized resin), and "stoically sparkling" strains coherence—stoicism is a stance, not a visual quality. These minor register slips do not obscure the overall effect but reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to the smith's perception. Perceptual signature is selective: "quiet defiance," "slow-burning thing," the scent of crushed fruit and old magic. Diction is consistent and purposeful, with sentence rhythm modulating effectively (short sentences at peak beats: "The planet answered. Not with violence, but with a sigh"). One minor slip: "azure defiance" and "deliberate" recur as labels without always being embodied in specific choices. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present ("You fixed it" / "I just listened").

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with patterned diction ("cyclically spontaneous," "substructure of reality," "narratives, threads of cause and effect") that establishes Liora's perceptual signature early. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "the weight in her chest wasn't fear. / It was the thrill of the next thread" tells rather than embodies. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You weren't supposed to find that," "Took you long enough"), advancing plot without deep subtext. The prose compresses well under pressure, but the final beats lean on conceptual vocabulary that slightly flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds consistently, filtering all detail through Elias's perceptual bias (the glass as "smooth as a held breath," the stones "humming when the wind hit them right"). Voice is textured and lyric with purposeful compression ("the mist like a held note," "all teeth and salt"), and the rhythm modulates effectively—taut in the opening, expanding as communion deepens. The letters' voices are distinct from Elias's narration (terse, archival: "Adair, 1892; Mira, the one who sang"). Mild overwriting in the final third: "the silence felt like an invitation" and "the tower breathed" risk stating what the images already convey. One template-cadence run in the penultimate section ("he wrote," "he didn't know," "he blew out") slightly flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is distinct ("color that bent when you tried to name it," "shadows listened"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout pressure beats. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from Liora's implied lexicon ("accidentally prophetic," "total internal reflection" as physics term feels like author intrusion rather than her thought). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose texture reflects her stance—calm defiance tinged with glee—without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: diction choices ("the texture of crushed petals," "cautions written in light") sustain a lyric register without drift. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (sight filtered through a dye master's attention to color and light). The woman's dialogue feels slightly ornamental ("You're looking for the why") but serves subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Some elevated phrasing at peak beats ("the quiet explosion of being seen") approaches overwriting but remains voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single tight third-person POV anchored to Elias throughout; psychic distance is close and stable with his perceptual signature consistent (notices stone breathing, feels pressure as texture, interprets hums and sighs). Diction fits a solitary laborer who thinks in tactile metaphors ("moonlight pooled like liquid silver," "sorrow...like rain in a cup") without register drift. Prose rhythm modulates purposefully: longer, layered sentences during reflection ("The sextant had been dropped in frustration, or grief, or both") compress to shorter beats during physical action ("He picked up his lantern and stepped into the corridor"). The line "not stolen, not lost, but returned" uses purposeful repetition for cadence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor friction: "the sheer pressure of it" and "the quiet, stubborn act of growing despite" approach elevated diction but remain voice-coherent given Elias's contemplative role.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices mica windows, root pulses, tree behavior through her keeper expertise. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—tighter during singing, wider during memory reflection. Diction stays within character lexicon except one slip: "alchemical trees" and "mirror world" read as authorial labels rather than Liora's natural thought vocabulary. The prose carries distinct texture ("swaddle the dying realm in forgotten songs") with purposeful compression. Filter verbs appear sparingly and voice-motivated. No dialogue present to evaluate. The line "The memory keeper had become the song, and the song had become the world" risks abstraction but lands as thematic crystallization rather than explaining what's been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lena. Voice is consistent with elevated, lyric diction ("nest of contradictions," "phantom limbs"). Psychic distance is controlled. However, the prose occasionally drifts into thesis-mode abstraction ("the paradox of leaving while staying unspooled before her") that feels authorial rather than Lena-specific. The mirrors and Voss's dialogue ("You left the door unlocked") create purposeful ambiguity but border on convenient mysticism. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear but are voice-appropriate. Diction is high-literary throughout; no register breaks, but the uniformity can feel distancing rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Liora's perceptual signature ("noticed when the ordinary tilted," "heuristically gentle"). Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and purposefully elevated ("unspooling like a memory," "uncloaking its wounds"), fitting the fable-like tone. One register slip: "heuristically gentle" reads as authorial label rather than Liora's brother's plausible speech. The prince's silence at the end is voice-appropriate, but his interior remains opaque—no dialogue to test distinctness. Filter verbs ("she didn't ask," "he didn't speak") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic compression ("forgotten breath," "quartz hush," "stardust") that remains legible and consistent. Psychic distance is stable throughout; Elias's perceptual signature (meticulous, records-focused, then trembling when personal longing surfaces) is clear. Free indirect style is clean. One slip: "Find me where the light bends" is delivered as the woman's voice but carries no vocal texture or embodiment—just a disembodied directive—so the moment lacks naturalism despite its thematic importance. No dialogue mechanics issues otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lena with consistent perceptual signature (notices edges, weight, quiet). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("syrup-thick murmur," "feather on the scale"). Dialogue carries subtext and pursues goals effectively in the confrontation. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under pressure. Two slips: "curiously steadfast gaze" is told attribution rather than shown behavior, and "the exact pitch of a man realizing he'd been outplayed" over-explains what the scene dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice remains stable, layered with poetic specificity ("terrestrially cosmic," "the space between stars") that fits the lyric-philosophical register. The perceptual signature—taste as sense modality—is consistent and character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully ("*Impossible.*"). One slip: "She licked her lips" followed immediately by taste description feels slightly mechanical. No dialogue present. Diction stays within the narrator's register without unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices shadows, charcoal, and "prismatic ghosts" in character-specific ways. Distance modulates purposefully from tight interiority ("his knees hit the damp stone") to reflective summary ("the calling wasn't inescapable anymore"). No head-hopping. Minor slip: "the exact angle of his mother's wrist the day she'd left" is told memory without present anchor, but it lands briefly and primes the lock's function, so BRR allowance applies.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV (Elias) remains stable throughout. Voice is consistent and textured: "blisters under a sky choked with copper haze," "air itself had turned to brine." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the Archive sequence. One friction: the narration occasionally over-explains what the dramatization has shown ("He couldn't lie. Not even in the polite, necessary ways"), and a few filter phrases ("his throat tightened") recur without variation. The final paragraph's shift to declarative simplicity ("He didn't open it") effectively signals change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices vibration, shimmer, and the angle where "wonder still had a color." Diction is largely controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("glisten—not with melt, but with something older"). However, several lines drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "moral calculus," "Morse code of light," "consensus reality." The final paragraph's "The symphony was already written" borders on thematic ventriloquism. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong in the ice-shattering beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited to Elias with consistent distance and perceptual signature (metal fingers, auditory sensor, diaphragm hitch). Diction stays android-particular ("programming," "glitch," "reboot") while allowing poetic compression ("the desert wind hit him like a reboot"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the box discovery, broader during the burn. Minor friction: "the roses trembled" in paragraph five briefly externalizes without clear POV anchor, and "the ghost of a hand on his shoulder" edges toward metaphor that feels slightly unmoored from his sensory lexicon under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third around Mira; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, measured rhythm ("slow exhale," "mosaic of hope and grief") that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is spare, functional, and advances plot. Minor filter-verb stacks ("heard," "felt," "saw") appear but don't dull immediacy significantly. The courtyard residents' voices ("That box hasn't opened since…") carry light differentiation through idiom, though Mrs. Delgado and Old Man Chen remain largely interchangeable in function.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Lira's perceptual signature: she filters the world through cryptographic metaphor ("each step was a variable, each turn a function") and embodied sensation. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in lyric passages ("Time here didn't pass; it accumulated"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates with pressure—closer during the dance, wider during the surface ascent. One minor register drift: "the vulnerable and unbreakable parts of herself" feels slightly elevated for peak pressure, though it remains within the established lyric mode. Rhythmic control is strong, and the final shift to quieter reflection ("She let it be") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and textured—diction like "grotesque blooms," "yawning wide," and "gravity pooled like ink" creates a specific perceptual signature. POV distance is stable; the lighter's professional idiom (lanterns, brass hook, wicks) and grief-soaked attention filter all sensory detail. The phrase "her name... wasn't a voice. It was a *shape*" demonstrates strong control under peak pressure. Minor slips: "lead weight" and "thick as mud" are stock phrases that slightly flatten texture in key beats, and one filter-verb cluster ("he'd seen the truth") in the backstory block reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and rhythmically controlled ("terrestrially cosmic tension," "tranquil blaze"), yet register occasionally drifts into abstract ornament ("smoothed hush," "lattice of light") that feels imported rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is poetic but generic—adjectives could apply to any contemplative protagonist. Psychic distance remains consistent, and free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance appropriately tightens during the contract-signing beat. Diction ("ink-stained fingers," "dry as old parchment," "patient as the dead") creates a distinct, slightly archaic texture that suits the dead-language conceit. Minor register drift: "interrogating" and "renunciation" edge toward elevated abstraction in a few beats, though the context supports them. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Veyra's lines ("you've come about the seal," "agree to the lies first") carry subtext and goal pursuit. The perceptual signature—Elias's attention to building whispers, brick textures, and silhouette shapes—remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains elevated, lyric diction throughout ("tragically radiant," "the ghost of the shell's whisper still curled against her ribs") that coheres as a singular stance but occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction under pressure ("her chest was empty. Not gone. *Archived.*"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the italicized internal asides (*"You don't believe in ghosts,"* it seemed to say) blur the boundary between shell-voice and Liora's thought without clear motivation. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (the shell "pulsed," the garden "shuddered") but register stays uniformly literary rather than modulating with stress.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV anchors to the forger with consistent perceptual filtering (breath fogging marble, pooled ink, rusted laugh). Dialogue is sparse and carries subtext ("You forged my hand, but never my heart"), though the Emperor's lines and the forger's internal voice converge in elevated, poetic diction that flattens voice distinction under stress. Free indirect style is clean, but the final third includes minor filter-verb stacks ("he thought," "he understood") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("some treasons were not betrayals, but corrections") that read more like authorial commentary than the forger's lived idiom. Distance control is stable, yet the prose lacks a character-particular syntactic signature that would distinguish this narrator from others in the same register.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with narrative distance modulating appropriately (tighter during descent, broader at framing beats). Perceptual signature is present—Veyra filters setting through auditory and kinetic details—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the webs of intrigue," "richly perceptive") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Dialogue with Kaelis is sparse and functional, though his lines ("Because we're the ones who listen too well") edge toward thematic pronouncement. The prose has distinct texture in the opening and closing, but mid-scene syntax becomes more uniform during the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly bound to Lena's perceptual signature: she notices ice groans, candle pooling, the "color of old silver" in ghost voices—details filtered through practitioner expertise. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("oilskin coat," "kelp net," "timbers straining"). The widow's italicized speech distinguishes her register from narration. One slip: "the wrong ghost" and "weaves truth carefully" edge toward tell-label phrasing in a mid-beat where showing through the globe handling would tighten. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited stays stable with Kael as primary focus until the late pivot toward Liora's interiority; the shift is clean and serves closure. Diction is elevated but coherent ("scintillatingly somber," "crushed mint," "whisper against the pilings") and matches the lyric-philosophical mode taught from the opening. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext (Kael's "Because the fish see" encodes his worldview). Perceptual signature is consistent: attention to texture, pattern, and hidden mechanics. Brief filter-verb stacks ("believed in," "noticed") appear but do not dull peak moments. The voice modulates purposefully—meditative in exposition, taut in the teaching exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "cracked goggles," "fingers sticky with sap," "shredded into confetti by some overzealous censor's blade." Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("man who'd made a religion of disbelief"). The single line of dialogue (radio voice) is natural and goal-driven. However, the narration briefly exceeds Elias's plausible real-time processing during the stillpoint vision ("the caretaker…unspooling…the physicist…sealing…the Liquidation not an accident but a quarantine") without clear dramatization of how he receives this knowledge, creating a mild filter breach. Psychic distance otherwise holds.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias hears futures in static, tastes ozone, sees shadows with too many fingers). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though occasional register drift intrudes: "You are the hinge, little god. Swing wide" reads as atmospheric but stylized beyond Elias's established diction. The voice modulates effectively under pressure (short, fragmented beats during the climax), but some sentences rely on stock poetic constructions ("a jagged, hungry thing," "bruised purple of a promise"). No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. Psychic distance shifts intentionally, tightening during the transformation sequence, and tense remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "dawn's earliest whistle," "stories unspooling like silk," "positively wistful." The girl's brief dialogue feels natural and age-appropriate. Some filter verbs ("watching his breath curl") appear but remain voice-motivated. Diction occasionally elevates ("lonesome splendor") but stays within a poet-narrator's plausible register. The final paragraph's slight drift toward summary ("he'd learned that redemption...") is the only notable distance slip.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates appropriately (close during the key turn, slightly elevated in the final paragraphs). Diction is mostly character-consistent ("logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay"), but "forgiven by physics" and "fleshly" in the prompt's "fleshly ethereal" push toward elevated abstraction at peak moments. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads vibrations as "language" and feels frequencies "hum through her gloves." No dialogue. One minor register slip: "a state where logic and emotion were the same thing" feels over-articulated for someone mid-transformation. Psychic distance widens in the closing paragraphs, which serves the ethereal tone but slightly reduces embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, with Lior's perceptual signature (horizon mapper, moon-path reader) distinct. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the slow unraveling of the world's temper," "celestial unyoking") that strains the focalizer's plausible lexicon during reflective beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation (ear to strut) and lyric remove ("a bridge to nowhere and everywhere"). No head-hopping, and the reflection-heavy mode remains anchored to present stimuli (lake freeze, viaduct hum), but the density of reflective blocks (~30%) tests the upper limit even under the BRR exception, as some passages paraphrase rather than advance present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with clean focalization through Elias's professional lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: stress fractures, vibrations, grout details reflect investigator training. Prose rhythm modulates well under pressure (shorter sentences as water seeps). The walkie-talkie exchange feels natural and advances plot. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the wall discovery. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature—chaplain-watchmaker lens fusing spiritual and mechanical metaphors—is consistent. Distance control holds across reflection and action. However, several beats rely on elevated diction ("apt deliberation," "vibrant hush") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally drift from Elias's plain vocational idiom. The line "Its maker had been an inmate" reads more like exposition than thought. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Pip throughout, with distinct perceptual signature—her focus on gears, joints, frequencies, and the workshop's "vibration." Diction is compressed and idiosyncratic ("cart glider," "yearning algorithm," "transliterate herself back together") without register drift. The prose modulates with pressure: short bursts during the flight sequence ("She wasn't falling. She was *conducting*.") contrast with the more contemplative opening. Free indirect style is clean. One slip: the final paragraph's "irreverent awe was just another word for *Tuesday*" breaks voice with a colloquial meta-joke that clashes with the established lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lena's perceptions. Diction stays consistent—"ghost-light," "data graves," "recursive loop"—building a tech-haunted voice. The whispered line "I know what you're doing" and Elias' paradoxical speech through the patch maintain clarity of focalization. Brief filter-verb stack in the middle ("She pulled up… her pulse syncing… The screen dissolved") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure action. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts effectively under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric, compressed, with a perceptual signature that filters through Elias's intuitive lens ("his shadow stretching long and unnaturally still," "the weighted breath before reply"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the diction is purposeful, avoiding filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, tightening as Elias approaches his decision. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. Minor elision (the girl's identity, the exact mechanics of the mirrors) is taught early and serves the accumulative design, remaining legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is concrete ("ice pressed against eardrums," "grip on reality loose," "bones humming"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific (e.g., "trawling for meaning," "room she'd outgrown"). The laugh startles *her*, not the reader—good internal distance calibration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Purposeful compression in the time-ellipsis between cancellation and final morning maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual texture: Lior notices soil's "slow sighs," grapes as "destiny with better trajectories" filtered through Mira's voice. Free indirect style is mostly clean; "destiny with better trajectories" reads as her idiom recalled by him. One register slip: "intersubjective understanding" in the rubric expectation does not appear on the page, but "nurture understanding" is implicit rather than stated, so voice holds. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close reflection and wider scene framing. No dialogue, so that bullet is not judged.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all perception through Lysan's line-walker idiom: "peripheral awareness," "the way one senses a storm before the clouds gather." Perceptual signature is consistent (touch prioritized, smell secondary, kinetics as felt pressure). The voice occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism—"the first word ever spoken," "the murmuring world"—that sits at the edge of Lysan's plausible register but remains legible as lyric mode taught early. Psychic distance is controlled; the pavilion voice reads as external stimulus, not head-hop. Dialogue (brief, italicized) carries subtext and advances Lysan's choice to stay. Minor density: some similes ("like breath through reeds," "like a blade") are conventional within the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—the archivist notices light angles, shadow stretches, the arrangement of hands in photographs. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("breath held too long," "grief might unravel into art"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts from the grounded professional voice ("perceptively calm" as descriptor, "transmuted pain" in narration). The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains narrative distance, but some lines ("That was the trick of it") feel like helpful narrator syndrome, over-explaining what the images have already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with tight focalization through Elias's perceptual signature (the hum of the hush, the crystal as obsession). Diction is controlled and literary without becoming opaque; voice modulates appropriately under pressure. The woman's dialogue ("You heard it too") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: brief moments of elevated register ("sonically reflective," "reticent no longer") read slightly imposed rather than voice-organic, but they do not break distance. Psychic distance is consistent and the prose rhythm supports scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "air tasted like static," "fog curled...like breath on glass." Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated throughout. The free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the sculpture encounter. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, though a few phrases ("precognitively forgetful," "tuning fork struck against the future") tilt toward elevated register that slightly tensions the grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a lyric register and perceptual signature throughout (Elias notices fractures, shutters, alignments), and the elevated diction ("sage of broken things," "luminous ache") remains consistent with the observatory milieu. However, the voice occasionally drifts into generic wisdom-speak ("the courage to move with it," "the weight of a single, perfect truth") that could belong to any philosophical narrator rather than a specific repairer of cameras. Free indirect distance is stable, and purposeful repetition ("somewhere, a leaf fell...") is taught and paid off, but the texture lacks the idiosyncrasy that would distinguish Elias's interior lexicon from authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature filters sensory detail through Lena's seven-year hospice lens (scent as a temporal marker, "the exact moment hope shifted"). Diction remains voice-consistent, though "decisively kind" and "pulsing stillness" edge toward elevated register. Dialogue is spare, natural, goal-driven: Mrs. Calloway's bitterness and Lena's calm deflection advance the goodbye without exposition. Free indirect style is clean, and the piece avoids head-hopping. Minor slip: "radiant haven" recurs as descriptor rather than evolving through Lena's changing perception under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's perceptual signature is consistent—"quiet deliberation," tactile attention to metal and frost—and her internal voice is distinct. Dialogue with the automaton carries goal-driven subtext and advances plot cleanly. The automaton's grinding-stones voice and spiral pupils are vivid. One slip: "adjust her glasses, quietly deliberate" in the penultimate beat echoes the opening "quiet deliberation" without fresh charge, a minor template recurrence. Psychic distance is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable, third-person limited through Liora with a distinct perceptual signature (bone-setter priorities, forgiving skeptic lens). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("the garden sighed," "yearned to understand"). The changeling's dialogue ("You're not him. But you remember him.") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor register wobble: "a cleft in certainty" and "the shape of mistakes—how they festered if left unstitched" lean slightly elevated for the scene's urgency, but the voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (texture-focused, patient, tactile). Liora's focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I want to learn... how to *keep* it" advances plot). The prose modulates appropriately under emotional pressure (Elias memory tightens syntax, girl's arrival opens rhythm). Slight register drift: "serpentine peace" and "reflectively vibrant" read elevated against the otherwise grounded diction. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Lena; distance modulates purposefully with her attention. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she "followed it like a map," noticed "the honeyed hush." Dialogue is spare, natural, and carries subtext ("What do I do with it?" / "Plant it"). However, several lines drift into elevated register outside Lena's plausible lexicon under pressure: "graft new meaning onto old wounds," "the work of it," "protected vulnerability" as narrator label. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Javier's interiority remains largely opaque, which is acceptable given single-POV focus, but his few lines lack distinct idiom from Lena's narration.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elias's perceptual signature (the seashell as rosary, novels as monuments, characters as "vivid as knife wounds"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the nexus encounter. The prose carries a distinct rhythm—"the current was the story, and the story was alive"—and figurative language (mist as living thing, voices as eels) feels voice-motivated. One slip: the faceless figure's dialogue, "You've been collecting us...But you never let us breathe," reads slightly expository, tilting toward thematic summary rather than character-specific idiom. The final-paragraph shift to external frame (publishers, critics, travelers) is clean but risks diffusing the immediacy of Elias's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices gears, tendrils, and soil pulse in tactile, specific ways. Diction matches her whimsical tinkerer background ("spun copper," "rusted music boxes") and modulates under pressure (shorter syntax during the song). The whispered exchange with the arbor and the hummingbird's chirp function as mild dialogue substitutes, goal-driven and voice-consistent. Elision of the grandmother's actual teaching moment is purposeful and does not obscure causality. One slip: "the thread connecting all things—the turning gears of her automatons, the pulse of the soil, the slow, sure spin of the cosmos" registers slightly elevated for someone mid-crisis, though it remains borderline acceptable as epiphany diction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled diction ("flash-paper alchemist," "subarctic crater where the wind died before it could howl"). Single-POV distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—noticing frost, starlight, patience—is character-specific. However, register occasionally elevates into abstraction ("translate heartbeats into maps," "the art of making time matter") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-native. Some figurative density in the final third approaches overwriting without clear payoff at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the locksmith sees "the thing beside the thing," notices reflections at odd angles, and thinks in metaphors of keys and locks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the timer's first tick ("His throat tightened"), wider for backstory. Diction stays consistent within a reflective, slightly elevated register ("coaxing secrets from metal," "cellar of his reason") that fits the character's contemplative nature. Dialogue is minimal (one brief exchange with the daughter) but carries subtext (her eye-roll versus the flicker of hunger). Minor issue: some phrases feel polished beyond the locksmith's on-page urgency ("the exact pitch of his daughter's laughter the autumn she still believed in monsters"), suggesting authorial voice rather than focalizer under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register: "fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie" establish voice and tone early. Perceptual signature is strong—Elira notices spiral grooves, flame orientation, bronze exhalations—but under peak stress (grotto's reversal) the prose maintains elevated diction without modulating to sharper urgency. The epilogue shift to village perspective is clean and purposeful. One deduction: repeated constructions like "The grotto [verb]" and "She [verb]" create template cadence in several beats, flattening sentence rhythm during high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout with perceptual signature rooted in craft ("the knife biting into the blank," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace"). Diction remains controlled and character-particular—the widow's vocabulary favors tactile and visual precision. The single dialogue exchange with the girl is naturalistic and purposeful, advancing the thematic question. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during carving work, a step back during the tourist-market summary. Minor density concern: "hauntingly practical rhythm" and "rust-hued peace" edge toward elevated register but remain voice-motivated and legible within the lyric mode the piece establishes early.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Close third-person POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: Lira notices through tactile detail (camera wheel pressed to temple, wind carrying "ozone and old carnivals") and metaphor rooted in decay (time frayed, stories coiled). The ghost's italicized dialogue differentiates voice from narration. Brief convergence at "The lagoon didn't ripple. It *remembered.*" reads intentional—external reality echoing internal recognition—and the italics sustain clarity. Psychic distance tightens during the leap ("For a moment, weightless. For a moment, enough.") without filter clutter. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short bursts at the jump, longer accumulation in the ghost chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices circuit-board layouts, rusted gears, and valve mechanics. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"not collapsing, but *resurrecting*" and "*recalibrating*" reflect her engineer's lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; the exchange with the foreman advances her stance without exposition. One minor slip: "the wind through the broken windows whispered like a countdown" feels slightly elevated for her pragmatic register under peak pressure, though it's brief and doesn't obscure clarity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single third-person limited POV with tight focalization and a distinct lyric texture: "voices of a time before silence became his only companion," "the glacial stillness between one heartbeat and the next." Psychic distance contracts under pressure (the kneeling, the fracture) and the prose rhythm accelerates at closure ("tick-tick-ticked, and the world answered"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the scribe notices time, silence, and echoes. Diction remains character-apt; no register drift. Minor penalty: "excruciatingly gentle" in paragraph six reads slightly elevated for peak-beat immediacy, and "petrichor nostalgia" in paragraph four edges toward self-conscious lyricism, but both remain voice-motivated and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable third-limited distance with Liora's perceptual signature (salvager's eye for "brass edges," "thoughtfully clear" ink, objects as prompts). Diction remains consistent—poetic-compressed but legible, with purposeful fragments ("Errant, unsteady, but no longer lost"). The line "hindsight wasn't about seeing clearly. It was about learning to squint" carries voice-specific compression. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during sundial examination, wider during marsh passage). No head-hopping; filter verbs appear but serve the reflective mode. Rhythm varies naturally across beats without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with a lyric, meditative register ("silent histories only the wind and the secret weavers could unspool"). Psychic distance is consistent; perceptual signature (reverent attention to materials, patient decoding) is distinct. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates slightly at the fulgurite revelation (pulse stills, hands tremble) and again at closure (fog thickens, he smiles), maintaining voice under pressure without head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct textural signature: "the way a mother's voice cracked," "geography of healing," "cartographer of the spaces between departure and return." Perceptual filter remains stable throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-bound—Elias as an "obituary writer" would plausibly think in metaphor, yet phrases like "lonesome splendor" and "the kind that promised storms or revelations" feel slightly outside his lexicon under pressure. No dialogue present to assess. Free indirect style is clean; focalization does not leak.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and diction remains within Aldric's lexicon (sacrament, genesis, reverie fit a prince-scholar). Perceptual signature is distinct: he listens for "the echo of one" heartbeat and interprets the creature's song as "a grind of gears trying to mimic." Under peak stress—egg piercing, creature's first flight—syntax compresses without losing internal texture: "Aldric laughed, or perhaps he wept—the difference felt academic when the air itself was vibrating." No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and narrative stance modulates purposefully with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong sensory signature ("jagged," "crackling like dry kindling," "kelp-drift peace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully. The boy's single line of dialogue feels natural. However, several passages drift into elevated register that exceeds the immediate perceptual frame: "graft it to something new," "migration of clouds above mirrored the slow, deliberate rhythm of her work." Filter verbs are used sparingly and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited, stable distance and focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is present: "sharp-edged things, the kind that cut," "luminous skeptic," bread-crumbs as patterns. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with some elevated register ("sidereal patience," "vault of suspended light") that fits the lyric-fabulist mode. Psychic distance tightens during the chamber beat (threads "sticky as honey," younger voice hissing). No head-hopping. The stranger's voice and Liora's younger self create brief dialogue; the stranger's whisper is distinct, the younger voice accusatory. Minor filter-verb presence ("realized," "knew") does not dull immediacy. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during the pull). No template cadence or voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Veyra's perceptual signature is poetic and consistent ("petals of ionized gas drifting," "breath hitched"). Distance stays close-mid throughout. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated for this fantastical register. One problem: repeated sentence stems ("She carried," "She activated," "She closed," "She stepped," "She walked," "She reached") create template cadence in the second half, flattening rhythm under peak pressure. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent focus on the carver's perception throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, tightening during the chisel slip and the spectral encounter. Diction remains within the carver's voice, though phrases like "a current" and "the hollows" occasionally drift toward thematic articulation. The father's italicized voice is distinct and purposeful. The daughter's whispered line and the carver's smile feel slightly under-embodied for the weight of the moment. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance supports the meditative tone without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens during the bob's pause and relaxes for backstory anchors. Diction is character-particular: "ethical diligence," "penitent," "acknowledgment" fit a clockmaker's precise idiom. Perceptual signature is clear—Elias notices gearwork groans, bob curves, salt-spray textures. The prose modulates from meditative reflection to clipped present action ("He pressed the rake handle…"). No head-hopping. Purposeful elision (the drowned child's identity, the fisherman's fate) charges backstory without withholding POV-available facts. The final "Then he reached for his knife and began to carve the next name" could name the victim for sharper closure, but the effect remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent and voice-particular ("blithe," "tenderly organized," "the way soil darkens when turned"). Perceptual signature is strong: a gardener who speaks to worms notices marigolds leaning and roots whispering. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom") that feels ornamental rather than character-rooted, and the widow's off-page dialogue ("*You'll see*") is minimal, so voice distinction cannot be tested. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present (comet ink, kingfisher instinct). Diction elevates consistently ("monochrome waste," "veins of silver threading"), matching the lyric-accumulative mode. However, register drifts slightly high in peak beats ("groundedly imaginative act," "seeding what could grow within the constraints of what was"), where the lexicon sounds conceptual rather than immediate. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (copyist's eye for music, ink, static). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "the story famine," "elusive lyrics," "thistled calm" (though "thistled" reads slightly strained). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—Lira's "My name is Lira, and I remember the color blue" advances plot and carries thematic weight. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during broadcast, wider for the Ministry's discovery). Minor issue: "the only light came from the shortwave radio's dial, its glow secretly luminous" introduces "secretly luminous" as description rather than POV-filtered perception, creating a brief register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct—perceptual signature filters through an artist's lens (charcoal stains, the way light catches ash, porcelain refracting patterns). Interiority is concrete ("Understanding was the enemy of art") and voice-motivated. The two lines of dialogue (visitor's question, Liora's reply; sister's accusation, Liora's reply) carry subtext and advance theme without feeling expository. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Liora's sensory and interpretive experience. Some phrases approach lyric abstraction ("truth was a shape you had to circle") but remain tethered to her artmaking practice. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering all detail through Elias's obsessive, literate perspective ("a rat who'd read too many books," "penitent"). Diction is specific and character-particular ("expedience," "superstitious clutter," "Garbage lasts"). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and distinct: Veyra's pragmatic jabs versus Elias's aphoristic bitterness, the foreman's dry laugh. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("his own pulse synced to its silent rhythm"). One brief filter-verb stack in the dream sequence ("wasn't drowning—he was *building*") does not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elias; psychic distance is stable and controlled. Voice is distinct with elevated but character-consistent diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness"); vocabulary matches a choir teacher's perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and goal-driven ("You're late" holds no reproach, "Just… present" completes the thought). Free indirect style is clean. Brief register elevation ("subtracted by noise," "denote what was missing") fits the reflective, musical frame without breaking legibility or POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric texture: "thick and warm as rising dough," "memories on his tongue didn't taste like loss." Perceptual signature is character-specific—memory-as-taste filters description throughout. However, psychic distance wavers: "The knowledge fruit didn't give answers. / It gave *context*" reads as narrator commentary rather than Elias's realization. The final stanza sequence ("He wasn't a chef anymore. / He was a gardener of moments") employs declarative summary where free indirect reflection would better serve. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "Grow") and serviceable. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Elias's toll-keeper vocabulary and occupational attention (counting steps, handling the box's edges). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the climb, pulling back slightly to register crowd reactions. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; the child's question and Elias's answer carry subtext about transmission of wonder. Voice has distinct texture: "words spilled from him unbidden, raw as honey from a crushed comb." However, some elevated diction ("affliction of truth," "jagged and alive") drifts above Elias's established register during peak stress without clear motivation, and the phrase "the air tasted of rain and possibility" reads as authorial poeticism rather than his idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with Liora's perceptual signature consistent (noticing shifts, sensing beneath surfaces). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "creeping normality," "daydreaming glow," "shard of hush." No head-hopping. Minor stylistic density in some lines ("the scent of orris and wet stone") risks slight overwriting but remains voice-motivated. The voice modulates appropriately from observation to ritual action. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV shifts cleanly between Liora (telepathic, archaic syntax: "Nothing here is as it seems") and the human (embodied, sensory: helmet fogging, ribs aching). Distance control is stable; no head-hopping mid-paragraph. Perceptual signature: Liora perceives thoughts as "coiled" secrets, the human perceives pressure as rib-ache. Dialogue (sign language) is sparse and goal-driven. Minor register drift: "structural weakness of their certainty" and "incisively kind" tilt academic in peak telepathic beats, slightly outside Liora's established diction of pressure-images and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with free indirect touches ("perpetual motion wasn't a failure. It was a choice") that stay voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is consistent: mathematician's lens (recursion, closed systems, proofs), physical anchors (dice in palm, uneven edge biting skin). Diction matches the focalizer's lexicon (theorem, infinite recursion, elegant but useless) without register drift. No head-hopping. The proof whispered aloud and the final shift from "understand the system" to "wanted to" track internal pressure cleanly. Minor deduction: "The pain was a anchor" (missing article) and a few filter-verb clusters ("she had been climbing," "she'd realized") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the painter notices moonlight "like a coin dropped into a wishing well," air tasting "of green things," brush bristles "stiff with the memory of her hand." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains controlled—elevated but consistent, no register clashes. The prose modulates with emotional intensity: compressed syntax during the painting beats, expansive when reflecting on the calligrapher. Minor slip: "the way she'd left before he could thank her properly" edges toward filter-verb stack, but the surrounding texture holds.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Liora; no head-hopping. Diction shows purposeful compression ("thin as the last thread of a spider's abandoned web") that charges atmosphere without obscuring causality. Dialogue carries subtext ("They're forgetting how to knead the steam into it") and the baker's lament about river-curved letters versus tombstone forms. One register slip: "not while the waterfall still sang" and "whispering, *Remember, remember*" in the final passage tilt slightly meta-commentary rather than staying anchored in Liora's perceptual signature under accumulated stress.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices gears, rust, carvings through a clockmaker's lens). Diction is elevated and lyric, matching the conceptual stakes. However, peak-stress compression is uneven: "the world *tilted*—not sideways, but *through*" uses italics and meta-commentary where syntax alone could carry the shift. Several lines ("Its radiance had been a key, not a lock") drift into epigram over embodied perception. Filter verbs ("he understood," "he knew") appear but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lysander. Voice is consistent Gothic-ornate ("lingering luminance," "razor dragged across glass"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-rooted ("unbosom," "photograpically cursed," "repulsive allure"). The advisor's dialogue ("You're bleeding into the negative") and the thing's speech ("Why are you armed with a whisper?") carry subtext and feel distinct from narration. Perceptual signature is present (Lysander notices mirrors, filmstrips, the clasp), but filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "watched") cluster in the middle beats without voice-motivated purpose. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance is controlled. The ornate diction serves atmosphere but occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled metaphoric diction ("sky bled indigo," "unplayed sheet music," "bloomed like a bruise"). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("euphony," "resonance waiting to be coaxed") that reads as writerly rather than character-particular. Under peak pressure (sea's voice, Leeward's laugh), the prose remains ornamental rather than compressing into sharper immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elyas; perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic framing, pattern recognition, haptic and auditory focus). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated for a scholarly cartographer decoding ancient languages. The lyric compression ("threads of light," "chorus of voices not meant for human ears") serves the textural lens and charges the ending. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between intimate (palm to fracture) and panoramic (watchers turning as one).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a literary register ("thick as the mildew," "ghost engineer") that fits the archival setting and Elias's scholarly lens. Dialogue between Elias and Callahan pursues goals and carries subtext, though Callahan's lines veer toward thesis ("burn the tapestry to find a single loose thread?"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices gilt, vellum, and decay—but under peak pressure (Callahan's arrival) the prose stays elevated rather than compressing. Minor filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("adjusted," "traced," "exhaled") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; distance remains close-third with distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices erosion "with the precision of a scientist and the grief of a poet," violet ink, rust smell. Diction ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains against a working surveyor's lexicon, especially under physical pressure (kneeling in waders, prying mortar). Rhythm modulates purposefully: short declaratives at closure ("And so would he.") contrast with earlier lyric layering. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: "his fingers brushing over the parchment like a blind man reading braille," the lamp's glow "pooling" and "raking." Voice is distinct and controlled, with purposeful elevated diction ("dappled," "tranquilly") that fits an indexer's sensibility. Distance modulates appropriately during discovery beats. Deductions: phrases like "tranquilly perceptive as always" and "methodical...precise" trend toward summary labels rather than embodied demonstration. The phrase "the truth wasn't lost. It had only been waiting" in the resolution section slips into abstract declaration. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the maker notices texture (facets, quartz residue, glass veins) and weight (the gem's pull, the isle's tilt). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening from external observation ("fingers trembled") to immersive sensation ("pain lanced up her arm, luminous and white-hot") at the peak beat. The prose rhythm reflects the maker's state: longer, lyric sentences in reflective passages ("She had spent years folding her grief...") compress to fragments under stress ("A breath. / Then the walls *sighed*."). Italicized emphasis (*pulled*, *rewrote*, *unfolding*) is consistent and voice-motivated, charging key verbs without overuse. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. One minor filter-verb cluster in the memory beat ("she was twelve again, her daughter's hand warm") slightly dulls immediacy, but the overall control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with close psychic distance; Lena's perceptual signature (noting the veil's float, calling the geode "a map of something she couldn't name") is consistent and voice-particular. Diction remains controlled ("intangibly tangible," "knife," "bleak exhilaration") without register drift. The scientists' intercom voices provide contrast without head-hopping. One brief elision (three weeks compressed) is paid off when field notes and footage anchor present action. Rhythmic control holds under pressure: short sentences at the climax ("The screen went white. Then—") accelerate momentum. Minor slip: "Subject 7" feels slightly external for close third at that beat, but the immediately following "Lena didn't turn" recovers interior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited on Lena is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (sharp-eyed, attuned to gaps). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("brilliant dimness," "indigo bruise of the sky"). Minor slips: "someone's uncle, maybe, or a scholar" reads as narrator commentary rather than Lena's speculation, blurring distance briefly. The pilgrim's dialogue ("That's not yours") and his "surprised laughter" are functional but generic; no distinct idiom separates his voice from Lena's interior texture. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and clean, but the brief omniscient aside about the pilgrim costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elias's perceptual signature: he notices "filigree edges worn smooth by years of fretting" and interprets driftwood as "too precise to be accidental, too crude to be art." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("slithered into his thoughts," "honed his skill"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the climactic beats. One minor register slip: "the siege of hush: not silence, but the slow sifting of truth" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, though it remains within the genealogist's professional idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited holds Elias's perceptual signature: "preferred to think of them as seeds waiting to root," "he'd spent years recycling mistakes into wisdom." Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Kaelis's "They won't release the boy" and Elias's offer carry subtext and advance plot. Voice modulates under pressure—sharper at the negotiation, gentler with the boy—without head-hopping. Minor issue: some register drift in stressed moments ("the moon hung at half-mast, its phase synchronizing with the tide of their patience" reads elevated for a crisis beat) and a few stock phrases ("ghost of a sibling's love") soften the otherwise distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent interiority and perceptual signature (navigational metaphors, distance measured in regrets). The prose modulates with emotional intensity, and the bar dialogue ("You lost?" / "No, just late") carries subtext. However, some diction slips into elevated register during peak beats ("flickering faith," "collapsed his expectations like a rotted hull") that feel slightly above Elias's established idiom, and "merrily melancholic" is authorial rather than character-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Liam; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during lake immersion, pulled back during transit). Diction carries noir-tinged weariness appropriate to the character ("sickly yellow," "city's pulse muted to a distant hum"). However, elevated lyricism occasionally drifts beyond Liam's established register ("ozone after a storm that hadn't happened yet," "comet tail of disrupted light"). The victim's dialogue in the park reads distinct and wary, passing voice-distinction test. Free indirect blends cleanly with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, controlled in knowledge and perception. Voice carries distinct texture ("secrets whispered between stars," "hollow so vast it had its own gravity") with lyric compression that remains legible. The stag "speaks" in earth-language without violating POV bounds. Filter verbs ("she understood then") appear but are voice-motivated. One slip: "the orchard held its breath" anthropomorphizes setting in a way that momentarily drifts from Liora's perceptual filter. Diction stays within her focalizer range except for "porous" in the penultimate paragraph, which feels slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance with a distinct lyrical-archaic register ("bled through the canopy," "silence: the kind that swallows hours whole") that fits the cartomancer's voice. Perceptual signature is strong—Liora notices constellations "only she could read" and interprets the crack as "a jagged sigh." The brother's dialogue ("You found me") uses purposeful compression (mouth doesn't move) to signal his liminal state. Minor strain appears in elevated diction during peak beats ("the slow unraveling of regret") that slightly distances reader from urgency, but the voice remains coherent and the focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and close to Lien. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices tears, threads, shimmer, shadow. Diction stays controlled ("sliver of black glass," "spun thin," "silvered weight") with purposeful elevation that fits the lyric-SF register. No head-hopping. The AI's brief lines read as external voice. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at closure ("she feared she might unravel").

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent elevated register ("breath a slow curl of embers," "orchestrates coincidences without meaning to"). Psychic distance is stable—close third with no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("A detour, then. A prophecy, then.") teaches a pattern of abrupt turns that supports the accumulative mode. However, some diction ("orchestrates coincidences," "alchemy of understanding") feels slightly external to Elira's lived perception, reading more authorial than character-filtered. The final image's syntax tightens effectively ("the horizon was a blade of gold"), and no filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is consistent (lock mechanisms as "verses," tools as "cradle of sparks"). Diction stays within a poetic-yet-tactical register without unmotivated drift. Brief elisions (allies "he'd never met") are purposeful and paid off by the mirror flash. However, some filter verbs ("His fingers brushed," "Kael exhaled") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, and the final whistle—a gesture rich in subtext—arrives without the specificity of tune or rhythm that would distinguish it from stock.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited with tight focalization through Liora's perceptual signature: she notices patterns, sequences, the "moment before something shifted." Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("slick as a breath held too long," "fine as regret," "warm as a pulse"). Purposeful compression in "It was why she placed the painted rocks now" trusts the reader to infer ritual continuity. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the dust contact, wider during the eels' return. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: "the dawn broke, stolen and fragile" edges toward poetic assertion outside her immediate perception, but the effect supports closure tone.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with psychic distance modulating appropriately. Voice carries lyric elevation ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy," "cartography of scars") that fits a poet-protagonist but occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("vigil in pause," "promise disguised as endings") without grounding in immediate perception. Filter verbs ("watched," "knew," "wondered") appear frequently but are voice-consistent. No head-hopping. The prose rhythm shifts purposefully between long, imagerich sentences during reflection and shorter beats during action. Diction remains within a literary register throughout, though "storm-kissed wonder" and similar constructions lean toward stock poeticism rather than character-particular idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias; perceptual signature (mechanical arm adjustments, pulse quickening) anchors his POV. Dialogue carries subtext—Liora's "Took you long enough" and "Lock's been broken for decades" reveal her testing motive obliquely. Voice modulates with pressure: short clauses during blade clashes, longer syntax in the resolution. Minor slip: "diplomatically fierce" and "calculated smirk" lean toward filter-heavy summary rather than showing Liora's stance through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a lyric-literary register with controlled rhythm and distinct perceptual signature ("moon clawed free," "silver wound in the sky"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Maren's "You're still here" and Elias's reply carry subtext and goal (mutual acknowledgment of stakes). Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Elias, though brief passages ("some things…were bigger than the names they wore") flirt with omniscient assertion. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but one phrase—"because the act itself was resistance"—reads as authorial interjection rather than Elias's idiom under pressure. Diction remains elevated but coherent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Lena's perceptual signature is consistent: practical, strategic, tinged with quiet defiance ("her longing steely as the blade of a knife"). Psychic distance tightens slightly under pressure ("She exhaled, her breath visible") without over-explaining. The lover's brief dialogue carries distinct subtext (apologetic smile, mirrored retort). Diction is elevated but stays within a voice that maps invisible currents and splices film with hidden notation. Minor issue: "strategically creative" and "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" edge toward authorial framing rather than Lena's idiom, though they remain borderline acceptable as free indirect summary of her internal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora filters the world through her role as reality checker, noticing fissures, resonance, and distortions. Diction mostly fits her character, though some phrases ("empirical whimsy," "collective memory's tapestry") tilt toward academic register during high-pressure beats. The child's dialogue at the end feels natural and advances the moment. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the seed-bite sequence. However, lines like "the weight of a thousand years pressing behind her eyes" risk elevated abstraction where concrete sensory breakdown would sharpen the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and richly textured: "each word were a seed he didn't want to crush between his teeth" captures Elias's slow-spoken caution. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices the compass's warmth, the bonsai's trembling leaves, the scent of salt and damp earth. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the humming ritual, slightly wider in the final paragraph's summary). A few filter verbs ("He understood then") are acceptable within voice, but the closing line "taught it to lean into the wind" slips into slight poeticism that feels authored rather than felt. Overall, voice is controlled and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is assured and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters everything through astrophysics and decay. Syntax and rhythm are well-modulated, capable of lyricism without losing clarity. The narrative distance holds steady, and the occasional more abstract sentence still feels like Elias’s mind at work. With no dialogue to test, the piece nonetheless maintains a unified, character-inflected narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third voice is consistent, sensuous, and clearly colored by Liora’s identity as a glass artist, producing a distinct perceptual signature (light, fracture, pattern, breath). Rhythm and syntax vary well, with long, flowing sentences front-loading imagery and shorter ones punctuating realizations (“She didn’t look back.”). The lyricism feels confident rather than mannered, and there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. A few thesis-like lines momentarily edge toward authorial abstraction, but they don’t fundamentally disrupt the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong sensory and conceptual through-line around sound, cold, and emotion. Phrasing like “a tomb of winterglass” and “warped and wet, like a voice rising from deep water” shows controlled metaphor rather than random ornament. Psychic distance is steady third-limited; we’re close enough to Liora’s perceptions without head-hopping or expository smoothing. A few sentences verge on rhetorically “big” in close succession, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads as deliberate style rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-inflected, with a distinct texture (“their pulse slow, like the breath of a sleeping beast”; “as if the sea had coughed up a piece of its own guilt”). Diction and rhythm modulate well with pressure, becoming more compressed and focused at the lighthouse without losing clarity. POV control is tight—no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience beyond a modest, voice-consistent wideness. The lyricism occasionally nears the decorative, but it remains mostly purposeful and anchored in Elias’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear preference for patterned sentences and quiet intensification that suits the subject. Repetition (“He never declared…”) and parallel structures feel intentional and reinforce the thematic focus on nonverbal declaration. POV distance remains steady, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. A few aphoristic lines risk sounding authorial rather than strictly character-filtered but do not materially disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically textured, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Elias notices light, breath, and small transformations.

The voice is strong enough to carry the lyricism without collapsing into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and sensuous, with a consistent lexicon of geometry and organic imagery that feels specific to Liora’s mind. POV is steady, with no leakage, and the brief dialogue reflects character and situation without flattening into exposition.

Occasionally the narration leans into abstract phrasing that slightly distances us, but it never loses clarity or tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct cadence (“Resilience didn’t grow in straight lines. It twisted. It waited. It won.”). Diction and rhythm align with Lena’s focused, quietly fierce perspective; aphoristic moments feel voice-suited rather than imposed omniscience. There’s no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts, and the absence of dialogue (beyond shouted noise) suits the solitary, covert mission. The only minor risk is occasional loftiness in the final didactic turns, though it stays within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature built around synesthetic blends of sound, color, and metal. Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, with sentences modulating nicely between compressed lyricism and slightly more expository clauses where needed. The narrative never cheats on POV knowledge and sustains a coherent interior lens even as it leans into metaphor. The density of figurative language is high but patterned and purposeful rather than random.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a strong lyrical texture that matches the magical, fatalistic premise—phrases like “moved like a shadow with a gilded edge” feel character-specific rather than generic purple. POV stays stable with no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue from the stationmaster sounds distinct and functional. Rhythmic control is good, with sentence length and intensity modulating at key turns (e.g., around the mirror and jar shattering). A few elevated turns of phrase feel more authorial than strictly Liora-bound, but they don’t break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and distinctly Elara’s, with glassmaking metaphors and technical habits (“first, you prime the heat exchangers…”) giving her a clear perceptual signature. POV is stable, tense consistent, and the brief quoted lines function as internalized, half-spoken habits rather than dialogue, maintaining distance control. A very slight tendency toward uniformly elevated diction in all beats is the only thing that keeps this from feeling utterly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—lean, charged, and slightly sardonic—that remains consistent under stress. Diction (“liability,” “placeholder,” “outwitted fear”) suits a working professional who’s been through institutional betrayal without drifting into clinical or corporate register. Dialogue is economical and character-specific; the girl’s simple, uncanny lines contrast effectively with Lena’s more guarded, ironic speech and advance subtext. Rhythm modulates well between tense beats and reflective fragments, supporting both suspense and the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyric register feels earned by the fable-like frame.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV through Elias is steady and confident, with a distinct, slightly lyrical but workmanlike voice that fits a veteran mechanic in a strange environment (“fingers that remembered every bolt, every seam”).

A slight tendency toward earnest, explanatory phrasing near the end keeps it from feeling entirely effortless.

The voice feels confident and unified enough for publication at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“procedural generation,” “darkening brightness”) that suits the speculative frame. Rhythm and sentence variation are well handled, keeping the prose musical without losing clarity.

    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct texture—marsh reeds, crystalline orchards, shimmering craters—yet remains clear. Focalization is mostly close to Reed with occasional village-level omniscience (the Syl ghost story) that still supports the piece’s communal emphasis rather than feeling like leakage. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext in short exchanges (“You didn’t have to look” / “But we did.”). The rhythmic control is strong, though in a few spots the narration sounds slightly more like an overseeing intelligence than Reed’s exact perceptual filter, which keeps it just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility as an archivist attuned to residue and omission.

Psychic distance is well handled: the narration hovers close enough to capture his worldview without slipping into omniscient explanation.

Diction and metaphor density are controlled, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip into generic omniscience. The focalization stays steady, with the external lyric flourishes plausibly justified by Elias as “accidental poet.” There are a few near-authorial formulations, but they do not break the coherence of the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct texture—slightly lyrical, concrete, and attentive to the city’s sensorial chaos in a way that feels tied to Elira.

Rhythm and sentence length modulate well between long, textured lines and terser beats (“The signal died.”) for emphasis. The limited omniscience stays consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous explanation. At times the narration tilts toward a more essayistic register in the closing reflections, which mildly distances us from the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled (“rusted needle in the throat of the sea,” “copperlight in his teeth”), with a consistent perceptual bias toward sound and light that fits the premise. POV remains stable and plausible; omniscient-leaning touches (“The first body would be found at noon”) read as deliberate, framing moves rather than leakage.

    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly wedded to Lena’s sensibility, with images that feel like her mind’s idiom rather than generic prettiness. Diction and rhythm modulate well, moving from dense metaphor in reflective moments to plainer, clean dialogue with the boy.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident, consistent, and markedly particular (“reef-shadow joy,” “helmet filled with seawater and forgotten vows”), with strong rhythmic control. POV distance is stable and appropriate for a mythic, fabular feel, and the sparse dialogue has distinct textures (rusted accusation vs. her precise correction).

Psychic distance is steady; we remain close to Liora without head-hopping, and the narrative never claims knowledge she cannot plausibly have.

    The close third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, character-colored diction (“carefully reckless,” “the harmonic gaps between its phrases”). The narrative stance stays tied to Elara’s perception while allowing a lightly omniscient-feeling poise that fits the quasi-mythic register. The modulation from somber and penitent to cautiously exultant at the end is well handled without breaking voice. A few late lines feel more authorial than strictly character-bound, but not enough to materially weaken POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in Liora’s way of reading materials, pressure, and mechanism as language. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, with sensory details interleaved into thought in a way that feels organic rather than ornamental. The elevated diction suits the semi-mythic tone without drifting into abstraction, and there is no POV leakage or confusing distance shift. Dialogue is sparse but clean and purposeful, aligning with the power dynamics between Liora and the elders.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is distinctive, with sensibility rooted in music and books—metaphors of sheet music, records, ledgers, and constellations feel character-true. POV control is tight; interiority and observation blend without head-hopping or unearned omniscience, and psychic distance modulates smoothly at emotional peaks. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially Madame Holloway’s line about the pigeons being “the only thing you’ve let yourself keep,” which carries subtext and pressure. Lyricism is high but never so ornate as to obscure meaning, maintaining clarity under emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with recurring avian/light imagery (“featherly determined,” “like a bird deciding whether to take flight”) creating a recognizable texture. Diction sits just on the high-lyric side of believable for a limited narrator but remains consistent and legible. POV discipline is strong—no head-hopping, and interior access modulates with the scene’s intensity. A few coinages and metaphors (“fractured hush,” “story refolding itself”) flirt with over-stylization but overall contribute to, rather than dilute, the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct: scientific yet lyrical, with a sustained attention to pattern and light that feels like Elara’s mind. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and psychic distance is well-managed, zooming in on sensory particulars when it matters. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtly revealing (“holding onto something too tightly”; the AI’s dry line about “luminous respite”). A couple of phrasings (“laughed, softly ingenious”) draw slight attention to themselves but don’t disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly tuned to this character’s sensibility, with consistent nautical and mineral imagery that reads as a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm varies well; sentence structures are not monotonous, and the narrative distance remains close without head-hopping. Diction stays within a believable poetic register for this fantastical mode and rarely drifts into jarring abstraction. The voice carries the accumulative drive effectively and modulates from wonder to acceptance at the end without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on timing, pattern, and incidental details others ignore. Phrases like “orchestrating serendipity” and “the tide’s relentless math” feel intrinsic to Lior’s mind rather than imposed. POV control is tight; we never slip unmotivated into others’ interiors, and the brief dialogue lines sound natural within this world. Rhythm and diction modulate well across beats, supporting the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinctive, with images like “the last light bled into shadow” and “a cosmic verse etched into mortal flesh, the kind that made the sky jealous.” Diction and syntax are consistent with a mythic, lyric register and modulate subtly as pressure builds. Perceptual focus (gaps, reflections, breath) feels character-specific rather than generic poeticism. It stops just short of experimental risk-taking that would justify a higher, truly singular score.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and deeply colored by Elias’s sensibility as a glazier and observer of light. Diction and metaphors (“like a held breath,” “noctilucent reckonings”) feel coherent within the piece’s aesthetic and never tip into register-breaking abstraction. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between external detail and interior reflection without confusion. The absence of dialogue fits the contemplative mode and avoids any POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensorially rich, and plausibly matched to a seasoned firefighter marked by trauma and taciturnity. Diction and rhythm (“quiet that settled like ash,” “its cracks now filled with pine sap and moonlight”) create a distinct lyrical texture without losing clarity. Occasional conceptual lines (“slow dance of celestial bodies,” “alchemize”) push toward the poetic but still feel integrated with the established narrative stance rather than like authorial intrusion. The controlled, reflective distance supports the accumulative design and the interior, low-dialogue mode.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident and consistent, marrying scientific lexicon (“equations,” “potential,” “altitude gauge”) with lush, lyrical imagery without register clashes. POV is cleanly limited to Liora’s consciousness, and the narrative distance is well controlled, allowing both close sensory detail and conceptual reflection. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, with repeated motifs used as pattern rather than artifact. The only minor limit is that the lyric register runs at a fairly uniform intensity, with little modulation into plainer texture to create contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sound, texture, and ruin. Diction and rhythm feel consistent with a quiet, obsessive listener; the narrative does not drift into expository or alien registers. There is no dialogue, but interior access is steady and never omniscient beyond Elias’s plausible inferences. Under rising pressure, the voice tightens rather than frays, maintaining clarity while sustaining a distinct, atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct texture in its diction (“borrowed heartbeats,” “painter of the almost-real”) and a stable close-third stance that occasionally leans omniscient without breaking coherence. Rhythm varies well, sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, atmosphere) without bloat, and the tonal register feels unified. Interior access to Liora is consistent and filtered through her sensibility, even when the narration grows more sweeping. There are no POV slips or register jolts that disturb the reading.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lucid, and well-modulated, with a strong lyric texture that suits the gravitas of the scene. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, and the dialogue is lean, carrying subtext and status without over-exposition. Veyra’s narrative lens blends external observation with ritual-inflected interiority in a consistent way, while Kael’s lines and physicality provide a distinct counter-voice. The occasional aphoristic sentence is more a stylistic choice than a flaw and doesn’t break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s detached yet haunted sensibility. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with declarative bursts (“The egg would not hatch. / The bird was gone.”) puncturing the more sinuous description. Diction feels unified—elevated but not academic—and avoids register jolts. The narrative stance maintains a tight psychic distance that aligns with the story’s moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and stable, with a distinct texture of crystalline, sensory metaphors that match the sanctuary’s aesthetic. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with good modulation between longer, ornate sentences and sharper, decisive beats at turns (“The gates groaned open.” “She let them touch her.”). The narrative distance stays close enough to Liora to feel embodied while retaining an almost ceremonial tone that suits her role. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice carries subtext about restraint, spectacle, and defiance without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (metaphors of sound, rust, light, and silence) that feels specific to this narrator and character. POV is clean and stable, balancing close interiority with slightly elevated diction without obvious register breaks. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, modulating between dense image-making and calmer exposition in ways that suit the emotional beats. Even with its lyricism, the narrative remains legible and doesn’t veer into incoherent abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is consistent and character-specific, comfortably carrying elevated diction suited to an “esoteric realist.” Rhythm varies, with lush but controlled sentences that fit the contemplative mode. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the prose modulation from observation to quiet climax (wing’s departure, bell toll) feels intentional and well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in casting metaphors and sensory attention to ice, light, and breath. Diction is consistently elevated but character-coherent; sentences vary rhythmically, and key lines (“snowmelt ardor given form,” “a silhouette finally free of the weight of silence”) land with precision rather than bloat. Psychic distance is steady, allowing both intimate interiority and wider atmospheric observation without head-hopping or stance confusion. There are no dialogue demands here, and no visible voice slips or gratuitous register drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyric texture (“the bunker had been swallowing its own echoes,” “thunder laughed”) that feels character-inflected rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is controlled: we stay near Lior’s perceptions even when diction is elevated, and the brief dialogue from the mural-Lior fits the tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the pattern of image-driven narration is taught early and maintained. Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely with pressure, especially around the bunker’s transformation and the storm’s break.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a learned, reflective astronomer—elevated but not implausibly academic. The narrative stance stays inside his knowledge and biases while allowing some quietly omniscient turns that feel like his long-practiced, analytical mind rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer, sinuous sentences for reflection and crisper lines at decision points (“He stepped forward”). The perceptual signature—counting, mapping, reading schematics as constellations—gives the voice distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrical but controlled, with a consistent third-person-limited focus through Lior’s perceptions and biases. Dialogue rhythm feels natural and age-distinct ("You’re late" / "Grace doesn’t keep to schedules"), carrying subtext about delay, obligation, and ambivalence. The prose modulates intensity well between memory shards and present-tense pressure. A few lines verge on crafted quotability, but they still fit the established tone rather than reading like intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive, glassy lyricism that matches the character’s craft and the story’s imagery. Rhythm and syntax vary nicely, and figurative language usually feels precise (“fog that coiled through the district was thick enough to muffle even memory”). Limited dialogue is clean and used sparingly, carrying subtext (“You were always too grounded”) without breaking the tone. The only minor limitation is that the high lyric register is very uniform; a slight modulation at peak emotional beats might have added more dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that feels attuned to this particular character’s craft and preoccupations (quartz, ribs, stitches, cracks). Rhythm varies effectively between lush description and clipped realizations (“So the mender dug.” / “The mender laughed, sharp and sudden, because of course…”). Figurative language is patterned enough to feel intentional without becoming opaque, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shift. The occasional aphoristic sentence fits the fable-like register and doesn’t disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, slightly wry, and consistent, with a good balance between lyric strangeness and clear reporting (“where the trees grew in the shape of questions”). POV is stable, with no head-hopping and a controlled psychic distance that moves smoothly between sensory detail and conceptual realization. Diction fits a highly educated, weird-science curator without drifting into flat academese. Occasional explicit labels (“Nonlinear inheritance”) are justified by character and genre, keeping the voice distinctive rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with diction that matches an arcane, slightly archaic sensibility (“voice smooth as old parchment”) without tilting into self-parody. The narrative filters description through Elias’s obsession with language and absence, giving the piece a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext and power dynamics (“grief was a renewable resource” encapsulates his ruthlessness). A few lines flirt with over-poetic generality, but they rarely break character-bound plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a strong lyrical texture (“the space between memories, where the names of the erased still grew wild”) that clearly belongs to this consciousness. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with image-rich sentences modulating into slightly plainer ones at action beats so the narrative never fully drowns in ornament. The few lines of dialogue feel natural and understated, letting image and implication carry most of the weight. The perceptual signature—obsession with color, decay, and distortions—is consistent enough to feel like character, not generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending precise technical vocabulary (“mechanism room,” “ledger”) with lyric flourish (“voice like ink drying on parchment”) in a way that suits an erudite archivist. POV is stable, and the brief dialogue feels slightly heightened but consistent with the mythic, fable-like mode. The prose modulates well between dense description and cleaner action syntax during key beats (the rebraiding sequence, the door opening). For absolute top-tier, one might want occasional sharper, more idiosyncratic turns of thought that more clearly separate Elara’s inner idiom from the narrator’s lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in physical processes (breath, tremors, crack patterns) and acoustic metaphors. Syntax modulates well between long, flowing sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones for turns (“His motivation wasn’t escape. / It was preservation.”). There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the abstract language (“bloom of hush,” “storm became a lullaby”) feels organic to the world rather than pasted-on poetics. A bit more modulation into roughness at peak tension could add texture, but line for line the voice is confident and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by her mix of technical familiarity (star paths, scholars) and weary awe. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate well between reflective passages and the flare sequence. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience; everything stays tightly bound to her perceptions and inferences. A few phrases brush familiar lyrical territory, but overall the perceptual signature feels specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Summer-Quill’s sensibility and vocation. Diction and metaphor choices (“breath of the unspoken,” “the rain’s afterecho”) feel cohesive rather than random, and the narrative distance stays comfortably close without slipping. Modulation at the end—shorter, simpler lines around “The inkwell was full. / The page was blank. / And for the first time, that was enough.”—shows solid rhythmic control. There’s slight risk of uniform loftiness, but it rarely drifts out of what feels plausible for this consciousness and world.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature grounded in Liora’s sensory and professional lexicon. Rhythms modulate well between lush description and clipped, charged beats (“Her pulse quickened.” / “The fortress trembled.”). A few closing aphorisms feel more like authorial proclamation than this specific character’s spontaneous thought, slightly flattening the otherwise distinct voice. Overall, POV is stable and confident, with only minor drift into generalized wisdom-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors and observations clearly rooted in the chronicler’s sensibility (tidal imagery, “tangential” crab-like thinking). POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge—and psychic distance modulates smoothly from sensory immediacy to reflective insight. Dialogue, while sparse, feels natural and subtext-rich, especially in the fisherman’s “You don’t have to say it.” The rhythmic control of sentences under emotional pressure is strong, supporting mood without tipping into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and highly textured, with a distinct sensory lexicon (taste, hush, ribs, vines) that clearly belongs to this consciousness and world. Rhythm and syntax are well modulated—lyric but controlled, with sentence length and structure shifting appropriately as pressure rises. The occasional elevated phrase (“xenial trellis,” “conceptually repricing” silences) still feels integrated into the established voice rather than imposed from outside. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the doll’s quoted lines feel like an intrusion of a different register in a purposeful, charged way.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice around Elias is stable, confident, and texturally distinct, with consistent sensory priorities and metaphoric habits that feel like his long apprenticeship to stillness. Lyric sentences (“vaulting hush so deep it hummed in the bones”) coexist with clear, concrete actions, and the occasional dialogue line is spare, natural, and subtext-heavy. Psychic distance is managed well, never slipping into authorial omniscience or explanatory overreach. The modulation of rhythm at the end—toward shorter, quieter beats—supports the closure effect without calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is assured and textured, with a consistent blend of mythic and technological diction that matches Elsin’s role as lore keeper in a quasi-futuristic world. Sentences vary in rhythm and length in ways that track emotional intensity—the descent tightens, the return to the orchard relaxes. The narration never over-explains or leaks knowledge beyond Elsin’s plausible inferences. Lyric touches (“the dew of forgotten fruit,” “bleeding into dawn”) feel voice-consistent rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly Lior-colored, with metaphor choices (ash, breath, thresholds) reflecting his worldview and role. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter, declarative turns at key beats (“Lior stepped through. He didn’t look back.”). Dialogue is sparse but effective and tonally matched, with the shadow’s lines carrying subtext rather than exposition. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the lyricism feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured with Lina’s specific lexicon (leverage, exchange rate, recruiter smiles) and sensibility. Lyric touches (“shadowseam,” “compressed regret,” “the idea of pressure peeling away from diamond”) feel character-compatible and pattern-taught rather than arbitrarily elevated. The integration of on-page text messages is clean and rhythmically effective, punctuating beats without breaking POV. There’s strong modulation between eerie wonder and sardonic bite, with no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a refined, slightly archaic register that fits Elias and the scholarly-dynastic milieu. Diction and syntax create a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “eloquently silent in his failure,” “a bridge of intuition”) without slipping into generic lyricism. The modulation at key beats—the reflection’s voiceless line, the grandfather’s voice in his marrow, the quiet exhalation at the end—feels earned and precise. There is no head-hopping or distance confusion, and the elevated style remains plausible for this focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is distinctive and controlled, with memorable metaphors (“sky split like rotten silk,” “mirror’s cruelty”) and a consistent psychic distance aligned with the knight’s perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person narration has a consistent, slightly elegiac texture that suits both Elias’s temperament and the institutional setting. Diction and metaphor feel plausibly within his mental register and never tip into authorial grandstanding. Psychic distance is well-controlled, zooming in on tactile details (spines, dust, the button) and zooming out for brief, earned reflections. There are no POV slips or expository intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly colored by Lena’s archivist’s sensibility (focus on records, names, ledgers). Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence and paragraph lengths modulating around key images (“receiver dangling like a broken promise,” “liquid memory,” “static of erased voices”). The aphoristic turns (“The fight wasn’t in the streets. It was in the cracks…”) are stylistically coherent but occasionally sound more like authorial commentary than Lena’s interior texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying stakes and character without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries musical metaphor to environmental observation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrically assured, with a distinct texture of mythic yet intimate diction (“mossy” in feel, quiet and delighted by strangeness). POV is stable, close third on Liora with no leakage, and the cadences adjust well between awe-filled description and more compressed action beats. Metaphoric choices (“sky the color of old parchment,” “fragments of the First Song”) feel internally coherent to the world’s logic and to Liora’s sensibility. The control is strong enough for publication-level work, though not quite so idiosyncratic or surprising as to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled rhythm and a distinct perceptual bias toward mechanical and organic imagery that feels particular to this character. Syntax modulates well between long, incantatory sentences and sharper beats at key turns (“He understood then.”).

The voice is memorable and cohesive without tipping into self-indulgent ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)

Rhythm and syntax modulate well between lush description and tighter, decision-driven lines, and there’s no POV slippage. The lyric register is high but feels coherent with Liora’s profession and preoccupation with transformation. Occasional lines verge on rhetoric, yet they don’t break distance control or feel out of character.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphors and sensory priorities. The prose often slides close to poetic omniscience but stays credibly tethered to Liora’s sensibility, especially in how it thinks about the dead and about sound. Dialogue is sparse yet natural and goal-driven, revealing the soul’s desire to be “the joke, not the punchline” without over-explaining. Rhythm and diction modulate well with intensity, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism that matches Liran’s hyper-attuned, traumatized state. Diction is consistent—technical where apt (“yield stress,” “orbital decay,” “ultraviolet”) yet sensorial and bodily in peak beats. POV is stable with no head-hopping; the interrogator and grandmother appear only via vision/memory filtered through him. At times the elevated, aphoristic turns push the limits of what someone in his immediate condition might frame so cleanly, but the mythic tone mostly earns that stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and recognizably Lior’s, with a strong perceptual signature centered on liminal sensations and half-seen details. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with cadences that suit the contemplative, uncanny atmosphere. Dialogue is sparse but tonally apt (the painter’s lines are pointed and slightly oracular without breaking register). The voice could stretch more under moments of heightened pressure, but as-is it’s polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, marrying technical diction (“mainspring barrel,” “anchor bolts”) with lyrical observation (“Dust was a language”) in a way that feels specific to Elias. Psychic distance stays stable, and the few lines of dialogue from ghosts carry a different, simpler cadence. Rhythm modulates well between slower, atmospheric sentences and tighter, action-focused lines as the mechanism is revealed and dismantled. The voice is memorable and confident without drawing attention away from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice has a strong, coherent lyrical texture—measured, imagistic, slightly ceremonial—that fits both Elias’s meticulous craft and the mythic library. POV is stable, with a controlled zoom-out near the end (the “next operator” and future cycles) that feels like an intentional widening rather than a leak. Diction (“liquid time,” “pressing whispers into ink,” “compressed eternity”) is distinctive but consistent, avoiding register clashes. The voice modulates well with pressure, tightening and sharpening images as the rupture peaks without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and well-suited to a former poet’s perception—baroque but controlled.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct idiom of craft and alchemical metaphor that feels unified to Elias’s sensibility and the story’s mythic register. Rhythm and syntax modulate well as pressure rises (from patient description to more incantatory clauses in the climax). Occasional omniscient reaches (about the city and thieves) are consistent with the fable-like stance and don’t jar. The voice is memorable and coherent without slipping into self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-closish voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., industrial remnants and damp stone filtered through a collector of transient phenomena). Rhythm and diction support the contemplative, hushed tone without slipping into abstraction, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts. The narrative handles the fantastical elements (reverse waterfall, humming arches) with the same calm observational cadence, which heightens their uncanny quality. Dialogue is minimal (father’s remembered line) but integrated naturally as pressure rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture that matches Elias’s artistic mind. Diction choices like “timewoven alliances” and “scaffold of simplicity” feel intentional rather than random ornament, contributing to a distinct perceptual signature. The brief dialogue at the docks is natural and understated, fitting the established tone. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion undermining the lyric stance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and distinctive, with a meld of political and mystical awareness fitting a civil-rights archivist in a surreal world. Diction is elevated but coherent with Elias’s interiority, and the lyrical rhythm modulates well under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the Revision Board’s bureaucratic menace (“restricted memory”) contrasted with Elias’s raw warning. No POV slippage or stance confusion appears despite some heavy metaphorical load.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits an old, meticulous alchemist contemplating metaphysical work. Diction balance is strong: elevated but not so ornate that it feels authorial rather than character-shaped, and the narrative doesn’t slip into registers that break the spell. The single line of dialogue from the child is appropriately simple and distinct, underscoring the contrast between his austere mindset and the town’s ordinary warmth. Psychic distance stays controlled, tightening around key beats (scent shift, child’s touch, bottle’s lightness) without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is assured and distinctive, with diction and imagery perfectly matched to a meticulous, historically minded archivist. Sentences modulate rhythm well, lingering on ritual and sensory detail, tightening when the prophecy appears.

    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct: gently lyrical, with an artisan’s attention to physical process and acoustic nuance. Diction choices (“great bronze throats,” “thread of warning stitching through the storm’s roar”) feel character-compatible rather than imposed, suggesting someone who lives inside sound and craft. Rhythm varies well between long, atmospheric sentences and tighter action beats when he detects and corrects the flaw. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory overreach; the narrative confidence matches what Elias can plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly filtered through Eli’s contemplative sensibility. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between quiet description and charged moments (the alarms, the contact with the star) without losing control. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, especially the understated transmission exchange that contrasts his inner revelation with institutional bafflement. A few lines tip into generalized “wisdom-speak,” but overall the perceptual signature and cadence are distinct and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third, lightly omniscient voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in bees, wind, glass, and weight. Syntax varies well, and the lyricism largely feels earned, especially in the wing-sound and final wind imagery. The narrator’s certainty about ghosts and covenants fits an almost-mythic stance rather than breaking POV modesty. Occasionally, patterned sentence openings (“He had spent… / He had spent… / It was… / It was…”) brush up against formula, but they stop short of true monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits both Elias’s vocation and the uncanny premise. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and metaphors (needle in the earth, fossilized spring, overripe fruit) are generally apt and memorable. Occasionally the narration slips into aphoristic, authorial-sounding lines that feel slightly less rooted in Elias’s psyche, but this doesn’t break POV. Overall the perceptual signature is distinct and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is assured, with a distinct, contemplative texture that clearly belongs to this poet’s way of seeing (e.g., “like the half-remembered melodies of a song sung underwater”). Rhythm is varied and controlled; long, lush sentences are balanced with short emphatic ones at key beats (“The poet didn’t look up.”). There is no POV leakage or register drift, and the lyric distance holds even as events occur. The only minor limitation is that the voice stays within one tonal band, rarely modulating into sharper or more jagged rhythms that might mirror inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture that matches Elira’s sensibility—rich in botanical and architectural metaphors without losing clarity. POV stays stable, with a graceful, motivated shift to follow Tomas after Elira’s death; there’s no head-hopping or distance confusion. Dialogue is spare but strong and subtextual (the “beg” vs. “ask” exchange neatly encodes their differing philosophies). Rhythmic control is good, with longer, sensuous sentences in reflective passages and tighter beats around key interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and lyrically confident, with recurring textural choices (“rain on bronze,” “stone skin slick with memory”) that feel unified rather than ornamental. POV is stable, with a brief, deliberate pullback in the University coda that still reads as anchored by Elara’s absence. Syntax and rhythm vary appropriately, and the few lines of dialogue (especially the figure’s) carry distinct tonal weight. The voice has a clear perceptual signature—precise scientific awareness inflected by reluctant awe.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a consistent gothic-naturalist register that matches subject and mood. The perceptual signature—attention to birds, soil, bones, and subtle sounds like humming seed pods—feels specific to this character. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation between present action and remembered battle is clean. Its main limitation is that the voice, while strong, is familiar in contemporary literary-mag prose rather than unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with striking metaphors and a controlled, elegiac rhythm that suits the material. The “wild hush” atmosphere, phonograph-poetics, and quiet imperative statements (“Now you carry the message.”) give the narration a strong tonal identity. That said, the diction and conceptual framing feel more like an omniscient, human lyricist than a truly Rook-specific interiority, so the perceptual signature is less individualized than it could be. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, just a deliberate fable-like distance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture without losing clarity, and the perception is consistently anchored in Lira’s sensorium and lexicon. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively between quiet observation and the more heightened moments around the anomaly and leap. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; the slight omniscient zoom at the end (“Somewhere…”) feels like a deliberate widening rather than leakage. Overall, the narrative voice feels confident and controlled, well-suited to the story’s contemplative SF mood.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a strong lyrical bent that matches the surreal setting (“her breath curling in shapes that weren’t quite smoke”). POV control is cleanly third-person close on Lirien with no head-hopping, and the prose modulates rhythm effectively between action and reflection. Dialogue is lean, goal-driven, and distinct in idiom: the Keeper’s cold severity contrasts with Lirien’s measured boldness. The heightened diction might be a touch ornate for some venues, but it remains internally consistent and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable and distinctive, with a lyrical yet controlled cadence that suits Liora’s sensibility and the story’s metaphysics. Diction choices (“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless,” “luminous absence”) are coherent with the narrative’s poetic register and feel like the narrator’s natural idiom rather than imposed rhetoric. The modulation under pressure—shorter, more declarative lines as the penumbra lunges and the wings rise—shows good rhythmic control. There’s minimal explanatory overreach; the voice largely trusts image and implication to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent, with strong rhythmic variation and a clear perceptual signature (“frequency just below hunger,” “book tumbled…to reveal a map of a boy’s palm”). Lyric compression is used confidently without becoming opaque; the pattern of metaphor is taught early and maintained. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the narrator’s knowledge tracks Elias’s experience. The only ceilinging factor is occasional near-overrichness of imagery that might crowd the emotional beat if pushed further.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lyric texture that matches the metaphysical premise and the tutor’s reflective mind. Chess language and tactile attention to threads and metal give the narration a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the girl’s line, which reframes his past abandonment as invitation rather than accusation. At times the diction verges on uniformly elevated, but it remains coherent for this mode and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fixation on bone, breath, and refracted sound/light. Diction and syntax feel unified with Liora’s sensibility—sensory, metaphor-rich, skeptical of the elders’ language. The narrative distance stays stable; we never head-hop or get knowledge that contradicts her perspective. Rhythm modulates well between slower, atmospheric lines and tighter, urgent sentences as she climbs and carves.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature: attention to wounds, corrosion, and intricate objects mirrors the alchemist’s craft and psyche. Rhythm and syntax vary intentionally to manage pressure, with short lines (“The third key was the one that mattered.” “And then—”) punctuating longer, baroque sentences. The choice to have the alchemist narrate aloud to the void is a sharp POV move that externalizes inner stakes without breaking distance or plausibility in this stylized world. A few formulations lean toward familiar abstraction, but overall the voice feels distinctive and sure-footed.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that matches Elias’s sensibility as a painter and mourner, with patterned phrases like “where the water forgets to move” reinforcing the mythic mood. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative distance stays steady; the quiet omniscient touches about the villagers are brief and coherent. Compression and elision (e.g., “That’s when he took the wrong turn”) are purposeful and legible. The only minor constraint is that the high lyricism flattens variation in psychic distance; there’s little raw, unvarnished thought under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Elias notices vibration, scent, and subtle shifts in people. Diction and rhythm feel consistent with the character and world while achieving a sophisticated texture; metaphors (e.g., the knife “screaming” in its precision) are precise rather than showy. POV remains steady on Elias, and the small amount of dialogue carries status dynamics and subtext efficiently. The modulation from tense attentiveness to quietly assured closure is smooth and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a lyrical yet controlled texture that fits Lena’s introspective, haunted mindset. Diction choices like “patchwork navigator,” “maps of reverse migrations,” and “divining rod” feel character-suitable and not generically writerly. Dialogue is spare but effective, carrying subtext (“Midnight calls were never for the living”; “The way back”) and advancing stakes. Psychic distance is well modulated, moving smoothly between sensory detail and reflective summary without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature—sensory-rich, slightly ceremonial, but grounded in Lior’s expertise and trauma. Syntax and rhythm are well modulated, with lyrical density that doesn’t tip into confusion, and the occasional interior line (“Pattern recognition was survival now.”) feels organic to his mindset. POV remains tight and trustworthy; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. The elevated diction is right at the edge of what this character can plausibly think in, but his bookishness and archivist connection make it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that feels tailored to Elias’s sensibility—attuned to absences, subtle shifts, and maritime minutiae. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with images like “jars of preserved storms” and “bottles of shipwreck sand” establishing a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance holds steady; we never slip into knowledge Elias couldn’t plausibly infer. The lyricism remains legible and rarely drifts into self-conscious ornament, supporting a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a tactile, slightly archaic lexicon that fits an antique map dealer. Rhythm and syntax vary well, letting lush, winding sentences carry wonder while shorter beats handle pressure (“He exhaled, slow.”). The few spoken lines are spare but effective, carrying subtext (the woman’s “Took you long enough”). Overall, the voice feels singular rather than generic, without slipping into self-conscious ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically consistent, and clearly anchored in the queen’s sensibility, with phrases like “her slippers silent on the cobalt stone” and “the weight of a throne too heavy for mortal hands” doing character and tonal work at once. The narration balances grandeur with specific, somewhat bitter intimacy, especially in her reaction to the trade she’s making. There’s no head-hopping and the psychic distance remains stable even as it flexes slightly to accommodate mythic phrasing. The only minor constraint is a near-uniform high lyric register, which, while effective, leaves little modulation for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent: lush, metaphor-rich, and firmly lodged in Elias’s perception with seamless free-indirect shading. Dialogue is spare but carries goal and subtext—Liora pushing him to reframe density, his request “Tell me again,” her “Took you long enough.” The lyric mode is taught from the first line and maintained without head-hopping or register breaks. Occasionally the diction leans toward self-conscious lyricism, yet it remains legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive—lyric yet controlled—with sharp phrases like “time was a wound, and they were just the scabs picking at it” signaling a consistent perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext about control and disillusionment (“Then be the one who burns the scrolls”). The narrative distance stays stable despite temporal weirdness; we never lose track of whose experience we inhabit. Rhythm and diction modulate well around peak beats (the burning, the scream, the empty grave) without slipping into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person POV through Elias is stable and convincing, with a calm, observant narrative voice that matches his temperament and profession. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with lyrical but mostly unforced sentences and clean psychic distance. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, revealing the woman’s need without overexplaining. The brief meta-phrases (“This was how he humanized the unspoken”) are the only moments that slightly flatten the otherwise strong integration of voice and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature built from weather, tools, and bodily memory. Syntax and rhythm modulate well: longer, lush sentences for description and concept, shorter ones for hinge beats (“They *bloomed*.” “They *sang*.”). The diction is elevated but feels congruent with Lian’s contemplative, ritual mindset rather than imposed from outside. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional aphoristic line reads as a natural extension of her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture that fits the premise (music, rumor, and magic all echo in the diction). Dialogue feels natural yet heightened, and character voices are distinct—Elias’s dry “You could’ve just said sorry” grounds Mara’s metaphor-laden speech. The narrative stance doesn’t over-explain; it trusts images and lets the reader infer emotional undercurrents. A few lines flirt with authorly neatness, but overall the POV control and rhythmic modulation under pressure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and well-suited to the metaphysical subject matter, with patterned phrases (“the universe breathed”) paying off at closure. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with a clear perceptual signature focused on language, embodiment, and cosmology rather than generic fantasy description. There is some risk of the voice smoothing the witness into a type rather than a person, but it maintains coherence and doesn’t slip into explanatory omniscience. POV distance and tense remain stable, and the single disembodied “voice” folds cleanly into the established narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, with a distinct texture—lyric yet grounded, full of precise metaphors that match Elias’s technical, ritualistic worldview. The diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate well as pressure rises (notably through the clipped countdown and sensory shifts as the water turns black). POV remains clean and character-bound, with no head-hopping or authorial intrusions. A few elevated phrases (“eminently peculiar,” “Conceptual repricing”-adjacent thought) lightly brush the edge of ornament, but they are still coherent with the quasi-bureaucratic, speculative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct: technical and pattern-minded yet capable of lyric perception, which suits an ex-security engineer haunted by unregistered signals. Diction and syntax are controlled and varied, with images like “familiar strangers” and “living circuit board” giving the prose a memorable texture. Dialogue, though sparse, feels natural and character-specific, especially Elias’s understated, urgent “They’re talking to each other.” Psychic distance is well-managed, keeping us inside Lena’s perceptions without slipping into omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct blend of mathematical vocabulary and lyric perception that feels true to Lila. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the narrative stance doesn’t wobble into head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. Occasional thesis-like sentences still sound like something this character could think, maintaining POV plausibility. The modulation from wry rationalism to numinous wonder by the end is smooth and under control.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct textural pattern (electric thrum, ghostly overtones, liquid constellation) that feels suited to Elias’s sensibility. Third-person close is stable, and brief dips into backstory are well anchored in present stimuli. Dialogue sounds natural yet heightened enough to match the tone; Elias’s wry, weary cadence contrasts cleanly with the caller’s tentative, haunted responses. A few lines verge on purple, but they don’t disrupt distance or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent lyric texture—metaphor-laden but controlled—and aligns with the archivist’s contemplative, ritualistic mindset. Diction and rhythm are coherent throughout, with some lovely turns (“turning the water the color of old parchment”). Psychic distance and tense remain stable; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The one limitation is a near-uniform register and cadence, which flattens modulation slightly across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, specific, and tonally consistent—lyric but not purple, with memorable turns like “slow-motion earthquake that had hollowed out the town” and “NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY.” Third-person limited Lena is stable, with occasional lightly omniscient framing that feels stylistically intentional rather than sloppy. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (Lena’s “reciprocity” correction; Carter’s “the cure is just a list of names”). The perceptual signature—pragmatic, wry, attuned to systems and ledgers—fits her role as a logistician and underwrites the prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly tuned to a non-visual sensorium, giving the narration a strong perceptual signature. Lyricism is controlled; metaphors (sound as light through water, languages as tastes) feel of a piece with Elian’s world and state. Psychic distance remains stable and apt, with no head-hopping or register slips. The modulation from dense, incantatory middle to slightly more spacious, accepting closing cadence supports the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a signal interpreter and empiricist-philosopher. Metaphors (unbending moments, history as editing, vellum drinking ink like roots) feel of a piece with his profession and stakes rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both cosmic-scale description and intimate interior shifts without confusion. There is no POV leakage or awkward register drift; the narrative confidence matches the contemplative, speculative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice with lyric omniscient overtones is consistent and controlled, with a distinctive texture of synesthetic and sound/silence imagery. Elias’s mute signing and Liora’s smoky, whispering presence are cleanly rendered without head-hopping, and the narrative distance feels appropriate to the mythic-lyric mode. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, carrying subtext and tactical shifts (“You don’t get to keep them” as a line of attack, not exposition). Rhythm modulates well between languid early sentences and tighter beats in the confrontation without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with images and diction that feel plausibly tied to a mind steeped in archives and art (“volcanic tenderness,” “the most dangerous art was the kind that survived”). The narrative maintains a steady, elegiac register that modulates into sharper, tenser rhythms around key actions (“He lit a match.”). There’s no POV leakage or over-explanation; reflection and observation are tightly braided. Occasionally the loftiness risks uniformity, but it doesn’t slide into abstraction or break character.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lira’s sensibility, with a strong rhythmic control that matches emotional intensity. Diction and metaphors (“vault of auroral sorrow,” “stolen constellations”) feel of a piece and avoid register drift, and there’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. The modulation from dirge-like to lullaby-like tone at the end is handled via image rather than explanation. It’s a distinctive and confident voice, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistent, mixing precise observation with striking metaphors (“a person’s walk was a confession”) that feel rooted in Lior’s way of perceiving. POV distance is well-controlled, with no leakage or unearned omniscience, and the small amount of dialogue is clean, natural, and subtext-laden. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense lyric description and more straightforward action. The voice feels distinct enough that small further differentiation between narrative diction and the woman’s could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in images like “the canal’s breath” and “carried his father’s silence like a second skin.” Psychic distance stays steady in a close third that occasionally brushes omniscience but always feels of a piece with the story’s fable-like register. Dialogue is sparse, age-appropriate, and subtextual, advancing pressure rather than explaining it. Rhythmic control—alternating longer, sinuous sentences with clipped beats like “She didn’t turn. Instead, she began to weave.”—supports the still yet tense atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and lyrically patterned in a way that fits both the magical-realist elements and Elias’s contemplative temperament. Metaphors like “mist…like a bruise” and “breath curling like question marks” feel authored but consistent with the established narrative idiom. Psychic distance stays within a close-ish external focalization on Elias without head-hopping, and the minimal dialogue sounds natural for adults and children in this tone. A few theme-forward sentences edge toward authorial commentary, yet they don’t fracture POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture in its metaphors (“salt-stiffened ropes biting into his palms like old grudges,” “fog curled thick as regret”). POV access stays cleanly with Elias, and the narration’s elevated diction feels consonant with a mythic, fable-like register rather than imposed. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and sharper punches around key turns (“He didn’t jump. He unfolded”). Occasional grand statements brush up against abstraction, but they don’t break the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical without sacrificing clarity, and tied to Lena’s sensibility. Metaphors like “blades cutting the sky into rhythmic slices of silence” and “confetti for a funeral no one attended” feel character-filtered rather than generic. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with Harkin’s gruntiness and Lena’s dry, slightly theatrical wit clearly differentiated. Psychic distance is well managed, tightening at the scream and relaxing into a gentler, more open cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically controlled, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elira’s sensibility as a “cloud-shadow poet.” Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful; the prose modulates from hushed, elongated sentences to sharper shifts as the lake and atrium respond. Imagery (“lantern-moth hush,” “verses stitched from the ephemeral”) feels character-specific rather than generic fantasy diction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the slightly elevated register fits both setting and character.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, marked by tactile and auditory attention instead of visual color, which feels true to Elias. Sentence rhythm modulates nicely between compressed lyric description and quieter, plainer beats around gesture and signing. Dialogue is spare but natural and layered with subtext, especially in the plant-code exchanges and the old woman’s remarks. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the lyricism feels character-rooted rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Liora’s sensibility—attuned to sound, light, and subtle shifts in atmosphere. Third-person close POV holds steady without leakage, and the cadence modulates well between descriptive lushness and quieter, more distilled lines at key moments. Phrasing like “the sound of *between*” or “powerfully gentle” gives the piece a distinctive texture without collapsing into abstraction. A touch more variation in sentence rhythm at peak beats could heighten contrast, but overall the voice feels confident and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and particular to Lena’s sensibility as a maker; observations about metal, wire, and light feel like her way of thinking. Rhythm and diction are controlled and modulate with emotion (quieter, denser near the funeral-grief, more open in the teaching passages). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the sparse dialogue at the end fits the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its fusion of occult, financial, and urban registers. Syntax and rhythm vary well, from lush descriptive openings to tighter lines around dialogue and action. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-specific (her guarded skepticism versus his calm, aphoristic responses). The lyric sensibility never loses track of scene or perspective, and POV remains cleanly anchored in Elias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly archaic diction well-matched to the material. The perceptual signature—obsession with time, light, and decay—feels specific to this historian and her vocation. Rhythm is varied and generally controlled; long, sinuous sentences carry atmosphere without collapsing into sludge. Occasionally the register leans into high-flown abstraction, but it remains coherent and legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Liora’s way of noticing; diction choices like “softly deliberate” and “dusk noticer” feel coherent rather than arbitrary. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with a good mix of short, charged lines and more sinuous sentences that suit the contemplative mode. The narrator’s slight omniscient reach (into the poet’s past, the curator’s intent) remains consistent with the story’s mythic tone and doesn’t create head-hopping. Voice is distinctive enough for literary publication, though it does lean on a couple of repeated phrases as tonal anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elias notices bodies, wounds, and textures. Syntax and rhythm vary well, supporting both atmosphere and interior tension. Occasional figurative flourishes (“a jagged absence like a half-told lie”) feel character-coherent rather than authorially imposed. POV remains stable and modest in what it claims to know, with dialogue sparse but natural.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a strong perceptual signature: Liora interprets everything—stone, plants, files—through rings, scars, and wounds. Diction and rhythm modulate effectively, from dense image clusters to more measured declaratives at key realizations, and the speculative elements are fully naturalized into her interiority. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative confidence matches what she could plausibly infer. The only thing keeping this short of exceptional is occasional over-saturation of metaphor that edges toward authorial rather than character-anchored patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature built around film, light, and temporal metaphors. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional; long, lush sentences at reflective moments are balanced by shorter, cutting lines at turns (“It wasn’t a place. / It was a when.”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the mild omniscient tilt around the projection booth still reads as Elara-colored. The voice sustains intensity without drifting into self-conscious cleverness.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Liora’s sensibility—constellations, auroras, and musical metaphors dominate her way of seeing. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanically patterned, with well-timed short emphatic lines (“She followed.” / “She began to sing.”). The tonal and lexical register stays stable, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the narration edges into slightly generic uplift, but overall the voice is distinctive and well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a consistent mythic cadence (“He had a job to do. / The train rolled on...”). POV control is clean and modest; we never slip into knowledge Hollow couldn’t plausibly have beyond the story’s metaphysical frame. Some turns of phrase flirt with familiar speculative-poetic rhetoric, but overall the perceptual signature—train-minded, time-haunted, gently astonished—is distinct enough to feel authored.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a confident, lyrical register that matches the story’s metaphysical ambitions. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and the diction (mechanical-organic hybrids, sensory metaphors) creates a distinct perceptual signature aligned with the philosopher’s sixth sense. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance is consistently intimate yet slightly elevated. A few abstract formulations thin immediacy, but they don’t materially disturb voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well suited to the liminal setting, with metaphors that mostly feel rooted in Liora’s sensibility as a guide (“lantern swinging like a metronome,” “path twisted like a held breath”). Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially in the exchange about courage and waiting where much is implied. Narrative distance modulates smoothly between close interior and wider atmospheric observation without confusion. A few aphoristic turns feel slightly more authorial than character-bound but don’t significantly break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident and distinctive, with controlled lyricism (“seraphically mundane,” “tuneless, frostbitten hope of a sound”) and a stable close third centered on Elias. The diction occasionally brushes the ornate but mostly stays coherent with the gothic-fantastical register the piece establishes from the opening line. POV control is firm; we do not slip inside the pianist’s mind beyond observable cues, and the narrative’s mild omniscient tilt reads consistent rather than leaky. Rhythmic variation and carefully chosen metaphors support the atmosphere without obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct—elevated but not pompous, with metaphors that feel tuned to this world and this ageless, stone-bodied observer. Rhythm and syntax shift appropriately between description, reflection, and climactic action, and there is no head-hopping. The sparse dialogue is clean and tonally apt, with the pretender’s line undercutting expectation. A slight sense of authorial lyricism occasionally overtakes Veythas’s specific sensibility, but not enough to damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with a measured, tidal rhythm that suits a patient observer of the sea. Diction and imagery (gauges as metronomes, the sky “remembered how to be blue”) feel plausibly within Lena’s contemplative, scientifically adjacent lexicon. Voss’s brief dialogue is functional and in-character, and the narrative never slips into unearned omniscience. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the end, moving from descriptive to immediate as she feels the rhythm through her bones.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)

Rhythm and syntax are well controlled, modulating smoothly from quiet observation to crescendo as the bay awakens. POV boundaries are clean and there is no head-hopping; even brief glimpses of the scout are strictly external. The prose achieves a confident texture that would sit comfortably in an elite market.

Rhythm and syntax modulate well between long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter lines around key choices. Occasional clinical terms (“somatic,” “trauma therapist”) sit just on the edge of her plausible lexicon but are justified by the backstory and don’t jar the overall voice. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience, and the reflective stance suits the story’s accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically charged, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with rhetorical questions and tactile perceptions tying emotion to image. Rhythm and syntax modulate reasonably well with pressure, leaning more incantatory as she surrenders to the dark. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator doesn’t over-explain what images already convey. At times the register feels slightly more abstract/poetic than an individual mind would under strain, but the piece teaches and sustains that mode.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism with phrases like “time stretched thin, like a bowstring about to snap” and “serene anger, the kind that didn’t shout but carved rivers through stone.” POV is stable and access to Kael’s perceptions remains consistent. There are a few moments where the diction feels a hair more authorial than character-bound, but not enough to break immersion. Rhythm and sentence variety mostly support tension and imagery well.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly baroque lyricism that fits the gothic-technological setting. Cadence and sentence length modulate well around key beats (the command input, the alarms, the guns).

There’s no POV leakage or register drift; figurative language feels controlled and character-appropriate. The voice is strong and memorable, though not so idiosyncratic as to feel utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctly filtered through this fisher’s sensory and professional biases (nets, knots, pulses, frequencies), giving the prose a strong perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with patterned images (breath, hum, sleepwalking stars, silence as active) that feel intentional rather than ornamental. There’s no head-hopping or stance slippage; even cosmological observations read as extensions of his long practice with the garden. A few phrases (“the kind that…”) recur as a cadence tic, but they generally serve emphasis rather than feeling like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how it filters the world through Lior’s artistic and socially observant sensibility. Rhythms modulate effectively—shorter, sharper lines around the tile’s burning and void-opening contrast with more sinuous descriptive passages. Occasional camera-wide remarks (“no one alive remembered…”) feel smoothly integrated rather than like clumsy omniscient drift. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and controlled enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture—confident, rhythmic, and internally consistent with Elias’s reflective, wounded intelligence. Diction and syntax are controlled, with patterned parentheticals and parallel structures that feel purposeful rather than mannered. Dialogue is sparse but effective; the commander’s roughness against Elias’s steady, quiet courage reads naturally even within an elevated register. POV remains steady and legible throughout, with no head-hopping or unjustified elision.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice through Lydia is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (tastes-of-sounds, stage metaphors, sensory crossings). Brief dialogue is natural and economical, advancing pressure rather than explaining it. The narrative stance walks a fine line between her consciousness and a lightly omniscient framing (“It was always like this”) without slipping into confusing head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax are well modulated: lush but controlled, with cadences that support the accumulating enchantment rather than blur it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—wry, sensory, slightly scientific but still lyrical (“believed in gravity but not in gravity’s intentions”). Diction and metaphor feel like extensions of Lena’s artistic, skeptical mind rather than authorial ornament, and psychic distance tightens appropriately as she activates the sliver and confronts the door. There are no POV leaks or unjustified omniscient intrusions; even Mira’s “voice” is rendered via Lena’s sensory-experiential frame. Rhythmic modulation between clipped beats and longer, looping sentences supports both tension and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and internally consistent, with distinctive turns like “factually mystical” and the clinical-poetic heat-map lexicon grounding the perspective. The third-person close focalization stays tight to Lior’s perceptions without leaking into authorial omniscience. Rhythm varies well between longer, sensuous sentences and sharper pivots at key beats (the fossil heating, the wrist display flaring, the cave’s response). There is a mild tension between elevated diction and the implied practicality of a field worker, but it reads as a stylized consciousness rather than a register slip.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in craft and material (“fossilized resin that glowed faintly in the dark like trapped sunlight,” “jars of preserved whispers”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled and purposeful, modulating between more expansive description at the start and tighter, charged lines near the well and at closure. The narrative never over-explains beyond what Elias could reasonably infer, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shifts.

The voice sustains its texture under emotional pressure without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)

There are no POV leaks or unexplained shifts, and the elevated language remains coherent with the story’s quasi-mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in touch, sound, and absence rather than sight. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied; metaphor and sentence length modulate with emotional pressure. The sparse bits of direct speech (“You were looking for something,” “Liora”) are apt and understated, allowing the prose to carry subtext. Overall the POV feels both intimate and slightly mythic without slipping in and out of distance incoherently.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (scientific but slightly mystical, fixated on maps, pressure, and sky). Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate well between tense action (“He pressed the nail to the glass—and the air ripped.”) and quieter reflection.

The elevated diction matches the mythic-toned premise well enough to avoid major register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with diction that fits a reflective, observant protagonist who grew up around crime and later navigated corporate spaces. Sentences vary pleasingly in length and cadence, and metaphors feel aligned with the character’s sensibility (money as territorial markers, fear as currency). There’s no POV leakage or explanatory narrator; the perspective stays grounded in Elias’s perceptions and inherited language. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top is occasional phrasing that edges toward authorial aphorism rather than remaining fully character-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and stable, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s craft and obsessions (ink, constellations, inscriptions).

Rhythm and diction (“fruit that tasted like forgiveness,” “shadows that moved like old lovers”) create a distinctive texture that holds under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, with clear status difference between Veyra and Liora and no head-hopping. The voice modulates effectively from incantatory in the ritual to quieter, cleaner in the dawn scene, enhancing the sense of shift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in sound, gear, and textures of work. Diction and rhythm are controlled—sentences modulate nicely between lyric and concrete, and the small bits of dialogue feel natural, distinct from the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—precise metaphors (“embarrassed by its own luminosity,” “a name slipping from the tongue of a dying man”) and syntax that reflects a patient, analogical thinker. Psychic distance is well modulated: the narration can step out for conceptual framing without breaking the coherence of Elias’s perspective. Dialogue, though brief, is natural and character-specific, adding warmth and history. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the voice under stress (during the tilt and reunion) remains consistent while tightening rhythm appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice around Elias is stable and confident, with a distinctive lyric texture that matches his role and world. Imagery (e.g., “glass ceiling fractaling dawn,” “compass needle that always pointed inward”) feels like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person, lightly lyrical voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“damp, electric air,” “resonant hush”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between short, weighty lines and more flowing descriptive sentences, especially around the pearl moment and the emergence. There is some repetition of rhetorical structures (“Not a weapon. / A crown.”) that feels intentional and effective rather than mechanical. The brief radio dialogue is minimal but clean and serves as a sharp tonal counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tethered to Elias’s perceptions; his professional bias toward rivers and maps shapes what he notices and how he phrases it. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a measured, elegiac cadence that tightens around key beats (“Not forgiveness. Not yet. But a beginning.”). There is no dialogue to test, but internal narration carries subtext and emotional shading without over-explaining. The only small limitation is that a few cadences (“Some chronicler he was.”) brush stylistic familiarity rather than utterly distinctive idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“her breath curling like ink in the damp air”) that feels coherent with the dreamlike premise. POV is stable and modest; we only know what she can infer or glimpse via the watch, and temporal slippages are well signposted by concrete cues (the watch’s motion, the chime). Rhythm modulates nicely—slow and lush in the opening, clipped and urgent during the collapse, then calmer and declarative in the waking-world coda. The prose feels confident and intentional throughout without sliding into self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility and lexicon, with no POV leakage.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s sensibility (ritualized descriptions of the lamp, sensitivity to chime patterns, guilt as textile). Rhythm and syntax are well controlled; the narration modulates into more spacious, contemplative lines as he opens to doubt. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the woman’s brief lines carrying subtext about shared burden.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (botanical and geological metaphors, bodily awareness, pattern-attuned noticing).

The elevated diction fits both character and venue, with no jarring register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically controlled, and clearly filtered through the skimmer’s sensibility—obsessed with resonance, pulses, and bone. Syntax modulates well with pressure, tightening toward the Maw’s approach and softening into the final poised stillness. There’s no head-hopping, and the diction stays within an elevated but coherent register for this mythic-feeling world. It’s distinctive and sure-footed, if not so idiosyncratic as to feel utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice carries a distinct texture—lyric but not overwrought, with recurring attention to light, fissures, and institutional judgment that feels character-specific. POV is stable and confident; we never slip into knowledge Marlin can’t plausibly infer, and brief authorial tilts (“of course”) are consistent with his internal commentary. Dialogue is spare yet purposeful, with the gardener’s dry, unfinished tone contrasting the deans’ clipped demand for a “mechanism,” and it advances both plot and theme. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately between the harsh ascent, the lush garden, and the wry Conservatory confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)

POV is steady, with no head-hopping, and the one use of signed dialogue from the figure is handled clearly and in keeping with the piece’s quiet, image-driven style. The narrator’s certainty stays within what Elias can perceive or infer, preserving distance control even in the surreal door sequence. Rhythm modulates well between slower, descriptive passages and the more charged central vision.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical-analytic texture that fits a pattern-obsessed observer at the end of everything. Rhythmic control is strong: short, declarative lines (“The static wasn’t noise. / It was a voice…”) punctuate longer, more sinuous sentences for emphasis. The cosmic register and metaphoric diction feel coherent with Liora’s sensibility rather than imposed from outside. A few formulations (“purpose that had always pulled her forward”) read slightly generic compared to the best sentences, keeping this just below the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—dense metaphor, long sentences modulated with short hammer blows—that suits a reaper’s detached yet intimate perception. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with recurring textures around light, bone, ink, and echoes that feel patterned rather than repetitive. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the rare bits of quoted speech (Leviathan, atlas) are tonally coherent with the world. The one mild limitation is that the elevated register remains fairly uniform, with little modulation to reflect spikes in stress.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinct, with metaphors that feel native to Elias’s worldview (water, stone, resonance, breath).

Rhythm modulates nicely from contemplative to more propulsive during the bell-striking and bay-awakening sequence. The voice is polished and confident enough to carry a quasi-mythic tone without tipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with persistent water and light imagery that feels like his mind’s idiom rather than generic ornament. Syntax and rhythm vary well, creating a contemplative cadence that tightens around key beats (unscrewing the cap, nailing and burning photographs, letting the bottle sink). There is no head-hopping or register drift; reflective passages remain anchored in present stimuli (scents, objects, landmarks). The final modulation into future intention (“Dawn would find him…”) feels like an earned, controlled widening of perspective rather than an expository intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a clear perceptual signature: sensory-rich, slightly archaic diction that fits the quasi-mythic frame. Rhythm and syntax are varied and generally well-controlled, with a good balance between long, flowing sentences and sharper beats at key moments (“Then the flame turned blue.”). The narrative stance stays inside her sensibility while allowing elevated metaphor. Occasionally the register drifts toward abstract commentary, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly colored by Elara’s pattern-oriented, sensory-attuned mind. Lexicon and syntax are lyrically elevated but consistent, with recurring concern for sound, silence, and weight that feels like her perceptual signature rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer in peak beats (the jump, the landing) without any POV leakage. With no conventional dialogue to test, the piece still shows strong rhythmic and tonal modulation tied to emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and textured, blending SF-fantasy diction (“Schism,” “Emperor’s historians”) with tactile, concrete images (“moss-slicked edges humming,” brains pulsing in amber fluid). POV is stable and close enough to Kael to give his perceptions weight without slipping into exposition-heavy explanation. Dialogue is functional and often sharp, especially Veyra’s blunt lines, though at times it edges toward epigrammatic neatness (“case is moot,” “truth sliced through their pretense”). Overall, the voice feels distinct and controlled, with only minor moments of self-conscious flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and slightly lyrical, with metaphors that feel native to Elias (doors, puzzles, water, time) and to the setting. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, especially Lina’s email and her “Some doors don’t open until you stop knocking.” The narrator never over-explains or cheats POV knowledge, and the tonal modulation from wry to reverent is controlled. It stops short of a truly idiosyncratic, unmistakable voice, but is well above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with metaphors (“ghost of a thousand leaf blowers,” “mournfully eager”) that feel character-specific rather than generic. Psychic distance is well-controlled, drifting in for reflection and out for sensory specificity without confusion. Limited dialogue at the end is simple but natural, and the shift into a slightly lighter register there works as a tonal modulation rather than a break in voice. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience undermining the stance.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Lyssa-filtered, with a strong perceptual signature (books as homesick, mist inhaling, ground as a breathing page). Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, with purposeful repetition and variation that suit the foggy lucidity. Dialogue is minimal but atmospheric and in keeping with the surreal tone. There’s occasional flirtation with familiar spooky-fantasy diction, but it doesn’t undermine the distinctness of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent sensory palette and metaphorical logic suited to an undersea navigator. Elira’s perception shapes diction (edges, currents, paths) and gives the prose a distinct texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, with Kael’s blunt skepticism contrasting Elira’s more metaphorical language. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the lyricism rarely overreaches into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with textured yet controlled lyricism (“a voice, thin as spider silk, threaded through decades of static”) that clearly belongs to this character’s perception. The rhythm modulates nicely between longer, image-rich sentences and clipped beats at moments of pressure (“He stumbled, the hearing aid slipping— / —and the world went silent.”). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext and moving the plot without expository strain. There are minor repetitions of phrasing and a slight tendency toward similar figurative structures, but they don’t significantly blur the distinct narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature—Elias notices seams, forgotten experiments, and the “ghost of data,” which suits his obsession. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between compressed, high-pressure moments and more expansive lyric passages without losing clarity. The diction (“crashing hush,” “phase transition,” “unremembered”) feels unified and character-appropriate for a seasoned explorer of liminal spaces.

There’s a distinct perceptual signature without feeling mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (“the grit of consonants… the silk of vowels”) and consistent psychic distance. Rhythm modulates well, moving from languid description into tighter, harsher lines as the canyon awakens (“the sound of a blade dragged across old wounds”). The narrator’s certainty stays within what this mythic register can plausibly know, and the occasional italicized words (“*inhale*,” “*all*”) are effective emphasis rather than gimmick. There are no POV slips or register jolts undermining the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinct, blending academic precision (“cryptid researcher”) with lush, uncanny diction (“gravitationally playful,” “harmony untamed,” parenthetical asides). POV remains cleanly centered on Elias’s experiential frame, with occasional omniscient-tinged flourishes that feel stylistically intentional rather than sloppy. The patterned parentheticals and refrain-like constructions (“some stories…,” “some lessons…”) give the voice a recognizable signature while staying legible.

Syntax and rhythm modulate nicely, giving weight to key beats (“The ground shivered.”; “The trees leaned in.”) without slipping into confusion or head-hopping.

POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping, and the occasional quoted line from Voss or his mother carries distinct idiom. Rhythm is well-managed, alternating longer, meditative sentences with sharper turns at key beats (“The air thickened.” / “Elias exhaled.”).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature rooted in someone who works with books, film, and light. Metaphors are tailored to her sensibility (saltwind as parchment, ink ghosts, film trays) rather than generic poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)

Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences flexing between long, image-rich lines and sharper beats at moments of realization (“He knew then: the thief had returned.”). Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the memory eater’s single line carrying a cold, glassy menace in contrast to Elias’s steady, wry reply.

Technical diction (sonar ping, entanglement, bending of spacetime) blends smoothly with more poetic imagery, and the distance control never wavers into head-hopping or authorial intrusion. A few sentences are quite elevated, but they remain consistent with a reflective, highly literate focalizer and don’t break the spell.

Rhythm modulates well, slowing for contemplative beats and tightening at the climax without losing clarity.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Liora’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control (“The spire had always been cold. / But cold, she decided, was just the price of seeing clearly.”). Diction and imagery choices (bones, lenses, broken promises, burned ice) form a coherent, distinctive texture without POV leakage. There is no dialogue to test, but interiority and narration stay aligned and confident, with no unmotivated register jumps. The lyricism is high but generally controlled enough not to obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s poetic-scientific mind; diction like “quiet explosions,” “spooled wholeness,” and “dusty starlight” feels like his way of thinking. Rhythm varies well, mixing long, sinuous sentences with shorter declaratives at key beats (“He had been waiting for this.” “It was a surrender.”).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)

Her perceptual biases (seeing maps in bird flight, clouds as ink, light as “stranded luminance”) create a distinct narrative flavor without drifting into abstraction. Dialogue is clean, efficient, and character-appropriate; Veyra’s shift in tone is communicated with minimal but effective lines. The voice is strong and controlled, if not singular enough yet to feel unmistakably idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)

Diction and rhythm match Liora’s long, obsessive attention to the labyrinth and orchard, and the narrative distance remains steady without head-hopping. Compression of years into a few sentences reads purposeful, not expository, and the single line of dialogue from the girl is spare and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, marrying technical diction (“carbon weaves,” “polymer chains,” “biodegradable scaffolds”) with lyrical, musical metaphors in a way that feels true to a mathematically minded, grieving scientist. POV control is solid, with no leakage beyond Elias’s perceptions except in the girl’s brief, simply rendered dialogue, which provides a grounded counterpoint. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the voice modulates from analytic to more open and sensory as his grief loosens. A few familiar phrases (“pieces fall into place”) momentarily flatten the otherwise strong signature.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited POV around Liora is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature that favors tactile and luminous details over abstract summary.

Diction (“lucid turbulence,” “transposed empathy,” “characters that resembled constellations mid-collapse”) is elevated yet coherent with the fantastical register, and the narration’s confidence about what’s happening stays anchored in Elias’s experience. The modulation from dense, humming description to a clearer, quieter cadence at the end (“Elias laughed, the sound strange and unborrowed…”) tracks his internal shift. There’s very little dialog to test speech distinction, but the widow’s quoted line feels tonally distinct enough.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in tactile and sonic imagery (trembling fingers, humming pendant, exhaling abyss). Third-person limited holds steady while allowing occasional, controlled omniscient touches (“The villagers would call it an echo. The courier knew better”) that feel purposeful and thematic rather than sloppy.

It was a weapon.”). The diction matches the mythic, post-technological tone and stays coherent without head-hopping or register slips. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, weaving observation, interiority, and world-scale statements. It’s strong enough for serious consideration, though the voice doesn’t yet reach the utterly unmistakable, formally daring level that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (obsession with light, color, texture) that clearly belongs to a dye master shaped by both craft and transplanted heart.

Diction (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows,” “frostbitten leather”) feels unified and character-appropriate for someone steeped in arcane records. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance tightens nicely as Elias approaches the door and bridge. The prose texture is distinct enough to feel like a particular sensibility rather than generic fantasy voice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinct, with sensory-rich diction that matches Lena’s wary, streetwise perspective. POV distance stays consistent in a close third that blends observation and interiority smoothly. Dialogue is economical, subtextual, and status-aware, particularly in the Veyne exchange. The prose texture feels unified and character-driven rather than generically lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, consistent, and richly textural, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in taste and charged metaphors. Rhythm and diction support the lyrical, speculative tone without major register slips, and psychic distance is well-modulated—close enough for sensory immediacy, slightly distant for mythic framing. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the few more abstract sentences still feel of a piece with Lira’s worldview. Overall, the narrative voice is distinctive and controlled enough for high-level literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility—obsessed with shadow, texture, and the feel of materials like charcoal and paint. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (locks, darkness, color) used to build a distinctive texture rather than generic lyricism. The voice modulates appropriately from somber, compressed grief to more expansive, incantatory cadence during the unlocking and painting. Occasionally, turns of phrase skirt the familiar (“the first bite of an apple”), but they don’t meaningfully break the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise, with consistent diction and a strong perceptual signature (organic metaphors tied to parchment, leaves, domes, poison, and breath). Syntax and rhythm modulate well between description, interiority, and action; the narrative stance never wobbles. There is no dialogue to test, but internal narration carries pressure and mood effectively. The voice feels distinct and controlled enough for upper-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound, vibration, and light; diction is consistent with a poetic but grounded sensibility. The narration maintains a stable distance and never overreaches beyond what Liora can plausibly perceive or infer. Rhythmic modulation is strong, especially around the shatter and the quiet aftermath. The voice feels confident and unified enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise yet grounded, with a consistent android sensibility (static, programming, metal bones) inflecting perception. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between contemplative description and sharper, decision-driven beats. There’s no head-hopping and no cheating omniscience; everything feels properly bound to Elias’s awareness. The controlled figurative language (“magnetic north drift like a loose screw in the planet’s core”) strengthens character and mood rather than floating as authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Mira is steady and confident, with occasional zoom-outs ("The courtyard held its breath") that feel like poetic extensions rather than head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled and lyrical—"first light of dawn spilled into the courtyard like a slow exhale" sets an immediate, consistent texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-distinguishing (Mrs. Delgado’s gossip vs. Old Man Chen’s humming), and quoted lines advance context and mood efficiently. The voice remains legible and coherent even in its more figurative stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in pattern, rhythm, and code. Syntax and diction support the meditative, mysterious tone without slipping into incoherence, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice distinction, but interior access and narrative stance stay stable. Occasional expository theme statements slightly flatten what is otherwise an effectively textured voice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with strong rhythmic control (“like a shadow with a flame,” “gleaming silence of the crystal chamber”). Diction and metaphors feel unified to the world (salt, gravity, excavation) and to his perceptual habits, with very little register drift or explanatory scaffolding. The narrative distance modulates well between lyric description and tighter interiority at peak beats (“Not his imagination—it lurched, as if something beneath him had taken a breath”). It stops just short of utterly idiosyncratic genius; the voice is excellent but not unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically confident, and saturated with a particular diction (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze”) that feels of a piece with the protagonist’s way of perceiving. Rhythm modulates well—longer, lush sentences in build-up, sharper beats around the “snap” and aftermath—without slipping into confusion. There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble; even the abstract moments feel anchored in her sensorium. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable while remaining legible.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending matter-of-fact narration with precise, uncanny images (“steam curling into the shapes of forgotten letters”). Psychic distance is consistent, with a close lean to Elias while allowing a lightly omniscient-seeming flourish or two around Veyra that still feel in-tone. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext and status (Veyra’s declarative “You want to learn it” versus Elias’s questions). The narrative rhythm—alternating compact sentences with slightly more baroque ones—supports the mysterious, slightly formal register without tipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a confident rhythm and strong metaphorical control that reflects Liora’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving from atmospheric description into tight interiority under stress without head-hopping. Diction choices (“quarantine of minds,” “resonance structures,” “memory keeper”) are distinctive yet coherent for the world. The few quasi-sloganish sentences at the end slightly smooth the idiosyncrasy of the voice, but not enough to disrupt its strength.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear perceptual signature centered on the forger yet comfortably shading into the Emperor’s responses. Syntax and rhythm vary in support of pressure, and the diction (“calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring”) feels unified rather than patchwork. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext (“You forged my hand, but never my heart”; “Teach me”) without over-explaining. The slight omniscient tilt in articulating thematic lines is noticeable but doesn’t break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct diction pattern that suits a canyon echo singer tuned to resonance and vibration. POV control is clean; we stay solidly in Veyra’s perception with no head-hopping, and the occasional omniscient-leaning phrasing still feels aligned with her heightened sensitivity. Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-specific, especially in the contrast between Kaelis’s reed-dry cynicism and the shell’s weighty, inhuman tone. There are a few meta-ish terms (“progressive disclosure”) that momentarily feel more editorial than character-voiced, but they don’t seriously disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice through Lena is consistent, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature centered on wreckage and salvage. Lyric sentences (“their voices the color of old silver,” “threads of borrowed starlight”) are controlled and modulate well with quieter declarative lines. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the widow’s and Lena’s speech distinct in rhythm and intention. A few aphoristic turns at the end lean more authorial than character-bound, but they don’t destabilize the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident and lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature focused on texture, pattern, and small labors. Dialogue sounds natural yet understated, with clear status dynamics (Kael’s gentle authority, Liora’s tentative questioning) and subtext about visibility and worth. The narrative diction is elevated but suits Kael’s “philosopher of knots” frame and doesn’t break POV plausibility. Modulation from serene observation to quietly charged wonder (around the minnows and shared whistle) is smooth and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and colored by Elias’s skeptical, pattern-attuned mind. Sentence rhythms vary, and key phrases ("The stillpoint pushed back. Not with force. With meaning.") show deliberate, effective modulation under pressure. The brief radio voice interjection feels distinct yet thematically of a piece with the narrative’s tone. There are a few slightly writerly flourishes that feel more authorial than strictly Elias-filtered, but not enough to break the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically heightened yet consistent, with a distinct prophetic texture that matches Elias’s mind and circumstances. Diction choices like “sold his name to the wind and his sleep to the static” and “You are the hinge, little god” feel unified and character-rooted rather than arbitrarily ornate. Snippets of “dialogue” from the static are effective, charged, and goal-directed, pushing him toward a decision. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual bias toward sound and texture. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, supporting the meditative tone without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, with a strong sensory bias toward sound and vibration that feels intrinsic to this character’s mind. Diction balances technical terms (“subsonic,” “resonator”) with poetic compression (“a beam of sound, shooting skyward like a reverse lightning strike”) without register clashes. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the turn of the key and during the unraveling, and there’s no POV leakage or cheap withholding. The main limiter is that the lyric intensity is held at a fairly steady level throughout, leaving slightly less modulation between quiet and peak than the very top tier pieces often manage.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on horizons, tension, and slow shifts (“a single breath of glass under the colorless dawn”). Syntax and rhythm vary well, modulating between short, weighty lines (“It was a pause. / A held breath.”) and more sinuous sentences without losing clarity. The diction fits both the mythic register of the world and Lior’s contemplative stance, and there are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions. The voice is distinct enough to feel publish-ready, even if it occasionally edges toward aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and effective, blending technical observation with haunted, sensorial language in a way that feels specific to Elias’s mind. Phrasing like “his pulse watchfully calm” and “whispers—not in his ears, but in his bones” shows good control of rhythm and psychic distance. The sparse dialogue is clean and natural, used only when needed to apply pressure or contrast institutional normalcy with Elias’s growing unease. The voice is strong rather than singularly unforgettable, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and well-matched to a reflective, spiritually literate chaplain; diction like “vibrant hush,” “its gears whispering like a confession,” and “ink bled into the paper like a promise” feels organic to him. Rhythm varies effectively between longer, contemplative sentences and short emphatic ones (“The rain didn’t let up. Neither did he.”). POV is stable with no leakage or unmotivated distance shifts. The lyricism is confident without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending technical-ish terms with strange lyricism in a way that feels like this particular world’s idiom. Phrases like “transliterated her doubts into something sharper” and “a compass for the already lost” show a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is steady: close enough to Pip’s worldview to feel colored by her, but with a slightly fable-like narratorial tilt that never confuses. There’s no dialogue to test, but the modulation of rhythm around key beats (leap, conducting, collapse) is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct techno-lyric texture and apt metaphors (“firewalls flaring like angry stars,” “ghost-light of a trillion forgotten posts”). The narrative distance stays controlled; we never leave Lena’s perceptual frame in a way that breaks POV, and the few lines of dialogue feel functional and in-tone. Occasional capitalizations and explanatory sentences slightly flatten the otherwise nimble voice. Overall, the prose stance is confident and cohesive, supporting both concept and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphor choices and rhythms. Diction and syntax feel of a piece with Elias’s contemplative, sensory-rich mindset; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift.

The modulation toward the end—shorter, more declarative beats around his decision—supports the closing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and carries a distinct perceptual signature—mixing maritime imagery with clinical self-knowledge in a way that feels specific to Lior. Syntax and rhythm are varied and often musical without losing clarity, e.g., “her bones humming with the same quiet frequency as the ice.” Free indirect style is clean; we never drift into others’ interiority. Occasionally the register slips toward essayistic aphorism, but not enough to break the spell or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close-third voice is stable and has a distinct texture—lyric, sensory, and colored by Lior’s earthbound perspective even when it reaches for celestial imagery via Mira. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences vary and the narrative distance tightens appropriately around key beats (the letter, the drawing, the final walk back into the vines). The few remembered bits of dialogue feel natural and differentiated from the narration. Occasionally the voice edges toward writerly elegance over character-anchored roughness, but it never breaks plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with strong rhythm and a distinct perceptual signature (conceptual metaphors like “the first word ever spoken” feel native to this consciousness). POV is stable and close enough to Lysan to feel her stance without head-hopping; the mysterious pavilion voice reads as diegetic, not a POV slip. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext about time, limitation, and commitment.

A few thematic sentences slip toward the authorial, but they don’t seriously disrupt the established POV texture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lucid, slightly elegiac lyricism that matches both character and concept. Diction and rhythm are deliberate (“a hush so profound it hummed,” “breath held before the next word”), and the narrative doesn’t wander outside what Elias can plausibly perceive or infer. Dialogue is spare but natural, with the woman’s roughness and hope reading distinct from the narrative texture. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around key beats (climbing, speaking into the crystal, the offer to join) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, blending Elias’s sensibility with an observant narrative in a way that feels unified and character-specific.

Psychic distance is well-controlled, tightening in key moments (“for the first time in years…”) without jarring shifts or head-hopping. The voice sustains its style under pressure without slipping into explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“wind carried the sound of leaves falling from trees that didn’t exist”; “luminous ache of a universe”). Third-person close on Elias is stable; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Lena’s, with metaphor and diction aligned to her sensibility as a music therapist steeped in hymns.

Rhythm modulates well between lush description and plainer, grounding lines (“The nurse will be in soon”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance shifts only to support emotional emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, with controlled rhythm, evocative metaphor (“stars pulsed like embers in a dying forge”), and consistent third-person-limited access to Elara. The automaton’s dialogue has a distinct texture that contrasts with Elara’s understated speech, reinforcing status and tone. The diction occasionally skirts purple but remains legible and character-appropriate, and psychic distance is handled smoothly through the scene. The voice effectively supports the blend of cosmic, academic, and slightly wry horror without slipping registers.

Diction and rhythm are consistent and confident, and the brief dialogue feels natural, distinct in age/tone, and subtextually aligned with theme.

Point of view remains stable and unconfused throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctly filtered through Lena’s sensibility—her attention to textures, patterns, and silence forms a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare, natural, and layered with subtext, allowing emotional information to surface through implication rather than explanation. Rhythm and diction are controlled; the prose modulates from denser description to simpler lines (“I’ve got the moss”) at emotional peaks for effect. It’s highly polished and coherent, though the elevated lyricism occasionally smooths away some rawness that might further individuate the voice under maximum stress.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct rhythmic texture (short declaratives intercut with longer, sinuous sentences) that matches the river imagery and emotional state. Patterned diction around currents, flow, and dissolution is consistent without feeling mechanical, and the rare direct dialogue (“You’ve been collecting us,” “I’m listening”) lands with weight. Psychic distance stays steady and appropriate; we never slip into unexplained omniscience except in the deliberate epilogue frame.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature focused on texture, cold, and fragile objects. Syntax and rhythm vary well, balancing long, image-rich sentences with short, declarative pivots (“Tonight, she would try again.” “The world could keep its endings.”). The register fits the quasi-mythic, solitary practitioner and never slips into jarring modern abstraction or explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by the locksmith’s craft and temperament; his way of noticing (gears as language, echoes as harvest, reflections as whispers) feels particular. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with long, sinuous sentences for reflection and clipped ones at pressure points (“His fingers trembled. The timer ticked once, softly…”). There is no head-hopping or stance drift; even the higher-register metaphors stay plausibly within an introspective, slightly poetic thinker. The modulation at the climax and ending is controlled, sharpening rather than blurring the emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and texturally rich, with distinctive coinages like “shingled hush” and “whalebone harp/reverie” establishing a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well-controlled; we stay close enough to feel Elira’s embodied experience while maintaining a mythic narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a distinct way of perceiving (e.g., collecting overheard stories as shells). Dialogue is sparse but effective; the 25-year-old ghost’s brusquer idiom and lines like “You’re holding it wrong” distinguish her from the narration and advance pressure. Rhythm modulates well between longer, image-heavy sentences and tighter, cutting lines at turns (“The lagoon didn’t ripple. It remembered.”). There’s slight risk of uniform elevated diction, but it remains believable as Lira’s interior register.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is assured and consistent, with a distinct texture that blends technical attentiveness (“drainage schematics,” “paths of least resistance”) and lyric metaphor (“as if hope itself had been a fleeting attraction”).

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Liora’s, with strong control over rhythm and image choice (“its hull groaning with the weight of forgotten things”; “the ink had bled like old wounds”). The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge jumps, and the lyric compression is taught from the opening line and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture in images like “kelp-drift peace” and “rough and crackling like dry kindling” that are clearly Liora-colored rather than generic.

Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-revealing, especially in the scar conversation. The lyricism stays legible even under stress, modulating rather than flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)

Lyric density is high but generally controlled, with syntax and rhythm modulating well around key beats (the pendulum’s pause, the chime). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; reflective passages stay clearly tied to present stimuli. A few lines come close to over-poeticizing, but they don’t break the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Elias’s sensibility: grounded in soil, roots, and quiet attention, yet capable of registering the uncanny. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—longer, lush sentences for atmosphere, crisper ones for turns like “Elias’s throat tightened. He knew that scent.” The elevated diction aligns with the velveteen-gothic tone and never breaks POV plausibility in this fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is confident, with strong rhythmic control and evocative diction (“a vibration like a held breath,” “the shape of the silence”). POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the perceptual signature—conceptual, metaphor-heavy, quietly awed—feels consistent with Liora’s vocation.

Still, the voice is distinctive and controlled enough to be publication-ready with minor trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident and distinctive, with a lyric, slightly haunted register that stays consistent while modulating intensity around key beats. Diction like “shortwave radio’s dial, its glow secretly luminous” and “the story famine had lasted seventeen years” feels apt for this world and character, not like generic purple prose. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Lira’s lines sound appropriately simple and direct against Elias’s more reflective narration, giving a clear status and age contrast. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the narrative stance maintains a coherent, character-filtered perspective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters everything through Liora’s aesthetic and philosophical obsessions. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony while sustaining a somber, incantatory feel. There is no POV leakage; even the few quoted lines of dialogue feel organic to the established register. The piece demonstrates confident handling of close third in a lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—acerbic, tactile, steeped in rust and salvage—and remains consistent even in expository or reflective passages. Dialogue is compact, character-specific, and functional: Veyra’s crisp, pragmatic speech contrasts with Elias’s more ruminative barbs. The narrative lexicon (“a rat who’d read too many books”) matches Elias’s education and bitterness without sliding into anachronistic register. Under pressure, the voice tightens rather than fraying, especially in the rising-water sequence and the dry-ironic cut to the clerk.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a musician and teacher, with a strong perceptual signature in how he notices sound and silence. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentence music that fits the contemplative mood without drifting into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual (“We don’t have to be loud … Just… present”), and it advances the emotional stakes. Psychic distance stays coherent, with no head-hopping or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture that suits a chef who experiences memories as flavors. Psychic distance is steady, and the diction generally matches Elias’s sensibility, integrating culinary and tactile imagery. The isolated technical phrase “synaptic plasticity” is a mild register jolt but still plausible in a slightly speculative milieu. Rhythm and sentence variety support the contemplative yet charged tone very well.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“raw as honey from a crushed comb,” “their lights flickering like fireflies”). Psychic distance is well controlled: we move smoothly between close interior and atmospheric observation without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but age-appropriate and effective, and his truthful answer to the girl is tonally and rhythmically right. The prose feels like one clear sensibility rather than generic template.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in its focus on minute sensory shifts and forgotten objects. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the rare on-page line of dialogue (“You’re close now.”) is spare and well-placed. The narrative stance knows more than Liora but remains plausibly anchored in her consciousness. It’s strong, though an even finer modulation between lyricism and plainness at peak beats could make it feel less uniformly burnished.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice closely aligned with Liora has a distinct, lyrical texture—dense metaphor, pressure-as-speech, and an old, patient intelligence that feels coherent throughout. Dialogue and telepathy are economical and charged with subtext; the contrast between signed speech and mental projection reinforces status dynamics and otherness. Psychic distance and register are well controlled, with elevated language suiting the mythic, undersea setting. The patterned metaphors around pressure, cracks, and structural weakness teach themselves early and pay off without confusing focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct blend of austere lyricism and mathematical abstraction that fits Lena’s mind. Phrasing like “time here was a rumor” and “the staircase was a proof in motion” gives the narration a recognizable texture without excess ornament. Psychic distance stays controlled, never leaking into authorial explanation beyond what Lena would reasonably think. The occasional aphoristic sentence still feels character-credible, though one or two verge on essayistic neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the painter’s sensibility, with recurring sensory focuses (ink, scent, light) giving a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax varies with emotional temperature—long, sinuous sentences in reflective beats; tighter lines around the leaf’s movement and his surrender to sleep—without lapsing into showy opacity. There is no head-hopping, and the modest omniscient reaches (re: city’s sleepless souls) feel consistent with the established narrative distance. Overall, the voice feels confident, controlled, and publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident, with consistent sensory bias (water, stone, bread, honey) and a cadence that modulates well between quiet observation and charged revelation. Diction and imagery feel organic to Liora’s role as museum guide and inheritor of oral tradition, avoiding register clashes or explanatory intrusions. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying character and theme (“Now we make letters like tombstones”; the boy’s spiderweb-thin voice) without feeling expository. There’s a clear, distinctive perceptual signature; the only restraint on an even higher score is that the lyricism occasionally smooths over chances to sharpen Liora’s idiosyncratic thought patterns under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, tonally consistent, and marked by a distinctive metaphorical palette (“splinter in the throat of the sea,” “bruised violet of a storm’s underbelly”). Diction fits a slightly heightened, mythic register that matches the concept and Elias’s obsessive cast of mind. The narrative stance stays cleanly inside his perceptual bias without head-hopping, and the rhythmic control—alternating compressed beats (“One pull.”) with lush description—serves pressure rather than blurring it. At times the lyricism risks over-saturation, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads intentional rather than drifty.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-close voice is confidently baroque yet controlled, with a consistent gothic-surreal texture that feels native to Lysander’s perception. Dialogue is sparse but sharp and goal-driven (“Then why are you armed with a whisper?”) and the advisor’s and double’s lines carry distinct tonal signatures relative to the narration. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with lyric density easing at action peaks so clarity is never lost. A few quippy flourishes (“he’d just made the sheets”) flirt with cleverness for its own sake but don’t materially fracture the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent musical and tidal lexicon (“unplayed sheet music,” “sound bloomed like a bruise,” “rolling thunder of euphony”). Third-person limited sticks close to Leeward’s sensibility, and the prose rhythm modulates well between description and event. The diction feels plausible for a mythic, quasi-mystic prophet, maintaining coherence without slipping into abstract essaying. Some metaphors cluster densely, but they remain legible and pattern-consistent rather than feeling like authorial grab-bag.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward patterns, cracks, and cartographic thinking that feels specific to Elyas. Syntax and rhythm are well modulated, moving from measured lyricism to sharper beats at key turns (“The air thickened.” “Elyas didn’t flinch.”). The narrative avoids head-hopping and keeps knowledge plausibly bounded to Elyas’s inferences and expertise. A few abstractions (“patterns of pressure and time,” “languages of cracks”) lean more toward authorial than character lexicon, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice around Elias is controlled, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits an academic under strain. Descriptive rhythm is varied, and the prose modulates effectively between atmospheric description and tense dialogue. Dialogue itself is clean, purposeful, and carries status and subtext; Callahan’s smooth, morally certain tone contrasts credibly with Elias’s spare directness. There are occasional high-register formulations, but they fit the chosen narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction that suits an observant, slightly romantic surveyor. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the narrative never slips out of Elias’s focalization into unjustified omniscience. Phrases like “stoically sensitive” momentarily feel more like an external label than interior texture, but they don’t derail the voice. Overall, the prose stance is confident and stable, supporting the quiet intensity of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a meticulous archivist, with controlled, measured sentences mirroring Elias’s temperament. Diction is consistently elevated but not gratuitous, and recurring constructions (“He…” followed by deliberate verbs) feel intentional rather than mechanical. The narrative never slips out of his perceptual frame or indulges in unearned omniscience; even the big reveal remains grounded in what he reads and infers. Occasional lines flirt with abstract generalization, but overall the voice has a clear, character-shaped texture suitable for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with controlled rhythm and recurring syntactic patterns that feel intentional rather than generic. Diction (“descend while ascending,” “residue of a thousand half-remembered dreams”) matches the world’s surreal register and her artisanal, grief-attuned perspective. Psychic distance stays consistent; we’re inside her perceptions without gratuitous exposition. At times the uniform lushness risks flattening dynamic range—sharper shifts in texture at peak stress could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—scientific yet metaphorically sharp (“perturbation theory…was a knife”)—and remains stable under pressure. Lexicon and rhythm feel plausible for a scientifically literate protagonist and help fuse physics language with emotional stakes. Occasional thesis-like statements brush the edge of authorial intrusion, but they still sound like Lena’s mind working. POV discipline is tight, with no leakage into others’ interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lena’s sensibility—sharp, slightly wounded, and attuned to distortions and absence. Syntax and rhythm vary well, balancing long, image-rich sentences with shorter, weighted lines (“Lena didn’t answer.” / “Lena exhaled.”). Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the pilgrim’s weak protest nicely undercutting his own claim. The lyricism remains legible and character-grounded, never drifting into an abstract omniscient register.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm (“its tiles slick with the last gasp of ocean mist,” “the siege of hush”) that feels particular to this character and world. Psychic distance is handled well: we move fluidly between external detail and interior reflection without head-hopping or jarring stance shifts. The elevated diction fits the reflective, melancholic mode and never drifts into out-of-character academicism. Compression and elision are purposeful, allowing backstory and concept to surface through image rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person narration has a confident, lyrical texture consistent with a reflective, “uncommonly thoughtful” negotiator. Diction such as “furrowed hush” and “untethered stalemates” feels deliberate and character-coherent rather than authorially showy. Dialogue is spare, reads naturally, and carries subtext—especially in Kaelis’s hesitation and Elias’s gentle refusal to promise forgiveness. Psychic distance is well managed, staying near Elias while allowing occasional, controlled thematic widenings without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (counting poles, translating everything through navigation metaphors). Rhythms modulate nicely between long, lyrical sentences and shorter, declarative ones at decision points (“He wouldn’t paddle out today.” “No,” he said. “Just late.”). The brief dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing character without exposition. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the slightly elevated diction fits a man who lives in charts and constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third POV is steady and coherent, with a distinct perceptual texture—hard-edged yet capable of wonder—and clean control of access to Liam’s interiority. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between dense description (lake sequence) and clipped, grounded beats (coffee stand, chess game). Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext without exposition, especially in the park exchange. A few maxim-like lines from Morrow and the lake slightly flatten the otherwise character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“petals unfurling like secrets whispered between stars,” “soil that hummed with the heartbeat of things older than memory”) that feels like Liora’s perception rather than generic purple prose. POV is consistently close third, with no leaks into others’ interiority beyond what the magic makes plausible. The rhythm shifts appropriately between languid description and sharper, compressed beats at moments of conjuring. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the brother’s echoed “Liora, you shouldn’t have,” which carries subtext and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture (“moonlight bled,” “the slow unraveling of regret”) that clearly belongs to Liora’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping inward at key beats without head-hopping or authorial intrusions. Dialogue is sparse but natural and underwritten enough to carry subtext, especially the brother’s unmoving mouth and disembodied speech. The patterned diction around “unfastening,” “accumulating,” and “waiting” is deliberate and paid off at the end, showing strong rhythmic and conceptual control.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lien’s perception—abstract ideas (“shadow work,” “lack”) are always anchored in concrete objects like the photograph or the needle. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with patterned repetitions (“She believed in stitches”; “She began to stitch”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. The few lines of dialogue (the AI, the child) are spare and effective, adding tonal contrast without breaking the established narrative texture. There is no head-hopping or unjustified register drift, and psychic distance remains stable even at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lyric-register that feels suited to Elira’s sensibility and never drifts into academic or explanatory tones. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively, with longer, flowing sentences for cosmic or descriptive beats and tighter ones at turns (“A detour, then.” “A prophecy, then.”). Free-indirect shading (“because of course she would fulfill it by accident”) gives her a recognizable, wry inner texture without head-hopping. The lushness is controlled enough not to collapse under its own weight, though one or two moments flirt with over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice is consistent, with a confident, slightly lyric cadence that fits a meticulous, reflective protagonist (“his fingers tracing their secrets like a poet memorizing verses”). The narration maintains a stable distance and doesn’t leak knowledge Kael couldn’t plausibly have in the moment. Diction (“cradle of sparks,” “gearwork pulse”) coheres tonally without drifting into academic or incongruous registers. Occasional elevated phrasing risks feeling a bit writerly, but overall the perceptual signature is clear and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person lyrical voice is distinctive and consistent, with strong rhythmic control (“slick as a breath held too long,” “fine as regret”) that suits the mythic, melancholic register. POV discipline is solid—no head-hopping, and what’s known tracks to Liora’s perceptions, with cosmic hints arriving through sensory shifts and the disembodied voice. Diction stays coherent without obvious register slips, and patterned phrasing supports rather than obscures pressure. A few lines approach slogan-like abstraction, but they don’t materially disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctly Elias’s—a lyric, image-driven observer whose metaphors fit his history with photography and censorship. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure (e.g., timer chimes and storm beats shorten and sharpen the prose). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the reflective stretches stay anchored in present stimuli. At times the register risks preciousness, but it remains coherent with the chosen aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward physical mechanics and abstract angles—very apt for a philosopher-engineer. Dialogue sounds like two highly educated, competitive people fencing verbally; their rhythms and idioms are distinct yet compatible. POV remains effectively anchored in Elias while allowing a lightly omniscient texture (e.g., attributing eagerness to Liora) without jarring head-hops. Diction is elevated but feels native to the characters’ world, not like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice filtering everything through Elias’s sensibility is consistent and textured, with strong control of rhythm and a clear perceptual signature. Lyrical diction (“moon clawed free,” “silver wound,” “rusted heart beating”) feels mostly organic to the piece’s aesthetic rather than imposed. Dialogue is spare but effective, carrying subtext—Maren’s simple “You’re leaving” hits harder than any speech. A few aphoristic lines (“Some of us bloom in the dark”) flirt with crafted epigram more than in-character utterance, but they don’t break the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent sensibility that links music, weather, and machinery into a single perceptual texture. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate but not overwrought, and the brief dialogue at the end is spare, subtextual, and tonally aligned with the narration. POV remains stable and modest—no unjustified knowledge or head-hopping—and the narrator’s certainty maps well to what Lena could plausibly infer. The one potential limitation is that the lyric register is fairly uniform across beats, with little modulation into rawer textures under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that fits Liora’s role and the story’s mythic register, with controlled rhythm and recurring syntactic patterns that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction like “empirical whimsy” and “a taste like the first question ever asked” is elevated but coherent with the piece’s tone and perspective. POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the occasional zoom-out to describe the island itself still feels anchored in a consistent narrative stance. Under peak stress, the voice maintains clarity without collapsing into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that marries maritime imagery to emotional states (“the horizon was no longer a wound”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, image-rich lines and sharper, declarative pivots, especially around the compass’s activation and the closing actions. There is no POV leakage or register drift; the diction feels plausibly tied to a reflective, sea-anchored craftsman. It falls just short of the very top band because the voice, while beautiful, doesn’t take many surprising rhythmic risks under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reflective tone that suits the artist protagonist. The control of rhythm is strong, though the reliance on high-register metaphor in nearly every paragraph risks flattening the emotional peaks into a monotone of elevated prose.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical and elevated tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The control of psychic distance is steady, though the intensity is unrelenting, leaving little room for dynamic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    The fable-like omniscient voice is consistent but creates excessive psychic distance, preventing emotional intimacy with the protagonist. The head-hop into the officer’s mind ("Not when the hungry are your own soldiers’ families") is a clumsy expository shortcut used to justify the plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-lyric register, fitting the atmospheric intent. However, the high psychic distance ("Elias knew," "Elias understood") often summarizes the character's internal state rather than dramatizing his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and lyrical, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. However, the required element "retrocognitively" creates a jarring register clash, introducing a sci-fi/academic flavor that disrupts the established organic and mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into "writerly" abstractions and melodramatic phrasing ("grace so staggering," "earth stretched like a held breath"). This tendency distances the reader from the immediate physical action and reduces emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the magical realism genre. It maintains a distinct "battered marvel" texture, though it occasionally dips into melodrama ("banner for the drowned").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)

    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the reflective nature of the protagonist. The POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions, filtering the mechanical details through her artisan’s lens. The technique of narrating tasks aloud is a clever voice device that justifies exposition without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the noir-fantasy genre. It occasionally leans into standard phrasing ("The title mocked her"), but the stunt-driver interiority adds a distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistently elevated, fitting the mythic tone. However, the reliance on specific syntactic constructions ("the way [X]...") creates a rhythmic monotony that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a tone of reverence appropriate for the subject matter. However, it leans toward the melodramatic ("delicate curves of frozen music," "vibrate the air itself into stillness"), resulting in a layer of "purple" description that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly interpretive, functioning as a "helpful narrator" who explains every emotion and symbol to the reader. The tone effectively captures the requested "resonant hush" but lacks the psychic distance required to let the drama breathe on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the reliance on overt similes ("like stolen luck," "like old apologies") occasionally creates a distancing effect, and the dialogue leans toward expository declarations rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, balancing technical jargon with lyrical observation. The shift to a more poetic register during the nexus activation fits the protagonist's perception of time.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and perfectly suited to the gothic, atmospheric content. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader close to Elias's sensory experience without head-hopping. The tone holds the tension well throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately feverish, aligning well with Liora’s altered state. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to her perception while maintaining the story's mythic tone, though the register occasionally risks becoming too dense.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is consistent, gritty, and attuned to the setting's decay ("exhaled damp," "ribs of rusted track"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Elias's physical and emotional experience. The transition from the noise of the radio to the silence of the aftermath is handled with strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and professional, maintaining a steady third-person limited perspective. However, occasional filter verbs ("he noticed," "he heard") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The elegiac voice is consistent and controls the pacing well. There is minor reliance on filter verbs ("He felt," "He knew") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and genre-appropriate, but the control slips during the climax's tense shift (future-in-past to simple past). The narrative distance works well for the secretive character, though it occasionally lapses into explaining his methods rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, suiting the surreal, high-concept tone. The POV shift to the novice is structurally legible, though the high narrative distance keeps the reader emotionally removed from both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and lyrical, matching the protagonist's sensibilities without slipping into purple prose. The perceptual signature is distinct—hearing the cats by pitch, seeing the shell as a floorplan—reinforcing the character's unique worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated tone that suits the subject matter. There is a slight register clash when technical terms ("procedural generation") intrude on the otherwise atmospheric, almost fantasy-like diction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, handling the signing dialogue smoothly. The tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("ghost of rhythms not yet born"), but the mood remains cohesive and appropriate for the fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a polished, atmospheric tone that suits the steampunk/fantasy elements. The shift in focus from the storm to the "breath" of the zone is handled with precise control over psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and melancholic, fitting the gothic tone. The sensory focus (scent and light) is well-controlled. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing ("scents were thieves") that draws attention to itself, but it generally serves the story.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable mode ("sieve of starlight"). It occasionally drifts into purple descriptions ("shimmering things that moved like oil on water") but maintains a stable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlling the poetic tone well without slipping into purple prose. The POV remains tightly anchored in Liora’s perception, and the shift from solitude to shared experience is handled with appropriate distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, effectively blending technical precision ("calibrated," "distilled") with lyrical observation to suit the protagonist's profession. The POV remains tightly anchored in Liora’s perception, filtering the client’s emotions strictly through her sensory apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive, if slightly melodramatic, tone suitable for a fable. However, the dialogue ("You’re the one who leaves oranges") feels expository and stagey, serving to accelerate the plot rather than reveal distinct character voices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly mythic tone appropriate for the genre. However, the POV distance feels somewhat remote, prioritizing poetic observation over visceral immediacy. There is no head-hopping, but the interiority often summarizes emotion rather than embodying it in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and confident, perfectly suited to the fabulist tone. The control of narrative distance remains stable, enhancing the dream-like quality of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the protagonist's realizations. The distance slips into abstract labeling ("fortress of unspoken truths") rather than staying grounded in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the atmospheric content. It occasionally veers into overwrought territory ("symphony no human ear was meant to hear"), but the control of tone remains solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "mythic" tone that suits the immortal protagonist. While effective, it occasionally drifts into self-important solemnity ("stars learned to die") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident but suffers from an "explanatory" distance, frequently interpreting the meaning of actions for the reader ("She wasn't just fighting... she was navigating"). This creates a filter that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately paced. It occasionally slips into melodrama ("swollen with unspoken promises," "universe clearing its throat"), but the narrative distance is generally well-controlled and intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lyrical, melancholic voice is consistent and well-calibrated to the magical realism tone. The narrative distance is controlled, though the shift to a more fable-like distance at the end jars slightly against the immersive opening.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative perspective wavers, shifting from Liora’s intimate interiority ("to Liora it was excavation") to the Keeper’s detached observations ("She knew the rules") within the same scene. This head-hopping dilutes the emotional intensity of Liora’s sacrifice, pulling the reader out of her immediate struggle to offer external context.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, the prose occasionally drifts into self-congratulatory or purple phrasing (e.g., "poetic weaver of broken precedents") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism genre. However, the relentless poeticism creates a psychic distance that occasionally feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and tightly anchored to Lena's translator persona. It effectively blurs the line between memory and the present, though it maintains a high register that rarely relaxes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent within Liora's perspective until the final paragraphs, where the sudden shift to second-person address ("if you listened closely") jarringly breaks the psychic distance. This pivots the story from an immersive experience to a fable-like instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. It maintains a conspiratorial tone that suits the subject matter, though it occasionally dips into breathless adjectival phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident, utilizing a lyrical register that fits the fable-like quality of the story. There is a strong "engineering" filter to the interiority ("read the ghosts of pressure"), though at times the tone veers into melodrama ("gears so intricate they could weep").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)

The control over psychic distance is otherwise steady.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and sentimentalism. The narrative distance remains stable, but the tone sometimes prioritizes sounding "literary" over precision, as seen in the awkward phrasing of the laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like mode, managing the magical elements with confidence. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "tide’s regret," which distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but slips into melodrama ("violin screamed," "paint it with fire"), undermining the story's "calculated" tone. The reliance on single-sentence paragraphs creates a staccato, artificial rhythm that feels like a stylistic affectation rather than a voice-driven necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "purple" tendencies, maintaining a breathless, elevated register ("cosmic verse," "sky jealous") throughout. The lack of tonal variation or grounded, concrete observation makes the prose feel performative rather than intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent, blending the rough texture of Elias’s life with a lyrical tone. However, phrases like "slow dance of celestial bodies" feel slightly too elevated and authorial for the established "gravel" voice of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and suitably detached, fitting the character's persona. However, it occasionally relies on interpretive filtering ("A sentimental man would have wept") to define the character via negation rather than direct action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent in its mythic, elevated register, but suffers from melodrama ("between sigh and smile"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone often prioritizes sounding "poetic" over precision, leading to a distancing effect. The stylization fits the genre but feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into a poetic, elevated register that occasionally distances the reader. While the tone matches the "serene" protagonist, the relentless lyricism risks smoothing over the grit of the conflict, making the "oil-stained" world of the bar feel aesthetically curated rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and maintains an appropriate atmospheric tone. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("Lior knew," "She exhaled") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience, but the stylistic control remains solid.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and atmospheric. However, the distinctness of the POV is slightly dampened by a reliance on scaffolded comparisons ("as if," "like") which creates a filter between the character's perception and the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "weird fiction" tone. However, it occasionally slips into slightly heavy-handed profundity ("silent argument against linear time") that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly polished and distant, relying on elevated abstractions ("angles too sharp for grief") that distance the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the mythic tone. There is occasional filtering ("She understood now") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated register suited to the fable-like quality of the story. The "shadow keeper" persona is sustained without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent balance between gritty survivalism and lyrical wonder. The shift from cynical observation to the surreal climax is handled with control, ensuring the "glitch" elements feel like part of Lina's perceived reality rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a high-literary, slightly archaic tone that fits the "dynasty" subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently elevated and gothic, perfectly suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The tone manages to be oppressive yet beautiful ("wept condensation," "shivering bliss"). Narrative distance is controlled, keeping us close to the knight's perception while maintaining the mythic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent—melancholic and careful—fitting the protagonist.

The POV remains stable with Elias, filtering the world through his specific weary lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is tightly controlled on Lena for the first two sections but breaks into unauthorized omniscience in the "Years later" coda. This head-hop to a future historical perspective disrupts the established intimacy and narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, carrying a bruised, lyrical quality that fits the "ultraviolet" atmosphere well. The focus on sensory input—proprioception, vibration, light—creates a distinct perceptual signature for Liran. There is a slight tendency toward breathlessness in the pacing, but the control of tone across the transition from trauma to clarity is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is polished but overly reliant on "workshop lyrical" tropes, such as abstract-concrete pairings and constant synesthesia. The tone remains breathlessly poetic throughout, lacking the modulation of distance needed to make the emotional beats land.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic lyricism that fits the "petrichor collector" persona well. The psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Elias's perception, although the father's dialogue line feels slightly convenient as a way to voice the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a coherent lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the narration occasionally explains significance ("held memories," "hiding something deeper") rather than allowing the imagery to carry the weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the "searing reverie" requirement. There is a slight tendency toward melodramatic phrasing ("bleeding into the shape of screams"), but the control of psychic distance remains stable and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent "wild serenity" tone that balances the mythic with the mechanical. Interiority is filtered strictly through Liora’s specific knowledge base (roots, entropy, the ledger), avoiding authorial intrusion. The rhythmic control supports the building tension, particularly in the description of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its reverent, lyrical tone but frequently drifts into abstraction ("cradle of unseen growth"). The register remains elevated throughout, lacking the grit or variation that would ground the high-concept moments.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans into a self-conscious, "storyteller" cadence. The reliance on rhetorical parallelism ("Not because... but because," "Not to erase... but to weave") creates a rhythmic monotony at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally slips into explanatory summary ("The poet envied that boat") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the &quot;bronze quiet&quot; tone. Dialogue leans into cinematic one-liners (&quot;It’s a promise&quot;) which slightly undermines the naturalism but fits the genre mode.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent Gothic lyricism that fits the subject matter. While effective, the register occasionally drifts into slight overwriting with heavy adjectival phrasing ("bruised sky," "stubborn green fingers") that calls attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a tendency toward melodrama and "purple" phrasing ("trembling kiss," "bleeding into the air").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but drifts into melodrama ("time itself had decided to bend"). The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally summarizes emotion ("Lira felt the old pull") rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, elevated tone that suits the setting. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus on Liora's immediate physical struggle while conveying the broader metaphysical weight of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, melancholic, and controlled, perfectly matching the "fractured grace" tone requirement. The POV remains tightly anchored in Lior’s sensory experience, enhancing the paranoia, though the phrase "Pattern recognition was survival now" leans slightly into telling.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and suitably atmospheric, fitting the "magical keeper" archetype. However, it occasionally slips into purple prose ("breath of the sea," "vein of forgotten bone") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience. The perspective remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the fable genre. The perspective shift at the end ("the thing that had been a queen") is handled with confidence, though the distance prevents deep visceral intimacy during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a lyrical, "scientific romantic" tone throughout. However, the narrative distance is high, and the reliance on interpretative filters ("equation," "resolve," "potential") obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending the surreal with the grounded. The shift between the older Elias’s resignation and the omniscient narrative observations is smooth, though the tone occasionally teeters on the edge of melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct lyrical tone suitable for the genre. However, it suffers from a "writerly" quality where characters speak in polished aphorisms ("Maybe it’s the space between them") that lack naturalistic texture. The POV stays firmly with Elias, which is a strength.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but marred by a severe, repetitive rhetorical cadence ("not X, but Y") that dominates the narrative rhythm. The narrator frequently steps in to explain the symbolic significance of actions rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, successfully blending the magical and the mundane. The dialogue, however, occasionally drifts into poetic speeches that feel slightly unnatural for a tense, pre-dawn confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately atmospheric. The close third-person perspective filters the world effectively through Lila's analytical-yet-yearning worldview ("luck was just a lazy word for incomplete data"). The tone manages the transition from sterile medical anxiety to magical realism smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the atmospheric content. It occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("pitch of their regret") but maintains a stable point of view and distinct mood.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently melancholic, suiting the magical realism tone. Narrative distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama ("volcanic tenderness," "symphony of ash" vibes). The tone is breathless and mythic, which distances the reader from the gritty reality of the scene. The narration often asserts emotions ("regret," "tenderness") instead of evoking them through restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, slightly elevated tone, matching the surreal setting. However, the prose tends toward "purple" poeticism ("auroral sorrow," "unspools into the dark") that sometimes prioritizes sound over precise meaning, creating a layer of distance between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the noir-adjacent tone. However, it occasionally over-interprets for the reader (e.g., the parenthetical explanations of the walks), reducing the psychic distance and trust in the reader's inference.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    Point of view is unstable, shifting from the Guardian's external observation to the Boy's internal epiphany, and finally to the Father in the epilogue. This head-hopping dilutes the emotional impact and breaks the established narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, though it creates emotional distance that limits intimacy. The elevated tone supports the fable-like structure but sometimes drifts into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a cohesive tone throughout. However, it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("softly deliberate" used as a rhythmic crutch) and slightly overwrought phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, suiting the protagonist. There are no POV slips. The tone is well-controlled, though it occasionally dips into overt sentimentality ("fragile conviction," "weight of a clear conscience").

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, effectively conveying Lydia's internal state. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama, particularly in the reflective passages, which distances the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "whimsical artist" archetype. The narrative distance is well-controlled, though it occasionally dips into "purple" filtering ("whimsy was just the face of a man...") that creates a layer of authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is generally cohesive but suffers from register slips (the jargon "retrocognitively") and intrusive authorial guidance (parentheticals that explain the subtext). These artifacts distance the reader and break the immersive spell of the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and nostalgic tone appropriate for the ghost protagonist. The narrative distance is controlled, though the "winking fool" and "weeping king" details feel a bit calculated rather than organic to the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but prone to interpretative overreach, telling the reader exactly what the character "knew" and "felt" about deep cosmic truths.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The mythic, fable-like voice is consistent but creates a distance that limits emotional immediacy. The perspective remains firmly with Veyra until the end, where it zooms out to an omniscient "legend" view, breaking the intimacy of the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from "poetic" affectation. Phrases like "satellites orbiting a forgotten planet" feel like standard literary workshop tropes rather than a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realist tone. However, the register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("hummed with the hush," "ghosts of ink") that prioritizes sound over precision, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)

    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently atmospheric, perfectly suiting the mythic/gothic tone. The prose rhythm supports the building tension. A minor dip occurs with the antagonist's dialogue, which feels generic compared to the otherwise specific and evocative narration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a unified lyric tone appropriate for the protagonist's poetic worldview. However, the register occasionally drifts into melodramatic sentimentality ("tuning fork struck against the ribs of the universe") that feels more like the author performing poetics than the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is assured, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elegiac tone that fits the fable-like quality of the story. The distance is well-managed, keeping us close to the artist’s tactile perception while allowing for the broader atmospheric observations needed for the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, blending scientific terminology with emotional reflection in a way that feels specific to the character. There is a strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident, maintaining a fable-like tone appropriate for the content. The focus remains tightly on Liora, and the transition between the tower scene and the next day is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the introspective sci-fi genre. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("moon’s silver scalpel," "quaking reverie") which draws attention to the author rather than the character.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is generally professional and tense, fitting the investigator persona. However, the psychic distance slips during the "hazy precision" metaphor, which feels like an overwrought authorial insertion rather than the character's immediate perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic register, though it occasionally slips into abstract or melodramatic phrasing ("certify wonder as essential"). The lyrical style suits the genre, but the "blessed" label disrupts the immersion by introducing a modern diagnostic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tone is consistently solemn and mythic, fitting the genre. However, the narrative distance is frequently compromised by filter verbs ("Elias knew," "He felt"), and the dialogue ("What if you're wrong?") leans toward stock cinematic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The prose controls the distance well, moving from the detached observation of a craftsman to the intimate, chaotic interiority of the climax without breaking tone.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy register, though it occasionally slips into melodrama ("unraveled the aurora’s light into threads of gold").

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending lyrical observation with the character's "mystic" expertise. The prose filter matches Elias's perception ("liminal stretch," "vibration just beyond hearing"). The tone remains controlled, supporting the atmospheric build-up without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice generally maintains a lyrical, mythic quality, but suffers from jarring register shifts. The metaphor of "rummage sale boxes" clashes significantly with the ancient, timeless tone of the orchard, disrupting the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains an elevated, mythic tone, though it occasionally creates distance from the immediate physical action. The shift to omniscient summary in the final third weakens the intimacy established in the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like mode. However, the register occasionally drifts into performative "writerly" phrasing ("whispered apologies," "sorrow, quantified") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy lyricism but often tips into melodrama ("screamed as it unraveled"). The tone is cohesive, yet the relentless elevation creates a breathless quality that lacks dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the literary tone well. The POV remains stable, though the reliance on summarizing internal states ("guilt had ruined her") creates some distance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending mechanical terminology with organic longing effectively ("diaphragm hitched"). The shift to the "fears squirming" with recognition is a slip into slightly twee, unearned emotional projection, but the overall control of distance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly "writerly," leaning on a poetic register that prioritizes pretty phrasing over precision. The cadence becomes repetitive, particularly in the reliance on simile structures, which creates a rhythmic monotony that distances the reader from the urgency of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled. The "translation" of the world into symbols matches Lira's characterization perfectly, and the shift to "letting it be" at the end is a well-earned voice modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suiting the weird-fiction genre. It maintains a disciplined distance that heightens the loneliness, though it occasionally dips into standard genre phrasing ("shadow with a flame") rather than finding a uniquely sharp idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, fable-like tone appropriate for the genre. However, the narrative distance is somewhat static, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and evocative, fitting the mythic tone well. However, the narration occasionally breaks immersion to explicitly name prompt elements ("webs of intrigue... weren't just metaphor," "spiral of progressive disclosure"), which reads as meta-commentary rather than organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is confident and atmospheric, successfully blending the gritty (diesel, wreckage) with the ethereal. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly in Lena’s weary, perceptive headspace, though it occasionally dips into slightly purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the POV slides from Kael’s interiority to Liora’s mid-scene without a clear section break (a soft head-hop), which dilutes the focalization slightly despite the successful "relay" effect.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent noir-sci-fi tone ("bureaucrats with spreadsheets"). The shift in register during the realization ("not broken, but refracted") effectively mirrors the protagonist's expanding perception.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Narrative distance is well-controlled, and the prophetic, high-register voice is largely consistent. The tone supports the mythic scale of the events, though the "time like taffy" simile clashes slightly with the established gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suited to the "penny poet" persona, maintaining a stable POV throughout. However, the tone occasionally drifts into sentimentality, and the narrative distance is sometimes padded by filter verbs ("He watched," "He heard") that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the wintery, ethereal tone. It manages the shift from technical observation to metaphysical experience well, though the "ancient thing" tag at the end feels like a voice shift toward generic horror tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and lyrical ("unraveling of the world’s temper"), fitting the story's mythic tone well. The perceptual signature is distinct, though the solemnity occasionally risks flattening the emotional range.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)

The narrative distance is generally well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent but leans into heavy-handed poeticism ("gears whispering," "ink bled like a promise"). The tone matches the "inspirational" content but lacks the restraint or distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, merging technical terminology with lyrical abstraction ("transliterate gravity," "frequencies no ear had yet grown to hear"). The narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Pip’s perception while allowing for the broader irony of the ending. The tone balances the "groaning" weight of the setting with the protagonist’s manic optimism.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a staccato rhythm caused by excessive vertical spacing (many one-sentence paragraphs). This fragmentation feels like an artificial attempt to induce tension and results in a "screenplay" feel rather than a textured literary narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, atmospheric, and suited to the scholar protagonist, with a rhythmic control that matches the "hush" of the setting. The dialogue is functional, though the woman's lines ("We're mapping them") lean slightly into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, utilizing a high-lyric style that distances the reader from the grit of the scene. The POV remains stable with Lena, but the filter is so thick with interpretation that the immediate reality of the patient's death is softened.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "dramatic scrolling" syndrome—the excessive fragmentation flattens the rhythm. The tonal consistency breaks at the end with the transition to "kick in the door" bravado, which sounds more like an action movie trailer than the "quiet deliberation" established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, maintaining a "shrewdly innocent" tone that matches the protagonist. The prose texture supports the mythic quality of the story effectively.

    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the "searing reverie" tone. A slight POV breach occurs in the final moments ("somewhere in the village, a woman paused..."), shifting from Elias's limited perspective to an omniscient confirmation, which blurs the established distance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the magic realism elements. The close third-person perspective remains tight on Elias, effectively filtering the supernatural events through his specific worldview (gardener, organizer) without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from register slips when incorporating prompt terms ("predictive modeling was complete") that clash with the established high-fantasy tone. The narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally over-explains Liora's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the fable mode well. The shift to a slightly more distant, mythic register at the end is handled smoothly. There is a distinct rhythm to the prose that mimics the musical subject matter, though at times the "poetic" filter creates a slight distance from the gritty reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, matching the protagonist’s worldview. However, the tone occasionally slips into self-conscious art-speak ("face made of light and memory and the careful absence of answers") that feels slightly curated rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, gritty, and appropriately elevated for the tone. A few poeticisms ("gleaming like a held breath") feel slightly more authorial than character-bound, but the grim consistency of the perspective anchors the reader effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, suiting the "autumn" and "library" motifs. The rhythm is controlled, slowing appropriately during the singers' arrival to emphasize their fragility. There is a slight tendency toward poetic abstraction ("unlearned people") that distances the reader momentarily, but the narrative stance remains confident.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable mode well. However, the register slips occasionally—most notably with the scientific jargon "synaptic plasticity"—which disrupts the established magical realist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable. It maintains a steady, lyrical tone that suits the protagonist, though it occasionally dips into familiar sentimental rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately hushed, maintaining a cohesive mood throughout. However, reliance on filter verbs ("She had always noticed," "She understood") occasionally creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is lush and consistent, perfectly suiting Liora’s ancient, non-human perspective. However, the rhythm drags slightly during the intruder's beats due to repetitive sentence structures ("The human’s breath...", "The human’s knees...", "The human’s fingers..."). This syntactic repetition flattens the otherwise strong stylistic control.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice remains consistent, blending mathematical precision ("proof in motion," "closed system") with atmospheric tension. The shift from analytical observation to the breathless action of the leap is managed smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and controlled, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally leans into slightly precious descriptors ("ink the color of twilight") that soften the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, suited to the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("green ache of something returned"). The narrative distance is stable, but the reliance on summary prevents a deeper psychic connection to Liora during the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, maintaining a mythic distance appropriate for the fable-like tone. It manages the transition from mechanical detail to cosmic horror without breaking character or slipping into explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    The noir-gothic voice is consistent and immersive, maintaining a controlled narrative distance. The tone supports the surreal elements well, though it occasionally strays into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and closely filtered through Leeward's musician-prophet perspective. The terminology ("resonance," "sketch," "chorus") consistently reinforces his worldview. The sensory filtering is sharp, translating weather phenomena into musical potential effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately distant, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. The shift to interpreting the watchers' silence is handled well, maintaining the protagonist's specific perceptual filter throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("gilded frauds," "surrender flag"). The tone fits the genre but lacks the restraint and distinct perceptual signature required for the highest literary bands.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately lyrical, matching the protagonist's "poet" persona. The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Elias's perception. The shift to the library feels like a natural extension of the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent but creates distance through filtering and abstract summaries of motivation ("His motivation wasn’t curiosity; it was deeper"). The voice is functional and clear but lacks a distinct texture or rhythmic signature unique to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone appropriate for the subject matter. The distance is well-managed, staying close to the lantern maker's perceptions. However, the register leans slightly into "mythic" abstractions at times, which distances the reader from the immediate grit of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, blending scientific terminology with lyric grief ("equation bled," "violence of knowing"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Lena’s perception, enhancing the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    The POV is stable, but the narrative voice frequently intrudes to explain character interiority rather than trusting the dramatization. The tone leans into a "writerly" register that prioritizes poetic phrasing over character-specific perception, distancing the reader from Lena’s immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and moody, fitting the noir-fantasy genre. However, the narrative distance occasionally drifts into slightly melodramatic phrasing ("voice slithered," "gasp of ocean mist") that feels more performed than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly self-serious and elevated, often telling the reader how to feel about the scene ("silent reminder that... wisdom could be carved"). The tone creates a distance that prevents intimacy with the protagonist's actual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the nautical character. However, the daughter's letters read slightly melodramatic, and the narration occasionally over-poeticizes ("blue that swallowed apologies whole"), distancing the reader from the raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident and consistently filtered through Liam’s jaded but seeking perspective. The narrative distance is well-controlled, moving from physical sensation to memory without head-hopping. The tone balances the grittiness of his past with the surreal nature of his journey.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent mythic tone suitable for the genre. However, the reliance on somewhat familiar lyrical phrasing ("lost souls find lighthouses," "secrets whispered between stars") dampens the distinctiveness of the POV, making it feel occasionally more "writerly" than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. The narrative distance is managed well, keeping close to Liora's internal experience while describing the surreal elements of the glade. The prose rhythm supports the magical realism tone, though it occasionally leans heavily on adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing for both the cold observation of the bone ship and the intimacy of Lien's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the mythic content well. The narrative distance is appropriate for a fable, though the high-flown tone occasionally distances the reader from the character's immediate physical reality. The rhythm supports the "slow dance" motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of mythic competence that suits the "legendary sentinel" archetype. Transitions are smooth, and the focus remains tight on Kael's expertise, though the voice occasionally slips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("poet memorizing verses").

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic and somber tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. At times, however, the stylization creates distance, prioritizing poetic cadence over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the poetic persona of the protagonist. However, the tone often slips into melodrama ("mouth full of silenced verses," "X-rayed by grief"), which distances the reader from the raw reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the steampunk aesthetic. The point of view stays firmly anchored in Elias, filtering observations through his impatience and analytical mind.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and stable in POV, but the tone is overly self-conscious, prioritizing "poetic" phrasing over precise observation. The result is a layer of narrative distance that feels like a filter between the reader and the character's raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally overwrought, creating distance from the character's immediate struggle. The dialogue ("You're late," "So are you") feels staged and slightly cliché for the emotional weight of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a "high fantasy" register that allows for some overwrought phrasing. The integration of the required phrase "empirical whimsy" creates a jarring tonal clash with the established mythic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like quality of the story. The pacing matches Elias's characterization, though the perspective sometimes drifts into overly sentimental abstractions that distance the reader from the raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is neutron-star precise: “measuring the slow, inevitable collapse of massive things” compresses vocation and worldview in one stroke. Syntax mirrors content—long periodic sentences for orbital reflection, fragment bursts for dust settling. Perceptual signature is consistent: light fractures, spiral arms, veins in crust—every image filtered through an astrophysicist’s calibration. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; internal diction never leaks into committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric achieves a consistent, glass-fragile cadence; perceptual signature is artist-attuned to refraction, fracture, negative space. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Compression (“the canyon held its breath”) is taught early and paid off in final exhale. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: long clause clusters shorten to “One step. Then another.”

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-technical, matching a musician’s perceptual signature: “taut beneath the dust,” “warped and wet, like a voice rising from deep water.” Rhythm modulates from long frost-images to staccato bursts mirroring jagged notes. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“world smothered in quiet”) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is salt-eaten, slow, tidal—sentence lengths swell and ebb with the climb. Diction never exceeds Elias’s lexicon: “ribs of a shipwreck,” “kelp-choked throat.” Perceptual signature is relentlessly cataloguing—every object is weighed, dated, etched. No head-hop; compression in the climb is taught by gasped fragments that mimic oxygen debt. Rhythm control peaks in the stillness beat: three single-sentence paragraphs that force the reader to inhale with the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric-omniscient distance stays consistent, compressing time across months without head-hop; collective “they” and named individuals interlace cleanly. Diction—“calloused hands cradled,” “pebbles of anonymity”—carries ritual cadence that mirrors bell rhythm. No dialogue, so voice lives in weighted verbs: slipped, wrapped, rang, left. Final wind-personification pays off taught pattern of sound carrying agency.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined: compound clauses mirror twilight layering while tactile nouns (“brass lens,” “wet earth,” “iron left too long”) ground abstraction. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for memory swells, single-sentence exhalations for beats of recognition. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays in Elias’s sinew and sightline. Lyric diction never drifts into purple excess because each image earns causal place.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lyric-compressed diction—“sky the color of old silver,” “time wasn’t a line but a texture”—remains stable under third-person intimate, never drifting into explanatory prose.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays stapled to Lena’s perceptual filter: she traces, plucks, whispers, scatters—verbs of quiet control. Diction stays inside her lexicon—no academic register, only thief-argot (“oilcloth,” “fletching,” “duck-pond pit”). Rhythm compresses under pressure: three paratactic clauses when floor gives way. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Arrow’s corn-husk fletching and dyed flag blue are idiosyncratic sensory signature.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric first-person sustains a blacksmith-acoustical idiom: “violet hum of rust,” “frequency just below grief.” Compression taught early (“the sound bloomed behind his ribs”) and paid off in final listening.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices how light catches “unguarded breath,” reads flowers like clockwork, feels jar glow as slow heartbeat. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She hurled the jar. The collision wasn’t glass breaking—it was a sigh”—then elongates at leap. No head-hopping; stationmaster’s voice is external stimulus, not interior invasion. Diction stays within her sensorium: “gilded edge,” “wound of gold and violet.”

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is glass-artist’s perceptual signature: light catches, breath sculpts, dials frost. Rhythm modulates—long cooled sentences in calm, staccato mutterings under pressure (“First, you prime…”).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is muscular, stunt-performer precise: “pressure here, pivot there” echoes in her fingers tracing the cast. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as the guard approaches; longer, image-rich lines in the ladder beat. No filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is minimal but age-specific (“Told you”) and carries subtext. Free-indirect slips cleanly in/out without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: flaking gold as “gilded snow,” breath “curling into frigid air,” hush “amber and unbroken.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences mimic pooling quiet; final fragments mirror booklet scatter. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Eldrin. Experimental compression (“his voice…was not a sound but a shape”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close maintains consistent machine-distance: diction of “servos whirring,” “optical sensors,” “core temperature” never slips into human colloquialism. Perceptual signature—prismatic light, frequency-scanning curiosity—robot-specific, unborrowed. Rhythm mirrors data-stream pulses: short crystalline clauses build to longer looped sentences that mimic timeline folding. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat, no voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the “resonant hush” mandate; diction stays inside a night-shift registrar’s ken—“storage closet,” “box office”—never drifts into MFA loftiness. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences during eavesdrop, staccato fragments when she draws. No dialogue to distort; silence is the point. Perceptual signature is Lena-specific: she notices light-splitter edges and ticket paper the way a projectionist would.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate voice carries a horticultural cadence—short, rooted clauses that mimic pruning rhythms; perceptual signature is botanical (“leaves brushed her shoulders like old apologies”) and never drifts into academic or ledger diction, sustaining lyric compression without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is compressed, lyrical, technician-poetic: “mechanically warm,” “sideways dark,” “school of fish caught in a slow current.” Syntax flexes—fragments, em-dashes, rhythmic parallelism—taught in first paragraph and paid off in final breath-held hush. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets n/a. POV stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature selective (bolts, seams, magnetic hum). No filter-verb stacks; diction never drifts above his register.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is musician-centric: silence is a “held breath,” lanterns pool “unstruck chords,” water laps “like a slow, patient tongue.” Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—colon-separated clauses act as rests. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Register stays within a cellist’s lexicon: “downbeat,” “pitch,” “crescendo.” Compression taught early (“it wasn’t a sound—it was the absence of one”) and paid off in final sustained note.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“iron ribs groaning”) and paid off in the final wind-filled lungs. Syntax mirrors fever-clear exhaustion: clauses stack like pressure fronts, then fracture into single-line breaths at the exit. Perceptual signature is meteorologist-poetic: ravens, barometer, ozone read as omens. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Liora’s sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s sensory idiom: “picker-eye,” “ribs of rusted track,” valve “molared jaw,” diction mining diction yet precise. Rhythm swells from deliberate openers to staccato lunges during geyser, mirroring breath. No filter-verb glut; compression taught early (“static three nights prior”) pays off. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; psychic’s cliché safely external, shattered. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is sustained lyric-hypnotic, syntactic rhythm mimicking slow breathing: long cadences, repeated anaphora (“Somewhere…”), diction of sibilance and soft consonants. Perceptual signature—keeper notices decay, spines, creases, never sunlight—remains consistent. No head-hop; distance is steady slight-omniscient hovering inside the keeper’s skin. Experimental compression (“time did not pass so much as pool”) is taught early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric third-person stays tight to Elias’s musical perception—metronome shirt-twist, tuning-fork pocket, “pulse thrumming like a plucked bass string.” Syntax breathes with crescendo/Release pattern matching eclipse arc. No head-hop; Lila and Mira remain externally focalized, preserving distance. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual cost,” “ordinary magic”) nudges out of desert vernacular but frequency is low and pattern-taught early, so voice keeps its license.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Elias’s tactile antiquarian precision—“sensitively perceptive fingers,” “rusted-hinge exhale.” Rhythm clusters tighten under pressure: “He didn’t resist. The last historian had no need for balance.” No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction and cadence alone, which sustain a hushed, metallic lyricism without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mimics looping: short declaratives alternate with longer, breathless coils. Compression (“the color moved like liquid thought”) teaches the reader to accept figurative leaps early; payoff arrives when the same phrase is literalized as the priest is swallowed. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked on the priest until the coda widens to the novice, a clean hand-off.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Free-indirect lyricism stays tightly inside Li Wei’s perceptual filter: metaphors are acoustic, verbs are percussive (hummed, groaned, chuk-chuk-chuk). Rhythm modulates—short declarative beats under 3 a.m. fatigue, then elongated clauses as dawn swells. No head-hop; compression (“homesickness wasn’t a place but a when”) is taught early and paid off. Register spikes once—“conceptual Repricing” risk of overt thesis—is quickly re-grounded in shell-shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lyric-compressed voice owns a perceptual signature—gravity “hesitated around him,” rain clings “like a second skin,” time moves “sideways”—taught in the first paragraph and sustained to the last line. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentation at the merger beat (“collapse, a merging, the fractured timelines knitting…”) then exhales into longer cadences as weight arrives. No head-hopping; narrative certainty stays within Elias’s plausible knowledge. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s tactile perception; no auditory adjectives sneak in. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for cavern stillness, staccato fragments for needle snap and pocket weight. Signed dialogue is rendered as italicized translation, preserving subtext (“You’re not here for drums”). No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (ran, pressed, traced). Voice remains distinct under peak stress: “vibration that bypassed his ears and settled in his ribs.”

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Meteorologist’s perceptual signature—barometric quivers, ozone taste, lateral knot-work—governs syntax and diction; no head-hop, distance steady, rhythmic control exact, final sentence a blade-cut cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is olfactory-first (“aromatically cautious”), syntax shortens under scent-assault. No head-hop; UV grammar is taught early and paid off. Dialogue absent, so naturalism clause waived. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for self-taught craftsman; metaphors (petals like embers, veins like lightning) match observed phenomena rather than ornamental drift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric first-person maintains perceptual signature: “breath hitched when he thought too hard about the future.” Syntax stretches and compresses with pendulum beats; fragmental elision is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within drifting poet’s lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s sensorium: “humidity clinging to her skin,” “strings humming faintly.” Syntax lengthens during violin phrases, fractures during rustle-alert. No dialogue until the sparse exchange—“You’re real.” / “So are you.”—which carries subtext of mutual rescue. No head-hops; perceptual signature is violinstic—she hears silence as taut wire. Register never drifts; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s shrewd, sensory noticing; no head-hop. Syntax modulates—long cadence for crowd scan, clipped fragments at midnight reveal. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext; voices remain distinct (his wry vs. her guarded). No register drift or filter-verb clusters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays locked to Reed; perceptual signature—hollow-stem whisper, razor-sharp obsidian—remains reed-carver specific. Syntax ripples like carved grain: “how they bent but never broke” teaches cadence early and pays off in final palm-press. No dialogue until Syl’s two-line exchange; indirection carries weight. Minor filter verb cluster “she decided then to find Syl” could be tighter (−0.2), but voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate sustains illustrator’s perceptual signature: ink bled upward, canal as black glass, echo-leash silver-slick. Rhythm flexes with pressure: short clauses at cliff-edge (“Wait—”), then lyrical upward spiral. No head-hop; boy’s interior withheld, maintaining mystery. Diction stays within artist lexicon; phrase “stained glass wings” reappears with shifted weight, taught pattern paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyrically compressed yet pattern-taught early (“slow, silver pulse”) and paid off at closure (“quiet mathematics of the possible”). Perceptual signature is conjurer-mathematician: variables, coefficients, prisms, Morse code—grief filtered through equation-vision. Syntax modulates from long liquid cadences to fragmentary beats (“He listened until the note dissolved”). No dialogue to contaminate voice; unreliability is absent, so distance control is tight. Elision (“some things can’t be preserved”) is purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual signature: “hum of the city’s power grid was just loud enough to drown out his own breathing.” Syntax is methodical, mirroring his pipe-chase crawl; diction stays within a self-taught archivist’s lexicon. No head-hopping; the woman’s recognition is externally observed. Rhythm accelerates only when the tape spins—voice control is surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person free indirect stays tight to Liora’s plant-biased perceptual signature (“cells rearranged themselves… fluid, alive”). Rhythm accelerates into sentence fragments during storm peak, then relaxes into longer breaths at dawn. No dialogue, so naturalism tests waived. Diction never exceeds botanist lexicon; “lattice of green and gold” is earned through prior trellis stitching.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is painterly—“glinted like a trapped sunbeam,” “rain fell in crooked trails.” Diction remains within his lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Compression taught early (“the island’s slow hunger for anything beautiful”) pays off in closing cadence. Syntax mirrors fatigue: parataxis in early sentences, then tighter clauses post-vision. Voice never lapses into editorial explanation; unreliability is hinted but not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person hovers at psychic distance 2–3, filtering every descriptor through Liora’s sensorium: “sound like music,” “weight of silence.” Syntax swells and contracts with cave breath; no head-hops. Dialogue single line carries subtext: entity speaks her own blindness back at her. Voice remains consistent, never ventriloquing beyond her lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s salt-cracked perceptual signature: “the air smelled of ink and damp parchment.” Syntax mirrors archivist precision—colon-heavy catalogues, em-dash interruptions—yet breathes during lighthouse ascent. No dialogue, so voice carries through rhythmic variation and sensory filtration. Toss line “Blow when you’re ready” modulates to child-directed clarity without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“quivering,” “bit,” “trembling certainty”—mirrors Elias’s analytical lyricism. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent even at platform vision, reading as projection of his rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Liora’s perceptual filter: whales “vibrate through the tower’s bones,” ink “bleeds into the shape of his hands.” Syntax mirrors her scientist precision yet yields to tidal rhythm—long sentences swell, fragment at vision. No filter-verb clutter; “she didn’t look away” is direct action. Register consistent; diction stays within stargazer lexicon. Voice modulates under pressure without external exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is singular, lyric-philosophic, compressed: “geometry gone feral,” “sky that was also a sea that was also the space between breaths.” Syntax warps with spatial mutiny—fragments, em-dashes, elliptical clauses—yet stays legible. Perceptual signature is immortal-specific: stars learning to die, marrow of infinite years. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; rhythmic control heightens pressure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings to Lira’s con-artist perceptual signature: every object is a tool or balance sheet. Rhythm tightens under pressure—fragmented syntax as ink surges. No head-hopping; girl’s voice stays exterior, maintaining distance. “Numbers didn’t add up to her” is a sharp final modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited maintains a hushed, lapidary cadence that matches “incandescent restraint”; diction (“refracting the past through the present”) stays within the stationer’s artisanal lexicon. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—he “records textures” rather than feelings—until the final birdsong, where syntax loosens to mirror release.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is saturated with port patois—groan of cranes, scent of diesel, language of rust—yet filtered through a ghost’s detached ear. Rhythm swells and contracts with tide and breath; short clauses mimic flickering silhouettes. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays locked to Daniel’s synesthetic dead-man sensorium. Experimental compression (“the labyrinth didn’t rest; neither did the dead”) is taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is poet-skeptic: scientific diction (“resonant hum, retelling”) collides with salt-skin physicality. Rhythm mimics cello—long bow sentences then staccato fragments under pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent (hears paint flake, smells telescope oil). Compression taught early (“whisper of closing pages”) and paid off. Minor tic: two “then he” openings near midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elira; perceptual signature is metallic, gear-driven (“brass cuff whirring”, “paint hissed”). Syntax lengthens under pressure—periodic spray-can actions interrupt longer reflective clauses—mirroring pulse of graffiti strokes. Jax’s single voiced line carries working-class cadence; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person hovers at breathing-distance, adopting Elias’s perceptual syntax: lens-metaphors, countdown diction, oxygen-mask breathiness. Rhythm accelerates with clause fragments under pressure—“Then another. And another.”—then lengthens into elegiac cadence for the final lift-off. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; “the camera’s viewfinder framed” keeps agency with tool, not narrator. Lexicon stays inside professional register—bioluminescent, regolith, canister—without show-off density.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual toolkit—sound, temperature, vibration—creating a distinct syntactic signature: “the way stress fractured through materials like whispers through a crowded room.” No head-hopping; drone stays object, not POV. Compression purposeful: “He didn’t need eyes…” teaches elision early and pays off. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for mist, staccato for *Lumen*’s data pulses. Dialogue minimal and brass-voiced captain cuts through, maintaining separation. No filter-verb stacks; prose breathes with immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient with perceptual signature: the town “breathes,” stones “remember,” time is measured in fork-hums—consistent metaphoric register. Syntax mirrors pulse: long clauses for sweep, fragments for struck notes. No head-hop; distance stable. Diction stays within poetic folk-tale register, never drifts into workshop gloss. Dialogue (two lines) carries indirection and regional weight. Under stress, prose compresses to drum-beat repetitions of “walk,” “strike,” “listen”—rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct lyric-cinematic texture: fracturing blue glow, slow jellyfish stars, “gathered hush.” Syntax modulates from clipped panic to languid surrender, mirroring pressure shifts. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through sensory indirection. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she swore she caught”) and stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is oceanic-gothic: rusted needle, throat of the sea, copperlight repose—yet every metaphor is filtered through Elias’s sensory hunger. Rhythm accelerates up the stairs, then breathes at the cracked glass, mirroring physical ascent and moral precipice. Compression like “chasing hush” teaches the pattern early and is paid off when hush arrives “real and absolute.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays salted, metallic, confessional.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct texture: frost-weep, silver-throated, winter-cracked—neither purple nor generic. Rhythm modulates: long vowel elegy vs. clipped “Again?” keeper line. Perceptual signature = alchemical botanic lens; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal, indirection strong: “Almost.” = compressed hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is salt-bit, rope-calloused, hymnal—distinctive diction stays inside a weaver’s lexicon. Rhythmic control: long cadences for sleepwalking, staccato fragments for plate-to-stone contact. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays consistently close to Elias. Syntax mirrors loom logic—“each step a stitch”—so prose becomes character. Filter verbs serve voice (“the canyon answered”) rather than diluting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—“roots pulsed faintly, as if breathing” is his projection, not exposition. Rhythm mirrors breath: long sentences for descent, staccato fragments for crack and laugh. No head-hop; Liora’s voice is reported, not interiorized. Near-hairline slip: “they say” is slightly generic, but it is anchored in Elias’s memory of village talk.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close stays consistently inside Lena’s perceptual orbit: neon ghosts as half-remembered dreams, chalk grit like static. Syntax is supple—parallel fragments, tactile nouns—mirroring her cataloguing mind. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts smoothly to the envelope *thunk*. Voice never explains its metaphors, trusting the reader to feel the analogue ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: Elias thinks in star-catalog syntax—constellations “long collapsed into silence,” light “bent into secrets”—a lexicon no other character could own. Rhythm modulates from long, breath-tuned sentences during embroidery to staccato warnings (“They’re coming”). No head-hopping; courier’s interiority is kept opaque, filtered through Elias’s needle-noticing gaze. Compression such as “stories stop everything” is earned by prior tapestry of concrete stitches, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is lush yet precise—“gnarled roots cradling the black water like a secret.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses build texture, then shorten at release. No head-hopping; diction stays within Liora’s mystic lexicon. Patterned elision (“the spirits always knew”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Voice is distinct enough to edge into 9-band territory, but a single overt lyric flourish (“fierce tenderness”) keeps it at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-close POV stays locked; perceptual signature precise—translator ear hears silence as “held breath,” medic eye sees spiral as throat-constriction. Rhythm modulates: long clause for memory mortar-stutter, fragment when coral bites. No head-hop; boy’s interior inferred only through Lena’s decrypting gaze. Diction stays within war-zone medic lexicon—“shrapnel nested,” “phantom rifles.” Compression in final line “embers cupped” taught by earlier fog-breath; payoff clean.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—edges “soft,” pigments that “hum,” fog “thick as grief.” No head-hopping; crowd’s wonder is filtered through Liora’s watching. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for memory, clipped fragments under pressure (“It was a daydream made solid”). Diction stays within artisan lexicon—“emulsion,” “loam,” “bottled light”—never drifts into academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter—sound, pigment, coin warmth—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for garden awe, clipped fragments during re-entry. No register drift; figurative language is disciplined. Dialogue sparse but voice-distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: POV filters description through insect-scale attention (“grooves only his fingers could read”). Rhythm modulates—long, humid clauses in greenhouse, staccato sowing beats under drone buzz. No head-hopping; single POV held. Free indirect slides cleanly: “his hands didn’t shake” marries exterior action to interior resolve. Dialogue sparse but each line carries subtext (“if they dig it up?” = will code survive?). Only hairline slip: “candidly cryptic” is self-diagnostic; context justifies voice but keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is sinuous, salt-rusted, hypnotic—syntax elongates then snaps like kelp: “She licked her lips, tasting salt and the metallic tang of verses not yet bled.” Perceptual signature is poet-as-instrument: wind is “ever her accomplice,” sound bends in calcium veins. Compression taught early (“shyly unstoppable, the way roots split stone”) and paid off in reef-shadow joy. No head-hopping; ghost voice is filtered through her palm. Rhythm modulates with tidal breath, never monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter; diction (“opal,” “foxglove regret,” “shattered rainbows”) is luxuriant yet consistent with a librarian who names sensations precisely. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—single-line paragraphs mimic held breath released. No dialogue, so voice texture is carried through syntax; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“half-remembered dream”) pays off in final quiet. Filter verbs rare and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person folds perceptual signature into syntax—long vowel-rich sentences mirror song, then fracture into shard-short clauses at climax. No dialogue, so voice must carry all; it does. Diction (“sylph-touched indigo”, “harmonic gaps”) remains within Elara’s scholar lexicon. Pattern of elided connectives (“She dipped… the nib trembling—”) is taught early and sustains. Filter verbs kept for rhythm not slack; rhythm control under pressure is exemplary, missing only the final squeak of a 9+ is the slight repetition of “promise” as noun/verb five times.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice owns engineer precision: “gears so intricate they could weep,” “yield-a harmony of flow.” Syntax lengthens under revelation, contracts under confrontation — rhythmic control deliberate. No head-hop; interior access stays locked to Liora. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; volcanic groan and brass chill feel perceptions, not author decorations.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: composer brain converts every sense into musical notation—coos are “notes from a broken record,” dust motes are “sheet music,” perfume is “bergamot and mothballs” scored for attar and decay. Syntax lengthens and syncopates during lyric memory, then tightens into single-line commands (“Find him. Bring him back.”) under pressure. No head-hopping; Madame Holloway’s status shift is read entirely through Elias’s auditory filter—her cane “taps up the stairs” like a metronome. Register never exceeds Elias’s 1923-almanac lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual lens: “cornstalks whispering in a fractured hush” mirrors his guilt. Syntax tightens under pressure—no filter-verb clusters; diction (“featherly,” “warped floorboard”) is character-specific. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. Compression (“Took you enough”) is taught and paid off. Voice modulation from cerebral architect to humbled father is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly fused to Lior’s perceptual filter: “lightly attentive gaze,” “violin screamed…raw and jagged,” syntax taut as bow-hair. Diction—“orchestrating serendipity,” “ledger waiting to be balanced”—suits a mind that thinks in musical algorithms. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses while he calculates, staccato fragments at torch-gasp climax. No head-hopping; crowd voices enter only as sonic data. Distinctive perceptual signature (pattern-hunting over body-survival) sustains voice under pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is irreducible: syntactic tide—long liquid clauses that break into staccato fragments under pressure (“She watched. / A heron…”). Diction stays within tide-dancer’s ken—no academic bleed. Perceptual signature absolute: nostalgia ban, tide rhythms, star-drawn light filter every noticing. Rhythm accelerates with breath-hold, then exhales into final smile—pattern taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person close stays welded to Elias’s perceptual signature: glass warms like skin, mist tastes tidal, ripples speak. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath—no template cadence. Diction is glazier-lexical: “noctilucent reckonings,” “fractured light,” never academic intrusion. Compression (“He wasn’t praying. He was communing.”) teaches the pattern that pays off in the final heartbeat flare.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual signature—scarred, fire-wise, alert to resin and ash. Syntax roughens or softens with emotional temperature; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“voice like gravel and a quiet that settled like ash”) is taught early and paid off in the final lighter footfalls. No head-hopping; the emoji is the single exterior concession, justified as the technological conduit to his daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyric-scientific, precise yet tidal: “equations in the curve of a shell” marries logic to shimmer. Syntax undulates—long tide-like sentences broken by single-word beats (“She laughed”). Perceptual signature is steady: Liora notices refraction, drift, pattern potential, never tourist detail. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; register stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with needle-spin, then exhales—matching the concept of hope as dynamic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close sustains a hush-filmic rhythm; perceptual signature favors auditory and tactile detail over visual gloss, fitting an echo-cartographer. Syntax grows clipped when he strikes the match—pressure without drumbeat. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulates but never breaks frame.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: rainbows bleed, heartbeats seep like mist, bells swallow light. Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic the mirror’s cloud-clear cycle. No head-hopping; every metaphor is motived by her craft—glass, light, song—creating a singular, irreplaceable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric, compressed third-person intimate stays inside Veyra’s perceptual filter. Diction—“operatively gentle,” “quiet violence of hope”—is POV-consistent negotiator jargon. Rhythm accelerates during pen hover, breathes with sentence fragments: “No. I want you to muster…” No head-hop; Kael’s interior read through gesture & speech. Filter verbs serve voice, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited sustains an engineer’s perceptual signature—measurements, maps, ledgers—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for abstract math, abrupt fragments under pressure (“The egg would not hatch.”). No dialogue, so voice must carry subtext; it does, through negative space and negation. Patterned repetition of “no” teaches the cadence early and pays off in the final “echo,” achieving Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—calligrapher’s precision in “letters seemed to breathe,” synaptic metaphor “stories only half-told.” Rhythm modulates: long cadences for reflection, staccato “He’d leave the strings loose” for decision. No head-hopping; unreliability absent; diction kept within artisan-intellectual lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is compressed, scientific, yet lyric—an esoteric realist’s perceptual signature: “catalogued the weight of wind.” Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as the spiral nears completion, mirroring held breath. No head-hopping, no filter verbs—each metaphor is anchored to Lior’s instruments (thread, bone, wing). The final sentence’s quiet volta (“the wind was always hungry for signals”) is earned by the diction established in line 1.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, filleting glacier, aurora, and artery in the same breath. Syntax glides from long meltwater clauses to urgent fragments—“The sanctum trembled.”—mirroring pressure. No head-hop, no filter-fatigue; perceptual signature is Elira’s wax-and-flame history. Minor over-troping in “snowmelt ardor” is earned by pattern, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays tightly interior to Lior; perceptual signature is selective and biased—“ozone, maybe, or the ghost of machine oil.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: short staccato beats during film stutter, longer lyrical lines during dissolution. No head-hopping. One tiny register drift: “conceptual repricing” is academic diction, but it occurs inside the terminal’s voice, justified.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Qishti’s perceptual filter: "slow, indifferent arcs," "frugal rhythm," "empirically ironic thrill" are diction choices no other character would make. Syntax lengthens and contracts with his attention—short clauses when ciphering, rolling cadence when descending passage. No head-hopping; palace and stars are externalized only through his professional gaze. Register remains scholarly-ancient without anachronism; "starless sky," "cosmos where stars were...living eyes" maintain consistent metaphoric universe.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Lior’s perceptual filter—“silence thick as wool” is sensory, not abstract. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for memory bursts, fragments under pressure (“Now what?”). No head-hopping; ghost-Kael’s interior is inferred only through Lior’s bodily response. Diction remains within Lior’s plausible diction—“jagged,” “unspooled”—and the final cadence mirrors the sustained note.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to the maker’s perceptual signature—frost “like shattered glass,” fog as skin—while syntax elongates then compresses to mirror inhalation/exhalation. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction remains artisan-concrete (“calloused fingers,” “warped brass”) even at peak transcendence. One hairline slip: the brother’s disembodied voice momentarily ventriloquizes theme, but the POV recovers before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close hovers at poetic distance, filtering every detail through the mender’s synesthetic perception—earth as pulse, forgiveness as scent. Syntax stretches into litany under pressure ("Not for treasure, not for bones...") then snaps to short declaratives at the bite, mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal—memory of daughter’s “endearingly feisty” syntax versus mender’s more formal grief. Compression is patterned and taught early; elision ("three years since...") is paid off in the sprout.</answer>

    <comment>Rhythm modulates from long, vine-like sentences to urgent fragments without algorithmic repetition. Metaphors are disciplined—"roots tangled through cracked marble like veins stitching wound to wound"—and stay within physical logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Opening and closing lines are propulsive, the final "They’d ask her about the stitches next time" leaving a charged echo.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veyra’s perceptual signature—cataloguer’s taxonomy, synaesthetic scent of violet sap, preference for bathroom acoustics—remains consistent and distinct. Controlled psychic distance and rhythmic fragments ("Danger was the point.") heighten pressure without head-hop; the experimental slippage (mirror speaks) is pattern-taught and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-close prose is controlled, rhythmic, and character-specific: “whispers between words the way others heard music” is an Elias-only ear. Figurative density is patterned early (slumbering titan, unblooming petals) and paid off in the unheard symphony. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under stress (“He held his breath”). Filter verbs minimal; syntax flexes from long lyrical coils to staccato beats at the lunge. Voice never drifts into committee-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is compressed, mythic, yet idiosyncratic: “rusted heart finally still, lights flickering out like forgotten stars.” Patterned elision (no articles, stacked noun phrases) taught in opening sentence and sustained, paid off in final cadence. Perceptual signature—Liora clocks colour saturation, scale-sheen, ink smell—remains consistent under stress. No head-hop; single POV holds.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, tactile, and rhythmically controlled: “cathedral of brass and silence,” “scent of oil hung thick as incense” teach a liturgical cadence that suits both archive and fable. Perceptual signature is archival—every object is cataloged by texture, age, and use-history, anchoring POV consistency. Compression (“ink drying on parchment”) and patterned elision (names vanish as read) are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to distort voice; interior monologue stays within archivist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited interiority is stable; no head-hop. Syntax grows fragmentary under pressure (“His fingers trembled. / The stone’s light flared…”) mirroring mapper’s sensorial overload. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a cave-reading hermit—no corporate register. Perceptual signature is tactile-mineral: light is “trapped lightning,” silence is a “bloom,” song is “storm”—consistent metaphor field. Rhythm modulates from long exhalations to staccato pulses as beings recoil, aligning prose with breath.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical yet precise register—"thistle-blown moment," "salt wind worn thin"—that feels idiosyncratic to the custodian’s retrocognitive gaze. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for ascent, staccato fragments at flare ("it *mended*—not perfectly, but enough"). No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Perceptual signature is consistent—she senses echoes, not futures—and the final line relinquishes the pavilion’s song without sentimental linger, proving control.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-essay yet stays within an archivist’s plausible lexicon (“preemptively nostalgic,” “conjecture,” “refracted”). Perceptual signature is consistent: attention to shadow length, rain echo, crystal hum—never tourist-catalog. Rhythm modulates from long, sonorous sentences to the clipped final four-word paragraph, mirroring release of breath. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal monologue avoids filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person limited stays close to Liora’s perceptions: “petals like embers caught in slow motion.” Chant rhythm threads through syntax, modulating under pressure. No head-hops; diction remains within artisan traveler’s lexicon. Filter verbs serve voice (“she smelled,” “she saw”) without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, tidal, rhythmically varied; long breath-like sentences mirror tide retreat, single-drop sentences act as pin-pricks. Perceptual signature is flawlessly maintained—chronicler sees everything as shell, ripple, anemone. No dialogue to distort distance; free indirect style stays cool and exact. Compression in “world was holding its breath” is taught early and paid off in submerged dream, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lyric-compressed diction (“taste of beginning”) stays within a cloistered child’s plausible lexicon while maintaining elevated poetic license. Rhythm clusters tight enjambment during climbs versus caesura-breaths inside bunker, mirroring lung constriction. Perceptual signature isolates sound-as-taste, a memorable filter not borrowed from stock lyric SF. No dialogue to contaminate voice; narration never leaks adult omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close adheres to Elias’s perceptual signature: he clocks noise levels by brass dial, tastes canal water, sees dusk “fractured into a thousand quiet refractions.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during vial hiss, longer cadences during drift. No head-hop; passenger interior inaccessible, as Elias would. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for self-taught canal man (“recalibrated,” “confluence” borderline but lyrical height feels intentional). Dialogue minimal, natural when spoken: “It doesn’t erase it… gives it somewhere to go” lands as compressed wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close keeps tight psychic distance; diction (“equations for bending perception,” “ozone and old metal”) stays within scholar POV without register drift. Rhythm escalates—short clauses for descent, then longer release as she walks away. No dialogue, avoiding pitfalls; interiority avoids filter verbs. Minor echo: “the flake…flake’s resonance” in adjacent sentences; otherwise syntactic variety supports momentum. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical, compressed, taught early (“shadows didn’t just gather, they breathed”) and paid off. Rhythm escalates toward staccato fragments under pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature remains stable. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric-cinematic compression taught by first sentence; maintained through fragmented yet coherent syntax. Perceptual signature is tactile-heat, metallic taste, ozone scent—Lina-specific, not generic. No dialogue, so voice purity rides rhythm: clause-fragment build-ups mirror rising glow. Register stays within survivor-street smart lexicon; no academic drift. Final “door” image earns its metaphoric leap via prior portal imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—book-spine metaphors, acoustic metaphors—feels scholar-specific. Rhythm swells and narrows with procedural tension: short actions (“He struck it once—sharp, like a tuning fork”) against longer reflective swells. No filter-verb clutter; diction remains within erudite but not showy register. Lyric compression is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to the knight’s perceptual filter: “metal whispering,” “color no human eye had named.” Syntax warps under pressure—sentence fragments mirror the *UNSNAP* command. No dialogue, so voice purity is total; diction (“rotten silk,” “sigils,” “hungry”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm accelerates into the final line without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—sour coffee scent, manila spine texture, the way paper dust “settles like fallen snow.” Syntax mirrors his methodical temperament: long sentences for cataloguing, a fragment (“It was a small thing.”) for the mailed gift. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is on narrative texture; diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon without sudden thesaurus lifts. Rhythm modulates—compressed envelope scene accelerates—without monotony, satisfying 9+ quick test for perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, starlit cadence with satisfying compression: “the receiver dangling like a broken promise.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Lena notices reflections, static, receipts. Micro-register slips (“tyranny of indifference”) flirt with thesis-speak but occur only once; overall texture stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“leaves began to fall in earnest now, not drifting but *spelling*”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices texture, weight, and song of seeds; her diction never drifts into academic or corporate register. Compression (“She jumped.”) accelerates the climax without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is tactile, precise, slightly antique without pastiche: “black as a held breath,” “tuning fork struck against fate.” Perceptual signature—metal, salt, ember—stays consistent under pressure. Syntax accelerates during the drop and lands in short, declarative release: “He let it go.” No dialogue to distort cadence; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Experimental compressions (“uncertainly certain”) are taught early and paid off in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is alchemist-cool: “factually mystical” self-mocking, “zodiac coin” treated as reagent not relic. Rhythm tightens under pressure—single syllable clusters (“She uncorked the vial now”) mirror pulse rise. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Liora-bound. Filter verbs serve voice (“the coin answered”) rather than dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited clings to Liora’s perceptual signature: her world is judged by acoustic texture and tooth-temperature, never visual dominance. Sentence rhythm mimics breath-hold and release—long inhalations of clause, then punched joke. No head-hop; spectral voice is filtered through her interpretation. Filter verbs (“she realized”) appear only at the moment knowledge flips, justified by internal beat. Dialogue is minimal, subtextual, and tonally distinct from narration.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is trauma-tuned: proprioceptive hyper-awareness, synesthetic taste of burnt copper, diction of “live wire,” “ledger of absences.” Syntax compresses under pressure—fragments like “It hadn’t.”—then widens into lyrical cadence for closure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. UV-thread sewing, “serrated silence,” and pewter-darkened-to-violet show fresh metaphor without purple drift. Voice remains stable in 3rd-close past; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic noticing (scent of rain before it falls, hum of bridge stress) remains Lior-specific. Compression (“time moved differently”, “dead language lullaby”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final firefly-like flickers. No head-hopping; distance holds steady in close-third lyricism. Dialogue is minimal but carries indirection—“Unfasten the past” functions as imperative and warning, matching painter’s elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s technician sensorium—measured breath, finger-width estimates, dust grammars—so perceptual signature is sharp. Rhythm mirrors tension: long clause to open, then staccato fragments as gears drop. No head-hop; ghosts’ dialogue is filtered through his perception. Compression (“He didn’t ask what. He knew.”) is taught early and pays off in the final silent exit.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric distance sustains omniscient foreknowledge compatible with mythic tone yet stays anchored to Elias’s perceptual filter (“ink wasn’t ink at all, but liquid time”). Syntax compresses under pressure—“He wasn’t just printing words—he was compressing eternity”—mirroring press mechanics. No head-hopping; library’s hum is externalized thought. Voice never explains itself; pattern is taught by repetition of glass/frost/whisper triad.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s poet-perceiver: syntax lengthens during reverie, fragments under shard-fracture. Diction—“baroque spires,” “burnished sorrow”—is writerly yet consistent with a poet-architect. Taelis’s single line is sharp, academic, distinct. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from panoramic asteroid shot to wrist-pulse. Filter verbs appear only when motivated (“Elias felt the shard warm”), never excessive. Rhythm mirrors emotional swell: long sentences pre-vision, staccato at dust-release.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is alchemic-musical: syntax coils like springs—“brass walls vibrating with the ghost of a melody”—and cadence accelerates under pressure without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is repairman-specific: noticing seams, solder, tangles of gears. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; “fishhook in the ribs” is visceral yet artisanal. No filter-verb stacks; elision (“He should have known then”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: short, paratactic sentences mimic the tactile pings of psychometry. Diction stays within Elias’s sensorium—ozone, pennies, wet stone—never venturing into abstract academese. Rhythm accelerates into breathlessness during the inversion, then relaxes into the final hush, mirroring emotional arc. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Elias’s skin-level perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature: “turbine-hum filled his skull,” “layers… a scaffold of simplicity.” Syntax lengthens then compresses with storm tempo; no head-hop. Diction—“timewoven,” “salt-crusted”—is consistent with a sculptor who sees grain and gesture. Final sentence cadence mirrors the loom: long breath, then clipped gift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: color, scent, temperature. Sentence rhythm mimics breath-holding and release; patterned "hush" repetitions are taught early and pay off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Psychic distance stable; diction painterly yet within her lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, POV-bound: “brass hull groaning like an old man’s bones,” “ink bleeding into the shape of screams.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress—short clauses during officers’ approach. Register stays within Elias’s lexicon; no academic drift. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: officer’s “trespassing on restricted memory” vs. Elias’s silent shell answer. Pattern of marine/salt imagery taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distilled, alchemical: syntax leans toward aphoristic compression (“comfort was a lie, a sugar-coating”) yet flexes into tactile immediacy when the child’s hand leaves honey-salt residue. Perceptual signature is elderly, synesthetic, salt-bitten. No dialogue to corrupt cadence; internal monologue stays strictly within his lexicon. The rhythmic escalation from hush to market-clatter mirrors the town’s re-birth without breaking psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is compressed, winter-lean, with strategic fragments—“Not pried, not forced—decreased.”—that teach the entropy pattern early. Lexicon stays inside Liora’s seed-ledger world: “slow hunger of roots,” “seed-hoard,” “minnow in her grip.” No dialogue, so perceptual signature carries all: she notices joints, feathers, ozone, starlight in a order that reveals her priorities. Rhythm accelerates into the root eruption, then exhales with the single sentence “Outside, the first leaves began to unfold”—a cadence shift that mirrors the vortex reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at intimate distance, syntax tightening under pressure—“He pulled. / The bell’s voice shattered”—mimicking cardiac rhythm. Lexicon stays within Elias’s artisanal range; no filter-verb stacks. Wind howls function as choral punctuation rather than dialogue, so voice remains uncontaminated.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Eli’s perceptual filter: “ghostly heat linger on his skin,” “scent of ozone and old metal.” Rhythm swells with participial cadence during meteor sigh, then shortens to declarative stride at departure—pattern taught early, paid off in final still line.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: cracked lens, metallic taste of rust, mirror face that isn’t his. Syntax mirrors obsession—long, filament-like sentences that coil like the staircase. No dialogue to distort voice; the garage-sale labels speak in fragmentary aphorisms that feel etched, not spoken. Register never drifts above Elias’s taciturn, tool-lean diction.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains a consistent perceptual signature—sound/vision condensed through oil-on-water, prism-on-vane metaphors. Syntax modulates with tension: longer clauses for lagoon reverie, staccato fragments during kite crash. Psychic distance stays tight; no filter-verb clusters intrude. Diction stays within a poet’s plausible lexicon; the elevated register is justified by the contemplative frame. Voice is distinctive, though a hair’s breadth below 9+ because the rhythm, while musical, does not tighten under pressure—the closing cadence is more lull than torque.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric third-person hovers at Elira’s shoulder, filtering world through gardener’s tactile lexicon: “lovers,” “ribs,” “breath.” Syntax grows shorter as her breath thins, rhythm echoing exertion. No head-hop; Tomas’s skepticism arrives as observed gesture, not internal ventriloquism. Copper’s chime and leaf tremor are perceptual signatures distinct to this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    Third-person limited stays welded to the coachman’s weathered diction: “fine silt of drowned things,” “syllables curling…like smoke from damp kindling.” Perceptual signature—sea-taste, bird-angle, soil hum—never slips into tourist catalog. Rhythm mirrors tidal pulse: long swells of description break into fragmentary whispers (“Grow…”) under pressure. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived; when he mimics tern cries the syntax itself keens. Pattern-taught elision (absent verbs in dream list) is paid off in final sapling lean.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Rook’s sensory palette; no head-hop. Diction is lyrical yet canine-true (“sniffing out the dead,” “muzzle brushing”). Rhythm modulates: longer, clause-rich sentences for prophecy, clipped fragments for physical immediacy. The patterned repetition of grooved script / grooved wax / grooved glass teaches the reader to read by texture, paid off when grooves literally pull him inside. Voice remains distinct under pressure; zero dialogue prevents register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline: breath fog warps starlight, metal contracts, compass “wakes”—all filtered through an observer’s precise, lonely attention. Rhythm accelerates into breath-short fragments as she steps off, then elongates in the light-bloom sentence—mirrors time stretch without dropping clarity. No dialogue, yet voice remains idiosyncratic and stable. Patterned elision (“echoed silence”) is taught early and paid off in the underwater chime.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric yet precise: “needle of black ice piercing the belly of the wrong sky” teaches the world’s physics and the narrator’s poetic perceptual signature in one breath. Rhythm modulates—long fever-dream sentences compress into the spare swap dialogue—mirroring ascent vs decision. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to Lirien’s numbed senses. Compression (“She didn’t say it aloud”) efficiently handles exposition without breaking cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature—architectural acoustics filtered through grief-archivist senses—remains distinct; diction (“drifting shadow that swallowed cities whole”) shows rhythmic control without register drift. Compression taught early (“remember, unbind, tell”) and paid off in final “home”. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Ellipsis and fragment use (“They *ascended*.”) voice-motivated, taught by cadence of whispers. Under peak stress syntax shortens, mirroring breath—no mechanical template detected.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is mercury-silver throughout: every noticed thing warps, reflects, or leaves metallic trace, aligning syntax with sight. Figurative language is disciplined—never more than one image per sentence in peak beats—so metaphor heightens rather than clogs. No dialogue, hence no register slippage; narration stays within a seer’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into short, unadorned clauses at the door-crossing, mirroring breathless stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrichromatic third-person hovers close to tutor’s sensory filter: “frayed threads of the woven hush.” Syntax mirrors fidget—short en-dash bursts, clause-stacking. Rhythm breathes with scene: frantic tug-sentences slow into hearth-side cadence. No dialogue till the girl’s single line; its plainness contrasts effectively with ornate surround, keeping voice distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“walls of bone humming”) and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic: dust, vibration, echo. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within Liora’s artisan lexicon (sigil, chalk, carve). A few hyphenated compounds (“bone-dust,” “needle-drawn”) risk mannerism but read as consistent poetic license.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>High density: “condensation of a thousand held breaths” does three jobs—image, stakes, world rule. Rhythm accelerates with short paratactic clauses during climb; longer sentence collapses into scream-crescendo. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (spire as mirror, salt dissolution). Only micro-slip: “forged hush” is lovely but abstract; its meaning is felt, not defined, requiring reader leap.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is dense, lyrical, compressed—yet every metaphor is anchored to POV perception: “pockmarks...like a scream frozen mid-birth” is exact visual of stone scar, not ornament. Rhythm escalates from long breathy clauses to fragment shards as sea eats floor, mirroring rising panic. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains tight to alchemist’s sensory funnel. Non-standard punctuation (em-dash cascades) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final—silence—break.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s painter perception: colors, textures, light. Voice modulates: short clauses under lantern shadows, lyrical elongation at pool reveal. No head-hop; knowledge stays character-bound—he guesses villagers will call it suicide. Syntax mirrors mental state: stacked participles when painting, fragment-breaths at water’s edge. Filter verbs used only when painterly (“saw it: a cavern…”) and serve immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: maritime metaphors (“like a bruise against the pale dawn”) and synesthetic slips (scent as sound) stay within Elias’s keeper-bred sensorium. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for the scent-ritual, staccato “He didn’t answer” under Harkin’s challenge. No head-hopping; Harkin’s softness is observed from Elias’s stance. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“Elias breathed in”).

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, salt-bitten, rhythmically controlled—“rusted antennae swaying…humming with the ghosts of transmissions”—yet stays within Lena’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is selective: she notices oxidation bloom, graph-paper grids, tide-echo in her ribs. Dialogue is minimal, rough as gravel, distinct from narrative texture; no head-hopping. Compression (e.g., “Midnight calls were never for the living”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at the candle-lit close.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, syntactically varied—fragments (“Not hiding. / Making it harder to see.”) mirror the staccato of a mind that must think faster than its tongue. Perceptual signature is tactile-olfactory: “gnarled branches swaying… fruit heavy with… something older.” No head-hop; distance stays tight interior. Diction stays inside Lior’s rural forager lexicon except the deliberate relic idiom. Rhythm accelerates under pressure then exhales into the final long sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: maritime lexicon, lighthouse physics, synesthetic shift of scent into visible memory. Syntax modulates—long breathless sentences under magnification, staccato climb of spiral stairs. No dialogue, so voice coherence rides on interior monologue that never exceeds POV lexicon. Compression “opal dock…half-remembered dream” teaches lyric pattern paid off in final beam sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close maintains Elias’s empirical optic: “measured worth in margins and age,” tactile wariness of myth. Syntax lengthens for wonder, fragments under foxfire flare. No head-hop; perceptual signature sustained. Dialogue minimal, voice-apt. Diction stays within dealer lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is dense, heated, and alchemical—verbs like “hummed,” “thickened,” “rooted” keep the syntax sinuous. Compression is purposeful: elided articles (“the breath curling into the chill like a question”) are taught early and hold to the end. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to Elias’s tactile synesthesia. Only a few template cadences (“It wasn’t… It was…”) prevent the final 0.2 lift to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory filtering through a man who experiences time as palimpsest—“dreams started documenting him.” Syntax mirrors fragmentation—em-dashes, italic self-interruptions, clause-stacking—yet never obscures causality. Diction stays inside Elias’s lexicon (rune, glyph, static, scab) without external register drift. Rhythmic control peaks at burn-beat: single-word sentences “Ash settled.” / “The fire guttered.” compress tension without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual signature: smells are remembered, gears are tasted on the tongue, fog is heard rather than seen. Syntax mirrors clockwork—balanced clauses, metronomic “between” repetitions—then relaxes into longer breath as fog lifts. No filter-verb clutter; “he thought” is used once to license the epiphany, then discarded. Woman’s diction is distinguishably plainer, marking class and urgency; convergence at the whispered thanks is brief and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lingers in Mara’s sensory idiom—gossip ink, silver nib, twilight perfume—without head-hop. Syntax flexes from short percussive lines under tension to longer breaths at dawn, mirroring pulse of magic. Dialogue is sparse but carries indirection (“Stay for the dawn?” answered with a planting condition). No register drift; diction stays within singer-touched archivist lexis.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is perceptual, metallic, salt-stiffened: “gears groaning… water through veins of copper pipe.” Syntax shortens under stress—counting fragments—without losing clarity. No head-hop; free indirect stays clean. Diction stays within clock-keeper lexicon; “chronometric anomalies” is Bureau jargon that Elias would plausibly mock-internally.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; perceptual signature is precise—Lena “sees” in network topologies, feels strap edges, hears “hum of familiar strangers.” Syntax compresses under pressure (“She pressed the laser button, not to cut…”) without losing clarity; patterned elision (“they’re talking… like… old friends”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; Elias stays opaque in gesture, fitting single-POV. Voice modulates from tech-tinged diction toward translucent quiet by finale.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature strong: mathematics metaphors ("shattered hypothesis") and synesthetic scent-logic ("smells like burnt clover") feel Lila-specific. Rhythmic compression under intensity: "The library dissolved. / For a breath…" teaches reader to accept fragmentary elision. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free indirect stays clean; filter verbs justified by cerebral POV. Consistent stance—ironically rational gambler—held to final line.

    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—sound-first, skin-second, sight-last. Syntax mirrors his hunched patience: long sentences for listening, fragments when the disc sings. Diction stays inside his lexicon (“glass harmonica disc,” not “singing bowl”). Dialogue is minimal yet voice-distinguishable: caller’s “I don’t know how to hang up” is the only lyrical intrusion, marking her as surface-world. No head-hop; even the rat’s claws are heard, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is color- and texture-obsessed, befitting an ink-worker. Syntax is rhythmic, clause-stacked, yet never drifts from POV lexicon. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains idiosyncratic. Compression (“stars were just holes…”) feels taught, not mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lean, lyric, perceptually specific—“boots crunch on glass that had once been a ticket booth window” compresses history and触感 in one stride.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is perceptually signature: salt/copper taste, bark as braille, compass that pulses warmth. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences absorb, then abrupt stop when music ceases, mirroring heartbeat. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Elian’s fingertips. Diction stays within blind cartographer’s sensorium; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature—cosmic rewriter who tastes ozone and hears star punctuation—stays consistent; diction (“universe rewriting itself,” “unbending moments”) belongs to Elias alone. No dialogue, hence no contamination. Compression taught early (“low vibration that settled in Elias’s ribs”) and paid off in final heartbeat image. Syntax modulates: long lyric sentences for anomaly flashes, clipped fragments at realization.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical third-person hovers just above Elias’s perceptual field, filtering every detail through sign-language kinetics and chromatic sound. Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long wave sentences crash against fragment flashes. No head-hop; Liora’s interior is read only through her camera-stance and velvet-blade diction, maintaining distance. Patterned elision (“signs for sounds that had no voice”) taught early and paid off in color-chords.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is compressed, incantatory, POV-locked: “archive smelled of charred parchment and old regret” establishes perceptual signature. Syntax mirrors descent: long fever-dream clauses narrow to match-strike fragments. Diction stays within Elias’s esoteric lexicon; no filter-verb drift. Unreliability is subtle—he hides the ledger’s meaning from himself until the seam opens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric with tight psychic distance: diction (“auric lagoon,” “synapses like stolen constellations”) stays within Lira’s perceptual register—synesthetic, musical, slightly hallucinated. Rhythm mirrors pressure: long hypnotic sentences build, then fragment at release (“Then another. / And another.”). No head-hop; universe inhales with her, a permitted figurative merge that pays off the taught pattern. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“the water remembered”) and reinforce premise rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: goggles tint neon, gravel frost *crunches*, aurora bleeds color, all filtered through a man who catalogues *limps* before names. Syntax tightens under pressure—"not toward her, but *past* her"—mirroring the refusal to confront head-on. Free indirect stays clean: "Lior wasn’t lost; he *maintained* the maze" carries his professional pride without external commentary. No head-hop; when the woman speaks, we remain outside her interior, preserving Lior’s epistemic limits.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers at coherent psychic distance; guardian’s perceptual signature is “spiralingly calm,” filtering every notice through light and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyrical compression—“He unfolded”—teaches the pattern of bodily elision early and pays it off at transformation. Perceptual signature is dockworker-anchored: notice goes to tide-pull, crate weight, rope bite. No head-hopping; collective “they” stays external. Rhythm modulates from gritty Anglo-Saxon nouns to liquid sibilance post-shift, mirroring medium change. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“seemed to say”) they signal species-to-species translation uncertainty, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature: performer’s eye for staging (“chorus of mechanical mourning”), hospital-flashback idiom. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for held breath, fragments at scream.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is irreplaceable: compressed lyric syntax, tactile verbs (“unspooling,” “thawed behind her”), and a perceptual signature that hears light *bleed*. Compression never loosens into purple; every figurative layer pays off in the final quartz glow. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. POV distance holds—third-person intimate with access only to Elira’s sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a controlled free-indirect glide that stays inside Elias’s perceptual idiom: “numbers were just another kind of symbol,” “patterns didn’t lie, but they didn’t explain themselves either.” Compression—“liquid prisms,” “ inherited mystery of things once valued”—is taught early and never obfuscates. Rhythm modulates: longer, rain-pattered sentences for reflection, staccato fragments at the click of the tape. No dialogue clutter; the single spoken line (“Stories are how patterns survive”) is laconic, subtext-laden, and unrepeated, preserving vocal scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrically compressed yet precise—“atoms of nostalgia,” “held-breath hum”—with rhythmic control that accelerates into the scream. Perceptual signature is consistent: the historian notices via tactile bronze, dying light, and scent; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: Liora notices “the exact moment day surrendered,” tracks shadows “as if they were living things.” Rhythm modulates—long, breath-held sentences under pressure, then short release: “She set the stone on the windowsill.” No dialogue, so voice purity is never contaminated by speech-craft; the curator’s whisper is filtered through Liora’s ear, maintaining distance control. Diction stays within her lexicon—“softly deliberate,” “sharp-eyed dusk noticer”—and the lyrical pattern is taught early, paid off in the final merging.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s perceptual filter: marigold scent, tremor in chest, starlight through fogged glass. Diction—“jagged absence like a half-told lie”—is character-specific, not writerly flourish. No dialogue, so voice texture is carried by rhythmic, breath-controlled syntax that mirrors salve application. Filter verbs appear only when they serve tactile immediacy (“felt the tremor”). No head-hop; psychic distance tightens across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: coffee rings as “concentric confessions,” ivy “thin with thirst,” tower beams whispering of dragged-from earth. Syntax grows clipped under stress—“Sand hissed onto the sill, counting down to something”—then lengthens into the final hush. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly Liora-bound. Register never drifts above her lived lexicon; vegetal voices slither, never “communicate.”

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyrical, pattern-taught compression (“reels…ghostly flicker…lyrics slipped away like your name”) maintains perceptual signature throughout. Syntax mirrors sprocket rhythm: fragments when film stutters, longer coils when memory unwinds. No head-hopping; unreliability accrues through selective sensory narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is a perceptual signature: syntax lengthens and compresses with wind-shifts; diction stays within philosopher’s metaphysical lexicon. Ellipsis and en-dash fragments teach the pattern by line 3 and pay off in the final breath-unit “only gears / only hums.” No head-hopping; psychic distance glides from exterior observation to interior synesthesia without filter-verb sludge. Rhythm is the hum—sentence cadence becomes the frequency he surrenders to.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—metronome lantern, held-breath ridge. Patterned elision (“the ridgeway seemed to breathe”) is taught early and legitimates the final twilight-held note without head-hop.

No head-hopping; pianist viewed only through Elias’s interpretive lens, preserving distance and mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)

Syntax stays controlled; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice carries a technician’s compressed lyric: “millimeter increments,” “depth readings flatlined,” yet can pivot to “ghost of a shoreline” without register drift. Perceptual signature is sharp—Lena sees the world as data first, myth second; the narration keeps that hierarchy. There is no dialogue; hence dialogue bullets are waived. Syntax mirrors tide: longer sentences for slow rise, staccato fragments when water recedes, all taught early and paid off at the road-reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lena; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is concrete and idiosyncratic—“toes curling against the grit,” “hinge creaking like an old man’s joints.” Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences in calm, staccato bursts during hum surge. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Dialogue is brief but natural; scout’s single line advances the ignition beat. Voice distinct enough for 8-band, lacks the final sonic punch that would hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)

    Voice is compression-poetic—“breath curling like smoke,” “time stretched thin like a bowstring”—yet stays inside a tracker’s perceptual palette. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Syntax modulates: longer lyrical lines for suspended time, fragment bursts at the step-through. Experimental elision (“for three days, then reappeared in the same instant”) is taught early and paid off at exit. Minor rhythmic echo of “then he... then he...” in two adjacent sentences, not enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close maintains cryogenic archivist perceptual signature: temperature, metal smells, date misalignment obsession. Syntax alternates between compressed clauses under pressure and lyric spill at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is Elara-specific: needle-scar constellations, firmware hiss in ears, resin-cracked palms. Compression is taught early (“laboratory hummed like a dying star”) and stays legible; clauses telescope without sacrificing clarity. Perceptual signature narrows to sound and touch under stress, matching grief’s sensory distortion. No head-hop; the one-line voice from air is the firmware objectified, not an omniscient intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)

Syntax tightens under stress: “The sliver grew heavier. She understood.” No head-hopping; Mira’s laughter is external texture, not interior intrusion. Register stays within an artist’s lexicon; only micro-slip: “willowglass hope” is coined but justified by prior light-palette logic.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is crystalline, lyric, yet anchored in mapper lexicon—“sensory map maker,” “factually mystical,” “heat-mapping emotions.” Rhythm flexes with pressure: short clauses for burn-moment, elongated cadence for cave inhale.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet precise, never purple: “veined with fossilized resin that glowed faintly…like trapped sunlight” is sensorily efficient. Rhythmic control matches pressure—short clauses when Elias lowers the needle, longer sinewy sentences during reverie.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct—synesthesia of sound into touch (“static that wasn’t random…a code written in tremors”) and mortician diction (“hollows of her hands,” “curve of her collarbone”).

Syntax mirrors synesthesia—“the sound of the waves… shimmered”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the underwater breach and slows for the frozen-sky tableau. Diction remains within a lamplighter’s plausible lexicon yet coins new sensory verbs. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. The final sentence’s coinage “shimmered” for sound is earned through prior pattern, satisfying 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is pattern-seeking, sound-oriented, with restrained diction that modulates into lyric cadence at the climax. No head-hopping or register drift. The final whisper keeps voice coherence while allowing the cosmic scale shift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is bone-dry, maritime-gothic: “the groan of a ship’s hull splitting” as Leviathan’s first utterance constructs a perceptual signature inseparable from the reaper’s vocation. Rhythm tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mimic wax-cylinder crackle: “He played it again. / The reaper wasn’t supposed to remember. / But he did.” No head-hop; the camera stays inside the hollow of his ribs. Diction stays within a deathless sailor’s lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Elision (“He did not look back”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final line’s coiling shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close focalization is stable; perceptual signature is mage-math (“droplets fell faster at dawn, slower at dusk, as if the stone itself breathed”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses when bell hums, longer when bay wakes. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven (“he reasoned,” “he knew”).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elias’s perceptual tics: color of held breath, scent as confession, copper chime as heartbeat.

The wind-chime’s single note is the only spoken sound, making silence a character.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)

No dialogue, so voice coherence is high; no head-hopping. Free-indirect bursts (“*There*, she thought”) are clean and motive. Rhythmic control peaks in the final chord “across the bones of the earth.”

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: *“spaces between sounds,”* *“weight of absence,”* *“lattice of pressure points.”* Rhythm modulates—long lyric sentences aloft, staccato micro-actions on branch—mirroring altitude and risk. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (*“she noticed ozone”*) not dilution. Final whisper *“pattern isn’t in the noise”* crystallizes idiom without ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person hovers at knife-edge distance: close enough to feel pulse in amber, wide enough to register banners burning below. Diction—“vivify the severed,” “conceptual repricing”—stays within monk lexicon without sliding into RPG jargon. Rhythm tightens under stress: spondaic clusters (“blood welled, dark and slow”) mimic heartbeat. No dialogue bloat; Veyra’s three clipped speeches contrast Kael’s compressed interior, keeping voice distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)

Reliability is intact; no knowledge is withheld for fake suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-close psychic distance stays stable; diction (“time slippery,” “words crawling like ants”) is character-bound. Rhythm accelerates with short paratactic bursts under peak stress: “She laughed, because the terror was familiar...” No head-hop. Lyric compression taught early (“mist was new”) and paid off at dissolution. Dialogue minimal, voice-like: “You’ve been holding my key” carries subtext of ownership vs. servitude.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly coiled to Elias’s perceptual signature: “lung pausing mid-breath,” “light filtered through bruised skin.” Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments at climax: “The explosion was silent.” No head-hopping; diction never exceeds alchemical lexicon. Micro-distinction: guildmaster’s single line carries bureaucratic condescension, Elias’s reply is liturgical, marking status shift.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric compression (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”) teaches its pattern early and pays off in the reversed-gravity cadence; perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s noticing is always tuned to frequency over form.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is salted-mariner lyrical: “blade through silk,” “starlight pulsed like schools of fish.” Compresses without scaffold—every coil of rope or crackle of radio does double duty. Perceptual signature steady: Lira notices time, patterns, passenger edges. No head-hop; diction stays within her weathered lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-technical, equal parts art-installation manual and erotic reverie; syntax stretches without breaking: “a blackness that hummed.” Perceptual signature sharp—Elias gauges distance by thread tension, time by scent fade. Compression taught early (“realistically imaginary”) and paid off at closure. Zero head-hop; woman’s interior stays opaque, maintaining distance control. Only micro-slip: “pulse didn’t quicken” is filter-phrase that momentarily dulls visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric yet ocean-tech precise: “grooves of a thousand submerged maps,” “razor’s edge of stone.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action—rhythmic control supports pressure.

Distinctive diction (“echoes weren’t meant to stay buried”) remains consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)

Instead, he pressed…”—then exhales in the final paragraph. No head-hopping; POV stays latched to Elias’s nerve-endings. Lexicon stays within a salvage-tech frame: phase seam, detector hiss, illuminant gold—precise without sounding encyclopedic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught from line 1: “copper-veined storyteller” signals metallic diction that persists to the last fractured note. Syntax mirrors breathless inhalation of echoes—clause stacks mimic wind-gusts—yet remains legible. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent: Veyra feels language as texture, sees birds as cipher, never slips into tourist-catalog gaze. Final line cadence—“echoes…forget how to die”—delivers Charged Poise with rhythmic certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice sustains a lush, synesthetic cadence—“gravitationally playful,” “harmony untamed”—that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the blooming flower’s impossible tune. Diction stays within Elias’s researcher-observer lexicon while bending toward incantation. No head-hopping; herbalist’s voice stays external. Minor register drift: “cosmic joke” verges on thesis-statement but is saved by being spoken by the antagonistic phone.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric POV stays tight to violinist’s perceptual lens; no head-hop. Diction skews to tactile verbs (clung, trembling, sinking) matching bodily crisis. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed fragments during ground-split, then exhales into longer sentences—mirrors her heartbeat cadence. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she watched them rise, then turned”) but justified by need to reset gaze; voice remains singular.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited adheres to Lior’s perceptual bias—sound as texture, light as weight. Syntax mirrors his patience: long clauses when smoothing wood, fragment-short when halo found.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is crystalline, slightly archaic (“ink-stained cuffs,” “liquid amber”) yet internally coherent. Perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—Elias sees “Euclid’s Lament” and measures sighs. No head-hopping; even the mother’s whisper issues from the scarf, not omniscience. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for wonder, staccato “The air thickened. / The scarf’s edges blurred.” for pressure. A hairline slip into elevated diction (“hyperbolic geometry made manifest”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is fierce: “fingers stained with the ghosts of ink,” “light spilled through the lens and stitched,” “palette flared—once, twice—like a match in a hurricane.” Syntax flexes with emotional tempo—long breathless clauses for dawn compression, two-beat fragments for flare extinction—yet stays legible.

Experimental elision (“she wasn’t here to catalog books”) is taught early and paid off when the blank volume is finally labeled—reader trusts the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice: lyrical compression, folkloric diction (“salt and rot,” “drowned leviathan”) consistent with scholar-romantic stance.

No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal free indirect clean.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Elspeth’s perceptual signature—“counting the ribs of a sleeping beast”—with rhythmic, lexically precise cadence. Filter verbs serve voice (“the shadow hissed” via Kael’s perception) without dulling immediacy. Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual; Elspeth’s clipped lines pursue mentoring goals. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under threat (“heart-beat ripple”), then widens to playground hush, mirroring tension release.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: calloused palms, knife-hum, branch-angle noticing. Syntax mirrors pruning rhythm—short cuts, then lyrical spillover.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic cadences that mirror the weaving/unweaving action. Lexicon stays within Elias’s artisanal diction—needle-eye, salt, knot, silk—no register drift.

Filter verbs (“seemed to whisper”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences weld sensory, metaphoric, and causal work—“ink bled into nothingness, dividing the known coast from the uncharted gray beyond.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is fractally compressed, each sentence a shard of sensory exactitude: “sap and mildew,” “breaths pressed into metal.” Rhythmic control heightens under pressure—short clauses during collapse, then the long release of “the color of a sky that had finally learned to stay.” Perceptual signature is painterly-tactile, never visual-first: she “scores the wood with channels to guide the beams.” No head-hopping; the tight third-person stays inside her finger-seeing skin until the final wide shot.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV stays tight third-person locked to the locksmith; perceptual signature is tactile-metal: gears “sigh,” oil smells of “burnt sugar and old storms,” brass key teeth are “crescent moon.” Syntax mirrors her precision—short clauses for gear-work, longer breaths for memory.

Compression under pressure: “She reached in. / The water didn’t resist.”—two blunt beats that accelerate the climax without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cosmic-orchard register: “fruit pulsed with starlight,” “wings shimmered like shattered moons.” Syntax modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato final chalk line, mirroring the shift from wonder to commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—time is tasted as amber glow, heard as throat-clearing sigh. Rhythmic control mirrors emotional pressure: long clauses stretch during hesitation, then fracture into sentence fragments as the beam collapses.

Diction remains within a lighthouse keeper’s plausible lexicon even at lyrical heights.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close hovers at a lyric distance that matches Liora’s solitary vigilance; perceptual signature is selective—she clocks joint stiffness in brass birds, frost timing to the minute. Syntax stays lean, then frays slightly in the final paragraph to mimic fatigue. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register remains within her lived lexicon; “stone throat” is the lone poetic reach, forgiven by context.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Narrative texture is musical—rhythmic clauses mirror metronomic clock gears; diction stays within Liora’s lexicon (choir, sheet music, “afterglow”).

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric, compressed diction (“quaking reverie,” “silver scalpel”) remains internally consistent; diction skews poetic but stays within an engineer sensibility by privileging optical and tactile metaphors. Rhythm tightens then releases in the final long sentence, mirroring mental expansion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Liora’s olfactory conscience; no head-hop. Syntax coils like smoke—long sentences for inhalation, fragments for beat-timed steals.

Syntax lengthens and contracts with loom rhythm—long clauses while weaving, abrupt fragments at the crack of amber. No head-hop; the distant lover’s POV is framed as external tableau, maintaining distance control. Patterned elision (“—not sound, but the shape of it”) is taught early and paid off in the dust image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the smith; perceptual signature is tactile—trembling palms, calloused hands, hiss of forge—never ventriloquizing planet or crowd.

    Lyrical-elliptical voice taught early (“tracing a scar—silent, precise”) and sustained: rhythmic dip of oars, breath-held green. Diction stays inside Elias’s laconic, salt-stripped lexicon; no register drift. Perceptual signature—objects glow, hum, pulse—mirrors his sensory starvation. Compression (“skiff would rot”) reads as purposeful elision, paid off at closure. Minor template cadence in stone-stacking repetitions prevents 9.0.

Filter verbs (“she noticed”) serve voice rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—gloved fingers, hum of glass, ozone hush. Syntax shortens under peak tension—“He pressed the slide harder”—without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lapidary yet urgent: “glass panes streaked with the slow poison of the world above” marries lyric cadence to toxic stakes. Syntax mirrors calligraphic rhythm—long ink-stained sentences build, then snap into staccato clause fragments at pressure peaks (“He shouldn’t have. But the map didn’t lead to gold.”). Perceptual signature is consistent: a scribe who notices curl of ink, burr of metal edge, scent of old paper before anything else. Compression and elision (“He went at dusk…”) are pattern-taught early and never break causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Liora’s haptic cognition; diction of “wired bone,” “tensioned silk,” and “child’s gasp” is vivid yet precise. Rhythm modulates—long breaths versus clipped fragments—mirroring the sculpture’s acceleration. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues. Patterned elision (wind-speaks-in-sighs) is taught early and paid off at closure, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays inside Mira’s perceptual signature: brass-framed glasses slip, dust on fingers, sound of home inside metal. Rhythm modulates—long exhaling sentences at dawn, staccato “tick-tick” under pressure. No dialogue to distort voice; crowd’s murmur is reported through her filter, keeping psychic distance clean. Syntax mirrors curator precision without炫耀.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distilled, lyric, ocean-tinged: “water pressed like a held breath,” “time didn’t pass; it accumulated.” Syntax mirrors dancer’s cadence—long liquid clauses, sharp pivots at dice clatter. No head-hop; single POV stays locked to Lira’s perceptual bias (notices corrosion, cipher, whale song). Diction never exceeds drowned-scientist lexicon; compression taught early (“dice meant to be rolled, not read”) and paid off at skin-tracing finale.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is salt-grained and dock-rough: “salt crystal chamber,” “air tasted like ozone and old pennies.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—“The weight *shifted*… Not his imagination—it lurched.” No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction staying within a working-man’s lexicon. Compression and elision (“the whale—its skeleton already half-picked clean”) are taught early and paid off in the final lantern round.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic fold-cuts, water that “drinks,” night that “keeps secrets.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“snap”—then elongates into lyric release. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Tense and psychic distance stable. Patterned elision (spaces-between-words) is taught early and paid off at closure when the hush becomes breathable. Register stays within her arcane-but-tactile lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter—ink-stains, lintel sighs, meteor syllables—syntax grows clipped under the seal-burn moment, mirroring stress. Veyra’s diction is more arch but stays within mentor-trope bounds; no head-hopping. Compression like “patiently nimble” is taught early and paid off when Elias mirrors that patience in the coda, keeping rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is lyric-skeptic, compressed yet rhythmic: “the exact shade of light through the library window” is character-particular perception. Non-standard diction (“tragically radiant”, “memory keeper”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in closing cadence. No head-hopping; interior texture consistent under arrest pressure. Filter verbs serve voice: “seemed to say” preserves skepticism even at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV stays tight to forger until the Emperor’s dialogue demands shared space, then cleanly widens. Perceptual signature is specific: pearl twilight, ink like frost under dawn, tactile crumble of thorn. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, shortens at the erasure beat to mimic breath. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays locked to Veyra’s richly perceptive filter; diction (“slow pulse of bioluminescent veins,” “reed-blown melancholy”) is hers, not authorial flourish. Rhythm swells and contracts with breath and echo, mirroring singer’s craft. No head-hop; Kaelis’s interior is shown only through his cracked echo and empty eye-hollows. One micro-dip: “the universe sings its secrets to everyone” flirts with aphorism, but context keeps it in character.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings to Lena’s perceptual signature—“blue veins pulsing,” “old silver” voices—diction marine yet glacial. Rhythm contracts under pressure: fragments (“She never did”) alternate with liquid long sentences mirroring tide. No head-hopping; widow’s interior accessed only through Lena’s reading of breath and tremor. Dialogue minimal but indirection perfect: widow’s “That’s not him” carries betrayal and relief in four words.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Kael’s perceptual signature—grooves, tides, mint—then modulates when Liora’s pulse “thrummed,” her idiom younger, breath-shy. Rhythm mirrors tide: long clauses rise, fragments fall. No head-hop; knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven: “Follow it” is instruction and test. Whisk-as-spider metaphor is precise, not purple; compression stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is grimy, irradiated, sentence-level propulsive—“wind howled through skeletal trees” sets cadence. Diction stays inside Voss’s lexicon: bureaucrats, spreadsheets, valves, static. Compression taught early (“not secret cabals, but bureaucrats”) pays off in final garden inversion. No dialogue, so no register clash; perceptual signature—light-bending noticed through cracked goggles—remains consistent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is compressed, lyric, yet precise: “storm didn’t howl—it whispered” teaches the pattern and holds. Diction—“jury-rigged from salvaged war tech”—is POV-bound, never generic. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: single-word sentence “And doors could be locked. / Or opened.” No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Final laugh is unhinged yet credible under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias thinks in sounds, textures, salt, and dawn whistles. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under tactile action: “He trapped the sound inside the glass, sealing it…” Rhythm mirrors the music box’s halting gear. No head-hopping; girl’s interior accessed only through her gasp and laugh, legitimate external read. Diction stays within a vagrant poet’s reach—no academic register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within Lior’s lexicon—horizon mapper, moon drag, magnetic song. Rhythm escalates toward short declaratives at lift moment, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is carried by perceptual signature: “a single breath of glass,” “celestial unyoking.” Patterned repetition (“patience,” “waiting”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—smell of rust, grease-stained paternal memory, bone-deep whisper. Syntax tightens under stress: fragments like “The water would come. So would he.” Lantern’s flicker as “memories entangled” is a precise, character-specific metaphor. No head-hop; diction never exceeds a transit investigator’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulation is evident in the staccato climb after long, humid sentences underground.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains priestly diction—“confession,”“absolution,”“hymnal scent”—without ever slipping into sermon. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short fragments during soldering, longer rolling cadence as rain swells. Perceptual signature is ritual-tactile, privileging metal, light, and lavender over visual spectacle. No filter-verb stacks; each verb is strong, kinetic, and specific to workshop or ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is brass-acid-canvas; diction stays within tinker-scavenger lexicon (“half-chewed schematics,” “stolen bicycle chains”). Rhythmic control: long breathless sentences under dive, staccato fragments at lift-off. No head-hop; kaleidoscope reads as Pip-filtered prophecy. Compression (“she wasn’t falling. She was *conducting*”) taught by prior mechanical hum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is noir-cyber laced with grief: “ghost-light of a trillion forgotten posts” is perceptual, not ornamental. Compression is taught early (“data graves”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; hologram dialogue is filtered through patch vibration, keeping POV clean. Distinct rhythmic signature in fragment cadence: “She smiled. For the first time…” mirrors heartbeat sync. All figurative choices constrained to POV’s tech lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is crystalline, Arctic-elliptical: syntax thins like ice under pressure (“She didn’t flinch. She listened.”). Perceptual signature—lace pattern, groan frequencies, salt scent—never leaks into committee lyric. Compression taught early: “silence…pressed against eardrums” signals lyric mode and is paid off in final auditory focus. Register stays within fisher-volunteer diction; no thesaurus drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close voice carries Lior’s soil-centric lexicon ("slow sighs," "tendril"), rhythmic long sentences that breathe like vineyard time, tightening only at letter snap. No dialogue to distort; internal syntax stays within plausible vineyard steward register. Charcoal sketch sequence shows perceptual signature: he thinks in shapes and shadows, not words. One minor register drift—"conceptual repricing" notion feels academic against pastoral texture—drops 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: every noun is chosen for tactile resonance (“silk walls rippled though no wind stirred”). Syntax lengthens and compresses with the parapet’s pulse, creating a rhythmic thrum that mirrors the kinetics. Free indirect style is immaculate; no filter-verb stacks. The single line of dialogue is voice-appropriate—terse, desert-dry—and carries subtext about time, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric floats close to sensorium, never violating POV modesty. Diction is controlled, rhythmic—“boots barely disturbing the purple haze” sets breath-pattern that pulses to the soft shutter echo. No filter-verb stacking; perception stays concrete and selective. Voice modulation under calm pressure is exemplary; sentence length inhales/exhales with the field’s sway.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—sound-bent metaphors, lexicon of lexicography—remains Elias-bound. Rhythm accelerates with short, breath-like sentences during crystal kiss. No head-hop; woman’s voice distinctively rough against Elias’s scholarly diction. Meets 9+ edge: texture and compression taught early, paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is salt-rusted, elliptical, with tidal rhythm taught in line 1: “fog curled…like breath on glass.” Compression (“rust-raw,” “static-taste”) stays legible. Perceptual signature is synesthetic and marine—character-specific. No filter-verb stacks; diction never exceeds Elias’s junkyard diction. Final sentence relinquishes lyricism in parallel with character, proving modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-technical, calibrated to a man who sees the world through fracture lines: “silvered domes catching the light of a dying star.” Syntax mirrors pulse-motion—long breathy sentences build to staccato release. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent: Elias hears leaves that don’t exist, feels idea-hum in metal. Compression is taught early (“cracks as though reading fate”) and paid off in the open-shutter mind’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions, diction (“quiet deliberation,” “fevered brow”) consistent with an observatory bred academic. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures into staccato fragments when gears lurch, mirroring her pulse. Automaton’s voice of “grinding stones” is cleanly differentiated. One minor filter-verb cluster—“she knew,” “she’d spent,” “she’d found”—in the reflective block slightly dulls immediacy, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final contraction of time inside the library.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntax flexes under pressure—“the garden sighed around her” compresses personification without overwriting. Diction stays within Liora’s plausible lexicon (medical, rural, skeptical). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Perceptual signature is specific: she evaluates joints, notices blood color, smells iron. Rhythm accelerates at the forehead-press memory dump, then exhales into short declaratives for the return—cadence mirrors emotional arc. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-laden: “You’re late” carries entire rewritten history.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Liora’s perceptual filter: temperature of glass, taste of salt mist, auditory memory of Elias’s scoff. Syntax lengthens and softens under grief, then tightens at the transfer (“Then you’ll have to learn stillness first”). No head-hopping; the girl’s tremor is seen from outside, as Liora would. The rhythmic control of repetition (“mist…mist”; “light…light”) teaches the lyric pattern early and pays off in the final exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Lena’s perceptual bias—drip rhythm, moss scent, pendant warmth. Compression taught early (“cathedral of moss”) and maintained; no template cadence. Dialogue minimal, natural—“What do I do with it?” carries subtext of consent to vulnerability. Voice modulation under pressure: shorter, breath-cut sentences at pendant hand-off.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: spiral edges, damp pages, mist coils. Syntax lengthens then fragments as the torrent of new words arrives, mirroring the surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person omniscient stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—brass gears, leaf-gold, cracked note. Rhythm accelerates with shorter units during song-release, mirroring pulse. Diction stays within village tinkerer lexicon; no register drift. Automaton’s chirp functions as indirection—question, not exposition. No head-hopping; camera never leaves her shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to her perceptual filter: cold cracks, gold leaf “stubborn as hope,” syntax lengthens during ritual then shortens at the seal (“For a breath, nothing happened.”). No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within her alchemical idiom without drifting into textbook diction. Rhythmic control is evident in the breath-cadenced paragraphing that mirrors the windless crater.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is strong: locksmith thinks in clicks, catches reflections “pressed into glass,” counts gear teeth as language. Rhythm modulates from meditative long sentences to clipped fragments under pressure (“It worked.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Compression at the end mirrors heartbeat catch-up. Register stays within plausible self-taught artisan diction. Purposeful elision—how jars fermented—taught early and accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-limited lyric voice owns a fractal poet’s perceptual signature: “spiral grooves,” “kelp-thick grief,” “moth-wing fear.” Syntax stretches and contracts with the whalebone cadence; compression is taught early (“shingled hush”) and paid off in the final sigh. No head-hopping, no register drift. Dialogue is absent by design; the silence is the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Free-indirect style is clean and consistent: “she called it the cost of standing too close to wild things” stays within the widow’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for carving, short beats for the kettle’s whistle—mirroring emotional intensity. Figurative language is sparse, never purple: “light fractured like old glass” is the single simile and it earns its place. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (“calloused palms,” “second skin” of sawdust) is character-bound and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught (“wind that never ceased,” “lagoon remembered”) and modulates under pressure—short, breathless clauses at the jump. Perceptual signature is Lira’s: she reads surfaces, counts frames, smells ozone. No head-hopping; ghost dialogue is externalized memory, not independent interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Lena’s perceptual filter—notations of angles, pressure, metal fatigue—syntax tightening into stub clauses as pressure peaks (“She calculated.”). Carnival-to-terminal diction avoids lyric purple, stays within engineer lexicon; metaphor is engineered (“circuit board,” “redirection”) not ornamental. No head-hop; foreman’s single line is reported speech, not interior access. Rhythm scales with tempo—long opening sentence breathes atmosphere, later fragments mirror maze turns—demonstrating deliberate voice control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to the scribe’s perceptual filter: he hears “fractured whispers” as voices until forced to recognize them as his own gears. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic excruciating gentleness, then fractures into short ticks: “tick-tick-ticked.” No head-hop; elders remain shadowy, as they do in his mind. Diction stays within plausible artisan-scribe lexicon—orrery, petrichor, chime—never drifts to academic meta-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—metallic light, salvage-trained appraisals—remains character-specific. Prose rhythm modulates: long clause for twilight glide, staccato for radio shard. No head-hop; knowledge bounded to Liora. Filter verbs minimal and earned (“she felt like”). Voice grows slightly lyric under mist but stays anchored in bodily action; no committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is collector-specific—“stories knotted into husks,” “braided ledger of tides”—and syntax elongates under reverence, then shortens during the splice. Diction stays inside coastal vernacular: “hitch,” “splice,” “shepherd’s bend.” No dialogue to judge; interior voice sustains distinct texture. Only micro-slip: “infinitely patient” twice; otherwise rhythm modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is compressed, lyric, oceanic—syntax swells and ebbs like tide. Perceptual signature sharp: Elias notices unravelled weft before garden’s beauty, catalogues silence as “weight of things unsaid.” Rhythm escalates toward short declaratives at closure (“He would listen. He would write.”) without breaking pattern. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; free-indirect glides seamlessly into poetic assertion without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited remains locked to Aldric’s perceptual signature—selective attention to sound of chains, taste of rust, visual fracture of light. Syntax lengthens under awe (“the bitter-sweet tang of rot and renewal”), shortens under action (“The palace shuddered”). No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Free-indirect “he called it hypothesizing” slips seamlessly into diction plausible for a prince-scientist. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter: “kelp-drift peace,” “rough and crackling like dry kindling.” Syntax mirrors pulse—long lyric coils calm, then fragment when the cry cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric yet grounded: “luminous skeptic,” “sidereal patience” remain inside Liora’s lexicon of someone who mistrusts glow. Syntax modulates—long coils for alleys, abrupt fragments under pressure (“She didn’t wait”). Filter verbs minimal; perception biased toward light, texture, sound. No dialogue, therefore no voice-convergence risk; internal texture stays singular and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: long vowel cadences mimic the slow exhalation of gas petals, while brass-and-frequency diction keeps the diction otherworldly yet precise. Perceptual signature is strong—Veyra notices “the same frequency as her heartbeat,” a synesthetic bias that recurs when the gear thrums through bone. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs (“she thought,” “she realized”) are absent; instead, perception is rendered as immediate sensory fact, keeping psychic distance shallow and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to the carver’s sensory filter: “his fingers… twitched,” “he retraced… Liora.” Perceptual signature—stone dust as breath, butterflies as stained glass—remains consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, staccato for cracked-granite beat. No dialogue beyond the father’s spectral lines; those lines carry subtext of mentorship rather than exposition. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains salt-iron perceptual signature throughout. Rhythm modulates with pendulum breath—long sentences for arc, fragments at pause (“Not forgiven. Acknowledged.”). No head-hopping; village’s interiority implied solely through Elias’s projected gaze. Diction stays within a winder’s lexicon: gearwork, chime, oil, rake-handle—no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter: soil temperature, plant gossip, knot “breathing.” Syntax mirrors his gardener patience—long sentences for untangling, fragment shards at each knot-pop. No head-hop; widow appears only as vision. Diction stays within rural, plant-based lexicon; “lamb’s ear,” “marigold,” “weaving” read as natural thought-words. Rhythm accelerates subtly as lantern flame blurs blue, then exhales into the final reset.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is distinct: compressed lyric syntax, patterned elision (“a vibration like a held breath”), and perceptual signature of a cartographer who notices fissures and shadows. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds. Diction stays within Liora’s lexicon—ledger, nib, comet ink—never drifting into academic gloss. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during the mapping rush, then exhales into the final long sentence of departure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—music metaphors, copyist diction (“final measures,” “quill”). Rhythm compresses under knock: short clauses mimic pulse. Voice modulation clear: lyrical openings tighten to staccato beats at intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, rhythmically controlled—“You keep breaking things / No, I reveal what they already were.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices light catches, draft timing, shard refractions—artist’s eye filtered through fatalism. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Elision (“the chair stopped”) is taught early and paid off at closure; non-standard fragmentation (“thread by thread, through what you left unsaid”) is legible and motive-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s diction—“sanitized ledgers,” “rat who’d read too many books”—creating a perceptual signature of educated bitterness. Rhythm accelerates into staccato fragments as water rises (“He didn’t shout. He didn’t beg.”), mirroring pulse without losing clarity. No filter-verb stack; metaphors stay salt-logged and mechanical, true to vocational scavenger. Dialogue sparse, abrasive, and status-laden; Veyra’s too-clean boots speak louder than accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature—“expectantly resigned sigh,” “slow fire” of stained glass—syntax mirrors musical phrasing. No head-hopping; choral voices remain external, heard, not interiorized. Compression is purposeful: paragraph lengths modulate like breaths, longest where silence is taught. Register remains within Elias’s professional lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains chef-perceptor diction: “taste of memories,” “dough,” “prune,” “plating.” Rhythm accelerates at fruit-slice via parataxis, then exhales into quiet last line. No head-hop; POV modesty intact—he never knows elders’ next move. Metaphors culinary-consistent, never strained. Dialogue absent by design; voice still carries subtext through interiority. Final “quiet / sweet” couplet crystallizes cadence and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—wind scent, lacquer edges, drone lights “like fireflies”—with rhythmic compression under stress. Free-indirect (“the words had itched under his skin”) is clean, no filter-verb bloat. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on syntax; occasional inversion (“raw as honey from a crushed comb”) reads purposeful and voice-consistent. No head-hop; distance stable; elision taught early (“no one crossed since the blackout”) and paid off in final crowd gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“salt-stiff ribbon,” “color of dried lavender”—is character-peculiar, not catalog. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for tide exhale, clipped fragments for voice intrusion. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Register stays within coastal, apothecary-adjacent lexicon; no academic drift. Free indirect blends cleanly: “She didn’t mean to sanctify…” carries Liora’s self-mocking tone inside narration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s telepathic voice—compressed, riddling, tide-like—never slips into exposition dump; syntax omits verbs to feel carved. Intruder’s signed reply is brittle, monosyllabic, contrasting stone-chorus. Psychic distance cleanly controlled: we stay inside the intruder’s sensorium until the final breath-sea merger. No head-hopping; POV collapse into oceanic “we” at end is earned and sign-posted.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice carries mathematician’s perceptual signature: recursive, proof-driven, yet sensorially grounded (“metronome for her thoughts”). Syntax tightens under pressure—single-word sentences (“She ran. Not upward, but sideways…”)—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so register remains stable; internal lexicon stays within plausible academic-math frame.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close keeps painter-vision steady: synesthetic color perception, insomnia-dilated time sense, and a diction tuned to pigment and moonlight. Filter verbs are sparse; perceptual signature is vivid (“calligrapher’s moon-tipped brush,” “waxing moon slip through the haze like a coin”) without purple bloat. No head-hopping; the calligrapher and child appear only as sensory ghosts, maintaining POV modesty. Rhythm modulates from long hypnotic sentences to the staccato final “The greenhouse held its breath. Somewhere, a window opened.”—a controlled breath-mimic that matches content.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Curator-perceptual signature steady: synaesthetic slide of emerald into taste, precise lexicon of ovens and archives. Rhythm modulates—long, mist-laden cadences in grotto, staccato runs as Liora sprints. No head-hop; free-indirect stays inside Liora’s sensory filter. Dialogue minimal, idiomatic, class-true (“tombstones”), no convergence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter: “brass innards rusted into silence” is a horologist’s metaphor, not a narrator’s flourish. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis as the spiral tightens—“Light bled… bruised violet… cold fire”—then fractures into single-word beats: “Still falling. Still initiate.” No head-hopping; the one-line glimpse of mainland clocks is still filtered through his anticipated absence. Voice is irreplaceable: only a counter-clockwise craftsman would hear gears “sing like a thousand clocks unwinding.”

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is baroque-horror: “silvered surfaces warping the dark like a lung”—yet diction stays within a perceptive undead showman. Rhythm accelerates into staccato during the lunge, then exhales with the mirrors’ silver tears. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“You’re armed with a whisper”).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is synesthetic, tidal, musically compressed: “clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music,” “sound bloomed like a bruise.” Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure, then widens into rolling thunder laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Scholarly perceptual signature is precise—“gloved fingers,” “vellum pages brittle but unbroken,” sound of “ghost engineer.” Syntax tightens under pressure: short, unadorned sentences when torch approaches; longer, clause-heavy cadence for reflection. No dialogue needed; third-person close stays within Elias’s sensory envelope. Filter verbs rare; diction remains inside humanities academic register. Final rhythmic lift as he steps “into the dark” gives satisfying stanza-like close.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—surveyor’s measurements, ink hue of dried violets, the ache of cracks. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for submerged reverie, staccato when the carp shadow intrudes. No head-hopping; diction remains within his lexicon. Voice-specific metaphor (“iron teeth locking the past”) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual filter: salt-thick air narrows to ledger edges, wheel-rust grates in teeth, light rakes like fingers. Sentence rhythm mirrors his calm—long inhalations of clauses that suddenly contract when the insignia is recognized. No head-hop; knowledge stays bounded—he infers but never knows who scripted him.

No head-hopping; focalization remains strictly Lira’s, even in shared action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)

Prose rhythm modulates under pressure—short, jagged phrases during laughter; flowing cadences during playing. Free indirect thought merges seamlessly with action (“He was running out of time—literally”). No head-hopping; even grandmother’s voice is filtered through cello-warble, not omniscient narration.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices wind chime patterns, salt foam, and the texture of doubt. Syntax modulates under pressure—short clauses during unraveling (“Gone.”), flowing cadence in reflection—without losing coherence. Free indirect style merges Elias’s thought and narration seamlessly (“He wasn’t afraid of shadows…”). No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored even when the woman appears, her dialogue distinct (“I’m here to help you carry yours”) yet integrated into his focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.5)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices magnetic hums, bone-weightlessness, and petal-like year-peeling because his body is literally unspooling. Syntax modulates with trance depth—longer sentences during regression (“He was twenty again…”) fracture into staccato beats at climax (“One ripple. Two. Three”). No head-hopping; even memories are filtered through present sensory triggers (crushed sage → orchard plums). Voice remains consistent in elevated diction (“stubborn precision,” “sycamore hush”) because it mirrors Elias’s scholarly solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is inseparable from perception: syntax mirrors vibration (“ripples in still water”), diction favors tactile precision (“worn smooth by generations of palms”), and rhythm slows or sharpens with pressure. POV remains rigorously single, with no leakage; all knowledge is filtered through resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s synesthetic perception (“cobalt despair, amber longing”). Voice modulates rhythmically—from metronomic opening to breathless discovery to hushed release—with syntax compressing under pressure (“He waded… ducked… smelled”).

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    Voice is singularly percussive and bone-dry, with rhythmic control that accelerates during crystallization (“The fears crystallized first… forming a coiled, barnacled rope”) then breathes in Charged Poise (“The stars blinked down… indifferent”).
