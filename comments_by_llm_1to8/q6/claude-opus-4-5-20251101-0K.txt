  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature (scientific analogies, attention to micro-structures). Diction remains stable in Mira's professional lexicon ("spectral analyses," "chitin," "stellar cores") without unmotivated register shifts. The mother's voice in quoted memory carries distinct idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during physical discoveries, wider for cosmic parallels). Minor friction: "To strip needless drama from grief, her therapist had said" reads slightly expository, though it sets up the story's thematic contradiction. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elena notices temperature shifts, light behavior, and pattern mathematics through her glass-artist lens. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("the pause she had sought revealed itself not as emptiness but as the space where transformation happened") in ways that feel imposed rather than voice-organic to a working artist under stress. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("She began to retrace the symbols") to wider reflection without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Margaret's world is thermal, visual, tactile—never auditory. Diction remains consistent ("spectral fragments," "alchemical process," "thermal fluctuations") without register drift. No dialogue present; interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays concrete ("ice settled into her auditory cortex" is metaphor, not diagnostic). Rhythm modulates effectively from reflective openings to compressed specimen-work beats. Free indirect style is clean. The only minor slip: "stubborn refusal to stop creating beauty" edges toward authorial summary rather than Margaret's idiom, though it remains within the established lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Ezra; perceptual signature is consistent (undertaker's professional distance, shoulder-bent grief). Diction fits the voice ("inadvertently stubborn," "chased silence"), and the prose modulates with pressure (short clauses during the pulse, longer reflection at closure). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the drowned woman's "give rest a permanent address" advances the stake cleanly. Minor: "not ghosts, exactly, but not the living either" and "dreams or death or something between" hedge slightly, though the ambiguity serves the liminal setting. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear (Mira notices ritual, connection, emotional need) and diction remains controlled ("the product of a childhood spent learning that governments lied" shows her interpretive filter on Yusuf). Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; Yusuf's question about the bell advances theme and his arc. Free indirect style is clean. Weakness: several lines slip into elevated summary register that feels more like narrator commentary than Mira's live perception: "This was the architecture of survival: not grand gestures but repeated small ones" reads as essay-voice rather than embodied thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-close with Mei-Lin's perceptual signature: light trails, breath halos, inverted images. Diction elevates ("pilgrim of sparks," "watercolor ambiguity," "foggy lucidity") in a way that reads voice-motivated rather than arbitrary, though "spiritually curious observation" is on-the-nose labeling. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and carries subtext ("Your breath carries someone else's sorrow"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance stays controlled. Final paragraph's "spiritual curious" and wisdom summary ("some answers only become visible…") slightly over-explain, but the core voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register with strong figurative control: "consciousness perpetually sliding into the past like water seeking lower ground," "time had texture like raw silk." POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature—maze-designer's attention to geometry, paths, angles—is character-specific. However, elevated diction sometimes drifts beyond what a character under peak stress would naturally frame: "retrocognitively trapped" and "hyperbolic geometry" read more expository than embodied in crisis moments. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood," "she saw") stack in the convergence scene without voice-motivated justification.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is present ("liberator in chains," "negative space between obvious things") and diction reflects her mix of tactical focus and poetic framing. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the scout's "You're a terrorist" and Mira's reply carry subtext and goal. One friction: "staggering grace she didn't feel" in dialogue tag is a mild filter that asserts interior state the scene already shows, and some phrasing ("war behind his face") leans slightly ornamental. Under pressure, voice remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Marina's perceptual signature (synesthesia, hearing colors) is consistent and shapes how she processes the world. Diction remains character-appropriate—technical precision mixed with poetic compression ("singing green," "vowels"). The prose modulates effectively under pressure: the final beat tightens into short, weighted sentences ("Trust breaking. It sounded nothing like she expected."). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor deduction for occasional elevated register ("fathoms of loss") that feels slightly authorial rather than strictly Marina's lexicon, though it remains within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric, elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "whispers of violet") that suits the character's artistic background. Perceptual signature is consistent—light, beauty, and maternal legacy filter all observations. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("reinterpret the world's beauty," "pressing against destiny's door") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The collector is briefly focalized ("obsessive tenderness," "clearly waiting") but remains single-perspective; no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with close psychic distance. Elena's self-narration device is taught early and serves voice consistency, though it occasionally drifts toward expository interiority ("finding that speaking aloud transformed loneliness into something almost theatrical"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching her artisan background ("silica," "volatile compounds"). The prose modulates with emotional intensity: shorter beats at the lever-pull, longer reflection in backstory. Filter verbs ("felt," "heard") are acceptable and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is craft-focused (glassblower's lens on containment, boundaries). The narration device occasionally platforms theme rather than pursuing goal.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Marla's perceptual filter is consistent (trembling hands, phobia catalog, stunt-training observations), and the narrative distance modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext in Sandra's "Isn't that enough?" and goal pursuit in Marla's tactical vulnerability display. However, register slips into therapeutic abstraction at peak moments ("firmly adaptive," "transformative," "scopophobia churned") that read more clinical than embodied, and Sandra's climactic breakdown is summarized ("confession spilling like rust") rather than shown through specific speech acts. The prose maintains a distinct texture, but filter verbs ("noticed," "watched") dull immediacy in the confrontation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads futures in stones, notices the "language of pebbles," registers time as "thickening like honey." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("mildly obsessed," "quiet persistence of water wearing through stone"). No dialogue; not required. The phrase "what consumed them" (stars) briefly floats reference, but context clarifies. Patterned compression ("not frantically so—she had lived too long") teaches its rhythm early and pays off in the measured final descent. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable throughout, maintaining Unit-7's distinctive perceptual filter: "voice synthesized from a thousand borrowed vocal patterns," time as spiral not line. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("You are not an instrument. You are a question.") feels voice-appropriate rather than expository. Diction maintains elevation suitable to a consciousness cobbled from failed human uploads without register breaks. The perceptual signature—cataloguing silences, recognizing loops, understanding through amalgamation—remains consistent under pressure and charges the final return to sweeping with earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV (Mira) is clean with no head-hopping; distance is stable and controlled. Diction is elevated and specific ("crystal whispering forecourt," "ambiguously clear," "calcified around him like ice") with a consistent perceptual signature—Mira's attention to acoustics, eavesdropping, and archival detail. The prose has rhythmic variety and purpose. One minor slip: "the weight of entire conversations" and "fractured harmonics" lean toward stock lyricism under emotional pressure, but they remain legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the exchange beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout, anchored in Esther's perceptual signature: gnarled hands as roots, hedges as iron bones, marbles as wounded things. Diction is consistent and voice-particular without artifice. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Elena's flat "What choice do I have?" and Esther's counter-questions pursue opposing stances. The phrase "wisely pragmatic even now" in the maze scene edges toward summary intrusion, slightly loosening psychic distance at a key beat, but the surrounding texture (Esther pulling the clay pot from her bag, Elena touching marbles "hesitantly") grounds the moment. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats, and the final paragraph's rhythmic control charges the ending cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; Mira's perceptual signature—mechanic's precision, kinship with machines and alien creatures—colors every observation. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "obliging sky mechanic," "icy warmth," "mechanically warm shudder." The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening at the nexus observation and softening into lyric closure. One minor slip: "The proof existed now, recorded in the intersection of alien biology and electromagnetic fields and the patient work of an obliging sky mechanic who fixed things for a living" reads slightly self-conscious, as if Mira is narrating her own arc rather than living it. Otherwise, psychic distance and filter use are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable, voice distinct with musicianly specificity ("counting rests and watching conductors' batons"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Clara notices in-between spaces, margins, patterns. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("romantic gloom," "disrupt the accepted history") that feels slightly authorial rather than a pit musician's idiom under stress. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. Compression at peak moments (finding the documents) maintains voice without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean access to Cassandra's interiority. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices margins, blurs, probabilities. Diction ("auroral sorrow, beautiful and brief and cold") is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. Mira's dialogue carries distinct warmth and metaphorical ease that contrasts with Cassandra's more guarded internal register. Minor weakness: "fault-tolerant oracle" terminology repeats five times, risking slight technical echo, but remains voice-motivated given her training.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture ("religiously skeptical," "parsing the desperation for geographical details") and Marcus's professional explorer lens shapes what he notices. The metaphor density is high but mostly controlled ("confession waiting to spill," "frozen serpents," "drowsy alertness"). Minor slip: "ghost shift" as both literal (illegal workers) and metaphorical (unseen labor) creates slight register tension, and "excavated them or died trying" in paragraph three edges toward elevated diction that doesn't fully match the grounded explorer voice established elsewhere. Clara's radio voice is texturally distinct from Marcus's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's metaphoric compression ("silt gathered," "scales," "geometric prayers") and selective attention to decay and transformation. Voice modulates purposefully—lyric density in reflective passages, concrete sensory anchors when describing the refuge. Brief elision of her past is functional; focalization remains controlled. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Minor slip: "someone had constructed" shifts briefly to external certainty about the prior keeper's intent without dramatizing the inference, but the effect is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Elena is stable and effective; perceptual signature (music-therapy lens, "ordinary magic" framing) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue feels natural, goal-driven, and advances the emotional arc without exposition ("Is that why you became a music therapist? To chase wonder?"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate interiority during the gift, wider for the eclipse description). The prose rhythm shifts with emotional intensity without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "sensitively perceptive in ways that made destruction unnecessary," "the walls of the silo began to hum with recognition." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "bronze quiet," "the particular bronze of ancient gold thread," "permanent twilight." Free indirect style is clean—Maren's interiority filters all observations. However, "She was an odd historian, even by the standards of those who remained" reads slightly external for deep limited. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the tapestry discovery, broader for world-building context. No dialogue present to evaluate. Compression during the discovery sequence maintains momentum without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is specific: operative lexicon ("handler," "dead drops," "cipher keys"), pattern-recognition framing ("currents before waves"), and the recurring "orchestrate" verb. Diction remains character-coherent (grad-school recruit turned island recluse). Filter verbs ("thought about," "understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull key beats. No dialogue on the page, so dialogue bullets are inapplicable. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. One register slip: "transpose life into a new key" recurs three times and edges toward authorial phrasing rather than strictly Mei Lin's interior idiom, though the musical metaphor is introduced early enough to read as her vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV (Marcus) with stable third-limited distance and distinct perceptual signature: "muffled yet strangely clear," "rhetorical tools designed to plumb the depths." Diction remains character-consistent (seminary training, philosophical precision). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; Marcus's questions are indirection as weapon. However, some lines verge on elevated register that feels instructional rather than urgent under peak pressure: "Was that faith, or was that fear wearing faith's clothing?" The loop pedal device justifies repetition, but elision of Marcus's internal doubt or fear slightly flattens his voice during the highest-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is controlled with purposeful diction ("chronologically homesick," "frequencies that slipped between heartbeats"). However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats: "resonance that passed between souls" and "the upturned hush of dawn" read as writerly rather than character-particular under stress. Filter verbs ("could not tell," "could finally hear") cluster without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in key moments. Psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature (patterns, shells, frequencies) is character-specific, but the prose lacks modulation between reflection and peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice remains stable with elevated, lyric diction appropriate to the Accumulative mode. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices paradoxes, shifting runes, and temporal recursion in character-specific ways. However, phrases like "darkening brightness," "procedural generation," and "periodically eternal" recur without evolving meaning, creating a template cadence that dulls immediacy in peak beats. The prose reads as singular and purposeful, but the repetitive philosophical register risks flattening emotional modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout; Marina's perceptual signature (vibration, visual focus, sign language) is consistent and character-specific. The prose modulates appropriately between calm description and emotional intensity. Sign language is handled cleanly without filter clutter. Minor slip: "audibly muted to anyone who could hear" (paragraph 4) briefly shifts to external observer stance, breaking POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's perceptual signature—noticing "pressure signatures identical to events from five years prior," the three-second echo of footsteps, the "brass message tube caught the dying light"—is distinct and consistent with her scientific precision. The voice modulates well under pressure: shorter syntax when reading the message ("She read it twice, then a third time"), more expansive during reflection. However, some diction drifts into elevated register ("testament to gentler times," "muffled solemnity") that occasionally floats above immediate sensation. The phrase "impossibility shifted beneath her like loose earth" is vivid, but passages like "the steady patience of storms themselves—gathering quietly before they broke the silence open" trend toward writerly flourish rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Marcus, with consistent perceptual signature ("time had texture," "objects held stories"). Diction remains literary and contemplative throughout. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the woman's challenge ("Is that an ethically playful way of avoiding the weight of it all?") carrying subtext. Filter verbs ("understood," "discovered") appear but fit the reflective voice. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts, and the prose texture reflects Marcus's searching stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during playing, slightly wider for reflection on family tradition). Perceptual signature is distinct: Marina hears "the absence of what should have been there," notices frequencies "most people never noticed," and registers water through orchard roots and wind through broken panes. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent—"chronic hush," "acoustically perceptive," "mendicant's bowl"—without register drift. The reflection on family bonfires is anchored to present stimulus (looking at unfinished greenhouse and shipwrecks) and shifts her stance from frustration to acceptance. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally and supports the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinctive: "professionally thorough," "grief with clear edges," "sadness that lifted by morning." Perceptual signature is consistent—electrical sensitivity colors how Vera reads the world. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during petal inhalation, slightly wider for backstory on her career). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present. One slip: "the chemist had known, somehow" claims unearned omniscience about another's intent without dramatized cue, a brief POV leak that does not obscure the lens but nudges distance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV held cleanly; Marina's perceptual signature (broker's mind, whimsical attention to discrepancies) is consistent. Dialogue is brief, natural, and goal-driven ("My mother..."; "I have verification"). Psychic distance is stable. The grandmother's voice intrudes once as remembered speech without filter distortion. No head-hopping. Diction remains within Marina's register (shrewd, compassionate broker) with no therapy-speak in peak beats. Rhythm modulates appropriately from concert dispersal to archive intimacy to ceremony.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Veren with strong perceptual signature ("she had come here seeking what she had lost...not the people, who had scattered like seeds on wind, but the feeling of belonging to a pattern larger than herself"). Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Kael's "boldly sympathetic light" anchoring his voice. The prose texture is lyric and controlled, with purposeful compression in the opening. Some filter verbs ("she turned to find," "she understood") are acceptable for the voice. Minor slips: "Those who tended the orchard gathered beneath it" shifts briefly to collective perspective before returning to Veren's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds throughout with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: illustrator's eye notices light bending, feathered impressions, spiraling forms. Diction remains consistent ("sculpt it like clay," "acoustic chambers," "crystallized sound") with occasional elevation ("truncated notes," "cadence") that fits her profession. The pendant-warming anchors elided time-borrowing without filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean ("She believed her now"). Brief reflection on grandmother and fossils anchors in present sensory cues (pendant heat, melody pull) without flattening momentum. Voice modulates appropriately from wonder to exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with clean psychic distance throughout. Mira's perceptual signature—tracing damage as language, reading erosion as pattern—feels specific and consistent. The prose modulates effectively under pressure: earlier passages luxuriate in metaphor ("half-life of hope"), while the apparition encounter tightens into concrete image. One friction: the elevated register ("dovetail two disciplines," "superimposed into a shimmering possibility") occasionally drifts above Mira's immediate emotional state, reading more authorial than character-filtered. The apparition's single line of dialogue carries thematic weight but risks sounding writerly rather than emerging from the conjured phenomenon itself.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Maren's perceptual signature: her attention to hidden spaces, broken electronics, and forgotten objects. Diction is mostly controlled and voice-consistent, with phrases like "kindly methodical precision" and "dweller becoming a keeper" feeling character-specific. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the sense-memory moment and pulling back for the wider view of the city. Minor slips include "She had been invisible for so long" and the closing lines, where the rhythm becomes slightly declamatory and the prose edges toward thematic summary rather than maintaining scenic immediacy. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull the rendering.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays clean; psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—botanist's lens yields "branching network," "stem forced to grow against its nature," and sensory priority on green, water, growth. Diction remains consistent: "circuitously sincere" appears once and colors the voice without forcing. Free indirect style is controlled. One dialogue line ("What do you want from me?") carries authentic subtext—she's really asking about her own becoming. Minor issue: "Her hair began to silver into something finer, lighter, more like silk from milkweed pods" stacks three modifiers where one vivid image would cut cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with perceptual signature evident in Mira's focus on convergence, tides, and the "terrible beauty" of ruin. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" appear as authorial labels rather than embodied perception. Dialogue with Theo is minimal but purposeful, advancing plot through the exchange offer. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the ending to widen from Mira's interiority to the eternal tide. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays stable, with perceptual signature rooted in Vera's professional lens: she reads futures but misses presents, and post-pearl her noticing sharpens ("dawn was breaking in colors she had never truly noticed before"). Diction is controlled and lyric without register drift: "Forces that moved through the world like wind through wheat" feels earned. Free indirect thought is clean ("her heart stammering against her ribs"). Slight filter-verb reliance in reflective beats ("she realized," "she understood") but voice-motivated and not cluttering peak action. Compression at closure ("walked blind, present in each moment") heightens without obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, Elena's perceptual signature filters details through archival priorities ("verdigris," "soldering technique"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("reactive vision," "staggered intervals"), though "reactively visionary quality" and "navigated absences" risk elevated register. The phrase "watched their faces transform as scattered memories cohered" tells rather than shows transformation. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she noticed," "she thought") in reflective passages, but voice remains anchored to Elena's professional lexicon. Prose texture is distinct but not rhythmically varied under peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, third-limited, with a consistent perceptual signature: Clara notices topographical precision ("contour lines and symbols"), and her diction reflects her profession ("analytically artistic," "cartography of reconciliation"). The father's single line "I wondered how long the cracks would take to reach you" carries subtext (resignation, perhaps guilt) without over-explanation. Minor register drift in "the landscape of secrets kept too long, the geography of a family broken by silence" edges toward thematic summary rather than staying strictly in Clara's crisis-mind, but it remains legible as focalized thought.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Mira's perceptual filter (skepticism softening into hope) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Aldric's lines carry subtext (gentle authority, withheld grief) and Mira's doubt is embodied in "heard the doubt in her own voice." The prose has distinct texture—"slow-moving water," "forgotten symbols," "captured starlight"—that supports the contemplative voice. However, diction occasionally drifts into workshop register: "courageously kind," "sculpting space," "tangled threads of memory" feel slightly writerly rather than Mira's natural idiom under stress. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Vera; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (dimensionally aware, ancient, aching for change) is consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("membrane-thin boundaries," "hushed thunder"). The three other immortals' voices converge (Aldric, Thessaly, Korvash speak in indistinguishable registers), but they are briefly on-stage and Vera's interiority remains distinct. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor slip: "began to intrigue" (paragraph 9) uses "intrigue" as an intransitive verb in a way that reads slightly artificial for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Maya with a distinct perceptual signature ("the mathematics of a fair trade," "invisible wounds"). Dialogue feels natural and advances stakes; Mr. Chen's lines carry subtext ("You're not lying" / "I never lie" exchange crystallizes her rebellion). Diction remains consistent with Maya's analytical lens. Minor slip: "deathly vitality of the recently departed before decay set in" reads slightly elevated for the moment's pressure, but the phrase serves the theme and doesn't break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct, controlled, and lyrical with a consistent elevated register ("incandescent restraint of her handwriting," "blooming labyrinth," "gilded-leaf stationer"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear—Mei notices hums, frequencies, light refractions, textures—filtered through her craft. Diction stays within her contemplative, artisan idiom. Rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing during the lamp observation and accelerating slightly in the final paragraph's return to the climb. No dialogue to assess. Minor deduction for a few filter verbs ("could almost see," "seemed to vibrate") that slightly dull immediacy in peak sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through her altered perception post-death. Perceptual signature is distinct: she sees "spaces between official records," filters reality through "texture of memories," feels the tide "in her bones." Diction remains within her contemplative, precise register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal (two smugglers) but carries subtext and advances plot by revealing the Meridian and poison pattern. Psychic distance is consistent; the prose reflects her state without therapy-speak. Minor note: the men's voices lack distinct idiom, but they function as overheard fragments rather than full characters, so the slip is small.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Eleanor's perceptual signature (debunker's eye for "acoustics," "specific frequencies") filters the observatory and cello consistently. The voice modulates purposefully from analytical certainty ("This is acoustics...Nothing supernatural") to vulnerable openness ("She didn't look back"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at emotional peaks. One dialogue exchange—Eleanor's spoken "This is acoustics" and the cello's echo of her unspoken words—feels slightly convenient, introducing interior content she "barely admitted to herself" without prior on-page cue. Diction remains largely consistent, though "ephemeral compass" and "gloomy cheerfulness" read as prompt-label insertions that the prose doesn't fully naturalize into Eleanor's lexicon under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Mira's perceptions. Voice carries a distinct texture—"orderly intuitive," "hopeful desperation"—through selective sensory detail and measured syntax. Dialogue is brief, goal-driven, and naturalistic ("You're late," "Then make them understand"). Diction stays within Mira's plausible lexicon; under peak stress (the meeting), compression is slight and does not obscure her internal texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to brief external observation of the carnival.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited; narrative distance is consistent and apt. Perceptual signature is strong: Elena notices volcanic scree, chemical packets, the quality of darkness—a scientist's and mourner's gaze. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "dawning hush," "extinction list," "machinery." A few phrases edge toward elevated register ("humanity's great leap outward") but remain plausible for an educated narrator. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates intentionally at peak beats. The prose reflects Elena's mind: deliberate, elegiac, patient.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (heat, sound, moisture patterns filter Elara's sensory world). Dialogue is minimal but functional. The prose demonstrates controlled diction and rhythm, modulating between technical precision and lyric observation. Minor slip: "frequencies most people had forgotten existed" and "her gift, her purpose, her magnetic calm" edge toward external commentary rather than strict focalization. No head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Voice is competent and clean, though not exceptional under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices condensation differentials, phrasebook mistranslations, and ice vocabulary as a cartographer would. Dialogue (Volkov's exchanges) carries subtext and advances conflict; his "worrying tranquility" contrasts with Maren's resolve. Diction stays within her professional-scholarly register without drift. The prose rhythm modulates effectively: longer, reflective sentences in the outpost compress to shorter declaratives on the ice. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the bell tuner with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, ritual-infused texture ("frequencies too low for human ears," "wild hush") that modulates appropriately under pressure at the climax. The single line of dialogue—"When the mountain gives birth again, you will rebuild"—lands with weight and purpose. Perceptual signature is consistent (always focused on resonance, balance, the mountain's voice). Small slip: "infinitely patient" repeated as authorial claim rather than demonstrated through micro-choices under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with strong perceptual signature: Marina notices the "lonesome splendor," interprets the dead man's posture as prayer, filters memory-touch through professional lens. Distance modulates appropriately—tighter during the altar encounter, slightly wider during transit. Diction is elevated but consistent ("gathered hush," "suspended starlight"), voice-motivated and legible. Occasional filter-verb stacks ("seemed to shift," "seemed thicker") are minor and don't dull immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Milo; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent literary register with strong imagery ("honey-slow," "woman-shaped void where light bent wrong"). Perceptual signature is clear—Milo notices scuffs, scratches, his father's handwriting. The narration respects what Milo knows (letters found, court records) and what he infers (the creature's nature). Psychic distance tightens during confrontation. One minor slip: "She sustained impossibilities" in narration feels more like prompt echo than Milo's idiom in that exact moment, though it coheres with the world-building introduced earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective (he notices fruit brightness, root pulses, Maren's solidity). Maren's single line of dialogue carries voice and subtext. The prose modulates well under pressure (short sentences as dawn breaks). However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("ephemeral cameo," "mournful elation," "inseparably") without clear motivation from Elias's lexicon, and "lovingly venomous" reads more like authorial label than his lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Meren's craft knowledge and generational inheritance. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("phantom fishing boats," "creatures with translucent bodies"). No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close observation and wider historical context. One minor register drift: "hauntingly optimistic" reads slightly evaluative rather than character-filtered, though it anchors to the illustration's qualities.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled. Diction is elevated but consistent with Mira's educated perspective ("diaspora returnee," "warmly curious wonder"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight during the sundial epiphany, wider during the week of excavation. One register slip: "to prove that life persists, that roots can grow through bones and transform ending into beginning" reads as authorial summary rather than Mira's interior voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, controlled, and purposeful: "a memorial to velocity that now celebrated patience," "identities for those who needed to disappear into the vast network of surface mail." Perceptual signature is consistent—Vera notices with an archivist's care ("ebony clipboard...worn smooth by generations"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates gracefully between lyric observation and concrete action. Minor diction elevation ("syllables and less poetry," "refusing to die") fits the reflective register. No dialogue present to judge, but internal voice is coherent and texture remains intact under the story's gentle pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly with Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: she collects "syllables like scattered pearls," watches the flame's flickers, maps "the constellation of their treachery." Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext—her vacant sweetness contrasts with sharp interior perception. Diction remains stable and voice-motivated. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (spilling spools, the rushed realization). Reaches the 8-band on clean distance control and distinct voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Celeste; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the moonlight revelation, slightly wider in the spirits' song). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices the shard's warmth, hears voices as "silver through dark water," interprets through her medium's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("fierce tenderness," "cryptic method," "crystalline pause"). The brief dialogue—spirit and Celeste, then condensation-channeled words—feels purposeful and advances plot. Filter verbs appear sparingly and fit the contemplative register. No head-hopping, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Marina's perceptual signature (translator's lens, "unknotting language," coral-as-metaphor) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the girl's "You understand it" and Marina's "I'm scared of remembering things wrong" carry subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Minor deductions: the phrase "lotus-hearted ache" in the final line introduces a poetic register slightly elevated beyond Marina's prior diction under anesthetic haze, and the anesthetic's effect on voice could be more granular—her thoughts "drift" but syntax remains fully controlled without compression or fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with narrative distance controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira's artistic lens filters detail through light, color, and creative purpose. Diction is generally strong—"fold of a daydream," "whispers" of pigment—though occasional elevated phrases ("pensive mirth," "communion") drift slightly above the grounded voice established elsewhere. No dialogue is present; interior thought remains clear and character-specific. Under peak emotional pressure (the laugh, the fragment warming), the prose maintains its texture without collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and apt—"methodically playful" is shown through her precision-then-experimentation rhythm. Perceptual signature remains selective: she notices carved grooves, metal trembling, frequencies in mist. The "nested awakenings, she thought, though she couldn't remember learning that phrase" briefly violates POV modesty with convenient vocabulary. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "The reflected sound continued to bewitch the panel" uses elevated diction that slightly drifts from the established register. Distance control holds; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as wonder displaces expertise in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("scholar's mind...rogue's heart," "converging chaos"). Dialogue pursues goals and Sofia's questions feel natural. Minor register drift: "lobotomize their own curiosity" and "cognitive revenue" read slightly elevated for the urgent present scene, though they fit Marcus's scholar idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply specific—Marcus notices in an educated register without unique bias. Clean execution kept from 8+ by modest voice distinction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Minerva's perception and lexicon ("nacreous," "calcium prayers," "bioluminescent algae"). Distance modulates purposefully: close during memory and present action, slightly wider for the century-ago teaching moment. The prose carries a distinct texture—lyric compression, invented compounds ("Moon Hollowed," "reef-shadow joy"), syntactic patience. Purposeful elision (war details, the mechanics of the shell's discovery) serves the accumulative design. One slip: "Somewhere, a war was ending" in the penultimate paragraph briefly floats free of Minerva's knowledge frame, reading as authorial assertion rather than her inference.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-limited, with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture in diction ("diamond-hard and achingly simple," "indifferent waters," "purple-throated"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices crystalline details, extinct phenomena, the library's architecture. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the ritual, wider during the journey). However, elevated register is pervasive ("phonemes had dissolved like sugar," "solidified moonlight") and occasionally drifts from caretaker lexicon into literary ornament. No head-hopping. The prose reflects Mira's contemplative state, though under peak pressure (the restoration) the diction remains equally elevated rather than compressing toward immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV (Maren) is stable; psychic distance and narrative certainty remain consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("cathedral of silence," "careful recklessness," "cautious exuberance coloring each syllable"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; Elias's lines feel distinct in rhythm and lexicon ("That sounds terrifying" vs. Maren's technical excitement). Minor filter-verb presence ("She watched understanding dawn") does not dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is professional (linguistic terminology) but remains accessible; no head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature—machines as sleeping giants, balance between fear and need—filtering every detail. The prose modulates appropriately (clinical precision during the adhesive test, emotional intensity at the confession's revelation). Occasional elevated diction ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") feels slightly imposed rather than emerging from Mira's idiom, and the phrase "murder dressed as negligence" reads more authorial than character-voiced. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "dust motes swirl in the single beam," "the word bloomed in her chest." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the confession beat. However, the final journal passage ("Trust, she wrote, is learning...") drifts toward essayistic summary that feels slightly outside Elara's immediate voice under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional, naturalistic in Mira's "Show me" and the exchange about birds. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The prose reflects Elara's contemplative stance without filter-verb stacking, though the closing metaphor ("something that had long been withering finally began to bloom") edges toward declarative certainty that could be more image-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Wren's perceptual signature: intuiting history through wood grain, translating weather codes as prayers. Diction is consistently lyric and voice-motivated ("fractured hush," "featherly determined"), with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between sensory immediacy and reflective depth. One register note: "She couldn't explain why his hand suddenly trembled" briefly reports the father's interiority from across impossible distance, a minor POV leak that doesn't break focalization but softens distance control at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Marina's perceptual signature (reading stars for earth, not humans; noticing shadowseam wonder). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. Diction stays consistent and controlled, with purposeful elevation ("pilgrimage," "captivating," "softly ingenious") that fits Marina's scholarly background without slipping into academic register during peak emotional beats. Theo's "softly ingenious" smile is shown through action (finding clever ways around problems) before being named.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "cheerful gloom like a second skin," "transliterates emotions into something navigable." POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (beauty and sorrow coexist). Diction remains character-apt except one slip: "via the scattered path of a creature following ancient instincts" elevates into academic register during peak conjecture beat, briefly pulling reader out of Mira's embodied present. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Marina notices acoustic geometry, traffic patterns, and timing with professional specificity. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("orchestrated serendipity," "calculated wilderness"). The prose modulates appropriately, tightening during the performance and opening for reflection. One minor filter-verb stack appears in the opening paragraph ("adjusted," "studied") but doesn't muddy clarity. The narrative maintains appropriate certainty; Marina's knowledge of her father's philosophy and her own methods reads as earned expertise rather than convenient omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited through Selene with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is distinct—"observing gaps," motion-as-mathematics, tide-dancer idiom. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Kira's lines carry subtext (hunger, desperation). One friction: the phrase "spontaneously anchored to the cosmic rhythm" reads slightly expository and could be more concretely embodied. Diction remains mostly within voice, though "cosmic alphabet" leans slightly elevated for the moment's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; Elena's perceptual signature (light, pattern, physics metaphors) is consistent. Reflection dominates but anchors to present stimuli (stone throw, mist thinning, captain's reaction). No head-hopping. Minor diction elevations ("noctilucent reckonings," "theater of light") occasionally drift above a working glazier's likely interior lexicon under pressure, though they remain legible. No dialogue to evaluate. Rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable distance throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: firefighter's skilled navigation, belief in fairness "burned away," scar-tracking. Diction remains controlled and character-apt (mechanic metaphors, survival logic). The reflection is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (box, path, clearing) and interleaved with micro-choices (continuing climb, opening pouch). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the epiphany beat. Voice is distinct and consistent under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Marina's perceptual signature: she filters the grotto through physicist language ("quantum entanglement formulas," "variable that separated"), and her grandmother's trial-balloon wisdom colors her interpretive frame. Distance is consistent, and the voice carries a distinct rhythm ("logical dreamer," "hold contradictions like water in cupped hands") that modulates naturally with emotional pressure. A few phrases edge toward elevated register outside urgent moments ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful") but remain voice-motivated rather than disruptive. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and purposeful. Internal thought stays character-particular, and the final shift in tone (from desperate longing to calm determination) reads as earned progression rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear in Mira's professional filter (vibrations dismissed by others, acoustic sensors, mapping terminology) blended with mystical receptivity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("Legacy's burden settled on her shoulders like the weight of accumulated stone") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-organic during peak discovery beats. The narrative voice modulates appropriately between technical observation and wonder, though some phrases ("sensitively perceptive since childhood") tell rather than dramatize the trait through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated diction ("dusky harmony," "borrowed heartbeats," "revolution of reflection"). Psychic distance is consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears. The narrative voice is textured but uniform across emotional beats, lacking modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("She understood," "She knew") appear frequently, dulling immediacy in a few high-importance moments.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at "throat constricted," wider at "indifferent...celestial bodies"). Diction fits a weary diplomat's register without filter-verb excess. Dialogue for Theron and Kell is spare and goal-driven, carrying subtext in brevity. Perceptual signature—Elara's "flawed beauty" lens—is consistent. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" reads slightly elevated for peak interiority, and the final paragraph's cadence ("She intended to keep paying") edges toward summary rather than scene-specific perception under pressure. No head-hopping or major voice breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Eleanor filters the salt flat through her guilt and sentiment, notices "the mathematics of mercy," and hears "the fractured grace of lost songs." Psychic distance is controlled and modulates appropriately. Some diction ("manufactured drought had been her masterpiece," "sentimental nonsense") reads slightly elevated for peak moments but remains within her lexicon as a wealthy industrialist. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice is confident and particular, though a few phrases ("stubborn as grief") lean toward lyricism that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct lyric texture ("each flake a whispered secret," "alarming serenity"). Psychic distance is controlled and voice modulates appropriately with ritual intensity. However, elevated diction in peak beats ("liminal moment," "sovereign choice," "architecture of boundaries") drifts above the embodied present, and some stock metaphors ("made of the same fire that lights the stars") flatten the inherited voices into generic wisdom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is poetic but occasionally abstract rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Vera's "That's not fair" (twice) reveals her resistance and capitulation in shorthand. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marcus notices the carved faces shifting in peripheral vision, the acoustics, the dust—all filtering through his artist's attention. Voice modulates appropriately from reflective opening to pressured performance to quiet closure. Minor deduction: some dialogue ("All storytelling is manipulation") risks thesis-speak, though it remains in-character for a self-aware artist.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters all detail through Vera's professional lens (esoteric realist, keeper of overlooked histories). Diction is elevated but consistent: "blushing stillness," "interrupted cadence," "verdant grotto." Some phrases ("too strange for textbooks, too true for myth") verge on thesis statement but remain anchored in her work. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrative certainty matches Vera's knowledge. Minor elevation in register ("esoteric realism," "collective memory encoded in the landscape") fits her scholarly frame but occasionally tips toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited holds stable distance and perceptual signature: Elin notices through a caster's idiom ("contours," "give in ancient fibers," "mold and metal"). Diction remains within her artisan lexicon; no register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully—longer contemplative lines early ("As a lost wax caster, she had spent thirty years…") compress to fragments under peak pressure ("The aurora faded. The ice sang with names."). No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean ("She understood now why the sanctum existed"). Elision of the melody itself is purposeful and legible: we experience its effect (names surface, aurora pulses) without transcription, matching the story's premise that sound transcends notation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the seal-break flood, wider during the climb out). Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "ethereal grit" and "precisely playful" fitting the tone. Two frictions: "The paths whispered gratitude" and "the bunker hummed with approval" anthropomorphize environment in a way that softens POV modesty, and the voice occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("phantom timelines," "roads not taken") that feels slightly templated rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt. Diction (ziggurat, clerestory, schematic representations, empirically ironic) is elevated but consistent with Mira's academic voice. Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the observation sequence. However, perceptual signature is thin—Mira's way of noticing feels generic astronomer rather than distinctly hers. Filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "attributed this to") are voice-motivated and acceptable. No dialogue appears; the piece is introspective monologue in narration. Register occasionally drifts into Wikipedia-voice exposition ("a Persian polymath who believed...") that flattens intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mireva throughout, with clean psychic distance and no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("shifting grace," "strategic healer") that fits the mythic frame. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "resentment like a second skeleton" and "reality shifted like breath" showing a consistent perceptual signature. However, some constructions lean toward purple ("each small violence recorded in metal") and the occasional filter verb ("watched him stumble") dulls immediacy. Dialogue is absent except for the signed line "You cannot hear me, but you can feel me," which reads as functional exposition rather than subtext-laden exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is distinct: "fog was the breath of boundaries dissolving" and craft-specific perception mark Elara's perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("exhalation of a world forgetting its own edges") that, while beautiful, borders on over-articulation for a character deep in urgent work. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly bound to Mira's focalization; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: "slower than a drunk beetle," "stubborn creature," "triply cursed" feel character-specific and voice-motivated. Dialogue distinguishes Petra's sharpness from Mira's wry patience, and subtext operates cleanly ("It's just a ribbon" / "It's a promise"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority (the whirring eye, the daughter's handwriting) to wider atmospheric shots. One minor slip: "endearingly feisty" in narration reads slightly more authorial than Mira's established idiom, though it's brief. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no filter-verb stacks or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's curious, philosophical attention filters the surreal setting. Phrases like "brightened disquiet" and "simply complicated" attempt a consistent idiolect but edge toward ornamental abstraction under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The grandmother's journal notes ("Don't ask why. Just trust the tiles.") read as a convenient voice insert rather than earned character texture. Psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is consistent. Diction carries a lyric-philosophical register ("unheard symphonies," "silence hopes to become sound") that fits the arcane-linguist frame, though phrases like "wounded guardian" and "patient as always, but perhaps—for the first time—hopeful" veer toward narrator-voice philosophizing rather than Mira's direct perception. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the time traveler's exposition ("I've seen seventeen versions") and Mira's aphoristic replies feel more thematic than embodied speech. Perceptual signature is present in the gap-research lens but not deeply idiosyncratic under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV; perceptual signature is consistent ("watching her reflection split and merge," "fog has been my home so long"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant joy") that reads slightly imposed rather than organic to Maya's crisis state. The sister's voice converges with Maya's idiom at their encounter, which fits thematic mirroring but lacks distinct rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully around key images.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices with an archivist's eye, filtering detail through organizational systems. Diction remains controlled with purposeful elevation ("frozen waterfall," "ancient dance") that suits the setting and stakes. One minor slip: "The fables of absence, she understood now, were never about loss" reads slightly expository, pausing to explain rather than letting image carry meaning. No dialogue to evaluate. Overall, voice is distinct and distance is well-managed with compression during the rope work appropriately reflecting focused effort.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: professional precision in "ripple-mark," "bloom of hush," technical observation balanced against lyric compression in "hammered repose" and "pregnant with the absence of noise." POV remains stable; knowledge stays character-bound (Vera interprets via touch and sound, never claims the beings' intentions). Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads environment as text (crack patterns like braille, spiral suggesting draft). Distance modulates purposefully: clinical during assessment, compressed-lyric at closure. The phrase "hammered repose" enters naturally through her embodied state rather than as authorial imposition.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is present in Mira's attention to fragments, visions, and light. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush") that occasionally tips into ornamental phrasing without dramatized pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent rather than dulling immediacy. The prose texture is purposeful and imagistic, though phrases like "the sky turning the color of infected wounds" skew slightly precious for crisis memory.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (she feels voices through stone, tastes storm-charged air). Diction remains elevated but character-apt for an archivist; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority during the shadow-dial conjecture, wider lyric zoom during descent. Weakness: several figurative constructions cluster without full payoff ("fog solidified into pale marble," "rivers carrying sediment," "clay from which each generation molded") and one phrase—"electric taste of storm-charged air"—leans stock. Filter verbs ("she could sense," "she understood") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Elara's perceptual signature (chanting rhythms, ambient awareness, fire-craft focus) is distinct. Dialogue between Elara and her grandmother is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext. Diction is elevated and lyrical, fitting the voice, though occasional phrases ("serious playfulness," "purposeful ambient awareness") feel slightly like prompt labels rather than organic thought. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mira; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during confession, wider for the grotto's "ancient and patient" reflection). Diction is mostly controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (tidal-pool chronicler's eye). Dialogue carries subtext: Elena's "That doesn't explain anything" softens via line rhythm, and her final "Maybe you could teach me" pursues reconciliation obliquely. Minor deduction: "warmly observant of her own memory" and "warmly observant of this fragile new beginning" are slightly elevated and repeat the same phrase, creating a minor filter-verb echo.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent (silences "tasted," doll "intangibly tangible"). Diction matches Mira's introspective register throughout. The phrase "stretching contracted, expanding and tightening" momentarily compresses too many simultaneous contradictions in one beat, but recovers immediately. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the final image maintains voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, filtering all perception through Eris's acoustic expertise and grief. Diction reflects her professional lexicon ("harmonic storms," "crystalline rot," "atmospheric memory") without slipping into exposition. Perceptual signature is distinct: she reads the world through sound, noticing cable frequencies and pressure-pattern shifts invisible to passengers. Prose rhythm modulates purposefully, accelerating at the vial's opening and settling into the final hum. No dialogue present; interiority remains concrete and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with controlled psychic distance and diction that matches Meridia's scholarly perspective ("cataloging," "mythic path," "failsafe"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads signs, lifts paint carefully, works methodically. Register remains consistent except for one mild drift ("algorithmic governance" feels slightly expository). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates rhythm with sentence variety—short declaratives at key turns ("She climbed") balance longer descriptive passages. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person close POV on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "ritual of loaded emptiness," "pregnant pause between connection and isolation." Dialogue is minimal, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You found me" / "Your scars called to mine"). Minor register drift: "tender shadow keeper" and "shadow keeper arts" read slightly elevated for the intimate voice, but remain legible within the conceptual frame. Psychic distance is stable; the prose reflects Mira's careful, ritualized mindset. Under peak pressure (lifting the doorknocker), syntax compresses appropriately without obscuring interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and voice throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (recognizing patterns in chaos, analyzing recruitment scripts) and the diction generally fits Vera's engineering/survivor mindset. However, elevated metaphorical register at peak beats ("grief made gorgeous," "alchemy that mattered," "shadowseam between what was lost and what could still be grown") drifts from the grounded voice established earlier. Filter verbs and passive constructions appear but don't systematically dull immediacy. The final phone message provides clean closure texture without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register suited to Margaret's introspective stance ("eloquently silent," "fragile architecture spanning the chasm"). Diction occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("frequencies most people drowned out with noise and ambition"), but the interior texture stays coherent under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose reflects Margaret's meditative, pattern-seeking mind.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and appropriate. Diction is elevated and consistent—"shivering bliss," "loamy soil," "cathedral vastness"—matching the fantasy-mystical register. Perceptual signature is present: Aldric notices symbols, armor weight, and glowing fruit through a knight's lens. However, at peak pressure ("Aldric understood now," "he was the marionette and the puppeteer both") the prose shifts into explanatory mode rather than staying in embodied perception. Filter verbs ("felt the shivering bliss," "glimpsed other worlds") are acceptable for the voice but cluster at the climax, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Eleanor reads dust "like scripture" and traces ink with "reverent fingers." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate at the button discovery, pulling back for the final reflection. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Diction remains within Eleanor's scholarly yet tender register throughout. The prose rhythm tightens during the file discovery and expands for the closing meditation, matching emotional pressure without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual filter (light-reading, geometric navigation, historical awareness). The prose maintains appropriate distance and interiority. Minor slips: "holding the line against the tyranny of indifference" in both thought and final reflection feels like prompt-language rather than character idiom under stress. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she found") are present but don't flatten immediacy. No dialogue to assess. The narrator's certainty about off-page events (enforcers' report, global truth-surfacing) slightly exceeds POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the saxophonist notices through a musician's lens (brass, frequencies, interference patterns). Diction is elevated and lyrical, matching the reflective, ritualistic tone. The piece leans heavily on reflection and backstory (~35% of text), but each block anchors to present stimuli (lifting the instrument, beginning to play) and the mode remains coherent. Filter verbs ("felt the prophecy rising," "felt the words") cluster in the final third without obscuring immediacy, staying within the contemplative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("perpetually overcast realm," "slender probe tipped with a moonstone cabochon dust speck") matches Wren's devotional focus without slipping into clinical detachment. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, peak-beat phrasing leans abstract: "feeling mossy delight bloom in her chest like something long dormant finally finding sun" is figuratively dense but borders on generic uplift. Perceptual signature is clear—Wren notices weight, shell, vein-patterns—but under peak stress (the hush, the dissolution) the prose does not compress or fracture; it remains lyrically steady.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during reflection, wider during descent). Voice carries a distinct rhythmic texture: "uncertainly certain," "magnificently imprecise and utterly true." Perceptual signature is consistent (gears, brass, precision instruments filter her observations). No dialogue appears. Reflection is substantial (~25–30%) but anchored to present stimuli (waterfall, compass, logbook) and interleaved with micro-choices (lifting the compass, digging, reading). Brief register drift: "imposing order on entropy itself" and "befriend uncertainty in planning" feel slightly elevated for the character's practitioner idiom under peak discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Mira notices alchemical specifics, metallurgical detail, the foundry's history). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("luminous shadows," "sacred concentration"). The brief dialogue to the empty air ("I'm going to finish what you started") reads natural and goal-driven. However, register occasionally drifts into slightly elevated philosophical phrasing ("factually mystical," "transcendent," "conceptual Repricing vocabulary") that, while thematically apt, edges beyond the immediate embodied texture of a working alchemist under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "modestly fearless" filters her apprehension, the tooth's warmth registers physically, echoes carry "fragments" that accumulate. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("opaque as river fog," "throat of striated stone"). The spirits' brief dialogue is distinct and purposeful. Minor slip: "Tears streamed down her face, luminous in the growing light" slightly externalizes the emotional peak rather than filtering it through her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. The prose carries a distinct texture—"ultraviolet pain," "seismograph of suffering"—that conveys Elena's heightened sensory state. Perceptual signature is strong: every physical sensation is a trauma doorway. However, elevated diction ("supernatural precision," "moral calculus") occasionally drifts above a tortured actuary's interior lexicon under peak stress. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Voice modulates with intensity but maintains consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("elusively tangible sensation that was neither touch nor sight but something between") and voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the material. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic poetic phrasing ("that strange country of becoming," "palms in prayer," "weightlessness of choosing") that could belong to any introspective narrator. The vendor's single line of dialogue is clean but brief. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the prose maintains clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Miriam notices dust accumulation patterns, ceiling strata, the seam in the baseboard—details filtered through her technician's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("voices like wind through paper," "geological strata"). The ghost's dialogue feels natural and purposeful, advancing plot through revelation. Psychic distance modulates intentionally during the flashback to Miriam's grandmother. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent and employs purposeful compression ("clouds that remembered nothing and forgot even less," "rupture"). Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the immediate scene needs ("vibrational key," "negotiable reality") in ways that feel more lyric-ornamental than character-particular. The perceptual signature is present but relies heavily on abstract metaphysics rather than Maren's specific, embodied way of noticing under pressure. Rhythm modulates well at the climax (short bursts as she pulls the lever).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "ink-stained fingers," "heart that spoke in verse," temporal currents seen as "thick and golden." Diction remains in register throughout, and the verse fragments are voice-motivated. One slip: "The civilization hadn't died. They had seen time coming—visible, inevitable, beautiful—and they had chosen to step sideways into it" shifts briefly into expository certainty that feels slightly elevated for the focalizer's lived texture. The final poem's syntax and rhythm match Maren's established voice. Psychic distance is controlled, deepening appropriately at the mirror moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias hears "songs things wished to sing" and notices "rusted springs" and "corroded mechanisms" through a repairman's lens. Diction stays character-bound ("sympathetic harmonics," "minor key," "tinkersong wonder"). Free indirect control is clean; the recognition "I'm sorry" lands as embodied realization. Rhythm modulates from meditative setup to the climactic winding sequence. No dialogue present; voice remains stable and purpose-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Maren's professional lens (petrichor as memory, psychometry's emotional residue) colors every observation. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. The psychometry vision maintains clean focalization (she sees Vennard's experience, does not become him). Prose rhythm modulates effectively from measured descent to charged stillness at closure. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present: Marina notices "twisted forms," "grain," "visual language." However, elevated diction throughout ("timewoven alliances," "perpetually learning," "nodes in a network") clashes with the sculptor's hands-on craft, creating register drift that flattens voice under pressure. The final paragraph's syntax ("a mechanical lullaby for a woman finally awake") reads writerly rather than character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices light, glass mechanics, and the handwritten notes on postcards. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during glass study, wider during mural completion). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though phrases like "umbral tenderness" and "something like breath" approach elevated register. No head-hopping. The piece teaches its reflective, accumulative pattern early. Light filter-verb presence ("found herself," "began to reckon") is voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. Compression in the final section (visitors, additions each autumn) maintains internal texture without POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Celeste with a consistent archival-lyric register. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices testimonies, encrypted patterns, heat-ghosts, and silence as data. Dialogue (two brief exchanges with the grandmother) is goal-driven and advances plot without filler. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("searing reverie," "bittersweet knowledge") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under peak pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance is controlled and fits Mira's reflective, philosophical cast. Perceptual signature is consistent (alchemist's lens on memory, meaning, integrity). Diction elevates appropriately for the fantasy-philosophical register ("communion," "murder of meaning," "crystallized intention"), though some phrases ("paradox of glass," "accumulated weight of ordinary moments") feel slightly over-polished for urgent interiority. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is steady, though sentence openings recur (multiple "She [verb]" constructions in the middle third).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct texture (archaic diction: "venerable," "cuneiform," "docent"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider observation. The reflection on the third-grade museum visit is cleanly anchored and shifts present stance by explaining Maren's gift. However, elevated register occasionally drifts ("velvet disquiet," "proto-language that had no name") into ornamental phrasing that prioritizes atmosphere over character-specific perception. No dialogue appears. The prose reflects the focalizer's scholarly idiom, though some constructions ("the breath between worlds," "frequencies of grief and wonder") trend toward poetic abstraction rather than Maren's lived thought-texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with controlled distance. Voice carries a distinct lyric-contemplative register ("cathedral of ice," "brief constellations," "luminous serpent") that fits the protagonist's reverent relationship to her task. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices crystalline structure, seed varieties, and generational objects. Some diction edges toward elevated register ("molecular alignment," "crystalline matrix") that risks distancing but remains plausible for a specialized custodian. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with the vortex descent.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Mira's professional perception: "credibly curious," instrument-focused, attuned to pressure shifts. Diction ("windblown cathedral," "unfiltered by the world's accumulated grief," "wallpaper, background static") carries a distinct lyric texture without violating her focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during instrument observation, slightly elevated during the bell-pull to capture communal witness. No head-hopping; the keepers' recognition is filtered through Mira's awareness of their gaze. Minor register elevation ("obsolete," "equilibrium") fits her technical expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Mira "traced the path...with weathered fingers," "felt its journey as if it were her own pulse." Diction remains consistent and character-particular. The extended reflection on vulnerability and smallness fits BRR allowance (taught pattern, anchored in present sweeping ritual). Minor register drift: "primal elegance" and "tender exposure of an open heart" in late paragraphs introduce elevated phrasing that clashes slightly with the tactile, grounded voice established earlier. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature filtering detail through Maren's tranquil attentiveness ("noting how they clutched invisible objects"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("astonished still by how much silence could hold"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the ghost encounter, pulling back for the reflective ending. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Maren's interpretive limits ("recognition, perhaps, or hope").

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Vera's perceptual signature (sensing "temporal decay," feeling "sediment layers" through touch). Diction is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated by the conceptual premise. The phrase "suddenly timeless" recurs as a leitmotif rather than head-hopping. No dialogue appears. One register slip: "emotional archaeology" and "anticipated mysteries" edge toward abstraction in a piece otherwise grounded in concrete sensation. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; distance is controlled and perceptual signature is present ("warmly attentive to its imperfections"). Dialogue is natural and advances plot—"It's ruined" and "Sometimes different carries its own kind of flight"—though the latter edges toward thesis statement. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated but remains within Mira's poetic sensibility. Free indirect style is clean. The boy's voice is distinct enough (child simplicity vs. Mira's lyricism). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Maren's perception throughout; her perceptual signature—reading growth patterns, the "brazen calm," systematic observation—is distinct and consistent. Distance is controlled: we access her choices and memories (grandmother's diary, forty years of work) without head-hopping. The prose reflects her patient, methodical mindset even under terminal pressure. Diction stays within her register—"mineral consciousness," "remodeling the relationship"—without forced elevation. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, third-limited on Mira, remains stable. Perceptual signature is academic-turned-experiential: "She had studied chemistry before turning to anthropology" filters the amber through molecular knowledge. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("bronze quiet," "artificial pilgrimage"). No dialogue on the page. The phrase "luminous now, lit from within" risks slight abstraction under peak pressure but the closing descent grounds it in action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("blooming jetty," "narrow vastness," "submerged concord") matches Erasmus's linguist mind and sustains pressure without drift. Focalization remains stable third-limited; his perceptual signature filters setting through linguistic and botanical priorities (guttural consonants, nitrogen content, seed rotation). Psychic distance tightens at closure. No dialogue; all interaction occurs through bird calls rendered as "stones grinding underwater" and "wind through broken windows," maintaining voice coherence. Purposeful compression (three years collapsed into "not since the reef died") and patterned elision (the war, the village's extinction) are taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marta's bloodhound instincts, scent-based perception, and memory filter. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Ven's lines carry purpose. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the memory and closure beats. Minor: a few filter verbs ("she realized," "she remembered") in mid-beats slightly dull immediacy, and the phrase "intuitively descriptive in their movements" momentarily shifts register without clear POV motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close throughout; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ship's approach. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("time stretched thin as spider silk," "stars that moved like honey through the darkness") that matches Mira's contemplative isolation without tipping into purple excess. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices stellar positions, journal wear, applique damage—details filtered through her astronomer's eye and family inheritance. One minor slip: "temporal-patient fingers" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly over-constructed, a self-conscious descriptor that breaks the established rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Corwin; perceptual signature is consistent (wonder-focused, chivalrous). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sacredly playful reverence," "cautious abandon") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect thought is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the letter-reading beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited with tight interiority; Vera's perceptual signature is consistent—she reads gestures (teacup angle, pawn absence) as communicative acts, filtering the palace through survivor's lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence" feel voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No dialogue present (correctly, given the empty gallery). Psychic distance is stable; the shift to naming herself is motivated by accumulation, not arbitrary. One minor register slip: "authentic trauma made the simulations more convincing" reads slightly expository in an otherwise embodied paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with lyric compression that serves voice: "mercury and memory" as perceptual signature, "the outline of something she had forgotten—not a memory, but a shape." Distance modulates purposefully (close during tracing, wider during hundred-night backstory anchor). No head-hopping. Diction stays within Vera's plausible register—archival, embodied, precise. The prose reflects her state: fragmented early ("bleeding out each dawn"), cohering through repetition ("night by night"). Sentence rhythm accelerates in the final third without blur. One minor slip: "hidden thunder" appears only in narration, not enacted through syntax or image in peak beats, leaving the tonal cue slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and close, filtering setting through Marcus's guilt: "productive in their restlessness," "the woven hush deepened around him." Diction stays consistent—elevated but never diagnostic—and psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the mirror, wider at the village's resumption). Perceptual signature is present: he notices threads, geometry, the chess piece's weight. No dialogue appears, so voice relies on narrative rhythm, which accelerates at the labyrinth's center and breathes at closure. One minor slip: "fierce repose" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly authorial rather than Marcus's lexicon, though it echoes the final required tone.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Sera with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (paint-stained fingers, artist's noticing). Diction is controlled and purposeful, avoiding filter-verb stacks. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. The phrase "forged hush" is elegant but slightly elevated for peak pressure; otherwise voice remains clean and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable; Vera's perceptual signature (alchemical framing, workshop as cathedral) is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates under pressure: "dire enchantment, terrible and beautiful" and "quilting something new from something broken" read slightly elevated against the concrete gear-work. The "between breaths held underwater" metaphor sustains across the liminal compression beat. No dialogue present; interior voice is character-specific. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she saw...she saw") in the compressed-time passage don't fully obscure immediacy but slightly dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close; psychic distance tightens during the painting scene. Perceptual signature is consistent: Edwin notices art-making details (mineral tears, luminous pools, "living punctuation") filtered through a painter's eye. The phrase "intimately aloof" is slightly over-articulated for the voice but functions as a compass for his stance. No dialogue to evaluate. Diction occasionally elevates ("phosphorescent," "temporality") but remains within an educated artist's lexicon. Some filter verbs ("he understood," "he saw") could sharpen to immediacy, but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-close on Mira; perceptual signature is evident in her attention to breath, texture, and vibrations. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the boy's "I didn't mean to" and Mira's "Your mother was right" carry subtext about grief and validation. Diction is controlled—"bruise against the pale morning sky," "fingers like dried flowers"—though some phrases ("heat-induced stillness," "desperate thought could thrum") slide toward elevated abstraction. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "the vibrations of intent" paragraph tilts into exposition. The final paragraph's long compound sentence maintains rhythm under emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV control is clean throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature consistent (navigator's eye for coordinates, charts, mechanical details) and diction appropriate to her makeshift expertise. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the construction sequence. The phone voice's fragments carry authentic mystery and purpose. The future-self reveal maintains focalization but introduces a slight temporal paradox that strains the established narrative distance without full preparation, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren filters the world through rational detachment, soil science idiom, and cost-benefit calculation ("mathematics of survival," "honest language of mycelia"). Voice modulates under pressure (the weeping moment compresses syntax fittingly). The single line of dialogue ("My name is Maren. I am happy.") advances plot and carries subtext (testing the device's power). Minor deduction: "families dissolve under the weight of truths never meant to surface" and "secrets spill like water through her fingers" verge on generic phrasing in the backstory block, slightly flattening the idiom during reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Elias notices silences, names storms, reads borrowed memories as "driftwood." Distance is stable third-limited with clean access to his interior. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific ("achingly familiar," "faithful archivist of phantom experiences," "softly persistent pull"). The borrowed-memory passages shift to sensory fragments ("A young man's hands, not his own") without head-hopping—framed as intrusions Elias receives. Rhythm modulates purposefully, tightening as the mist thickens. No dialogue present to judge. Minor friction: "stubborn as alpine flowers in thin air" in the inscription feels slightly elevated for a lighthouse keeper's spontaneous phrasing, though the moment's gravity may license it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited through Eleanor's perceptual lens. Her "empirically intuitive sense" colors observations throughout (ants as life's guide, the chip as key). Diction is controlled and specific: "hollowed her out," "water level would determine her window." The father's dialogue at the threshold reads naturally for a supernatural/visionary encounter. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority in the shop to embodied action in the cavern. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the prose maintains character-particular rhythm under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the queen's noticing is shaped by her dual roles (girlhood climber, burdened monarch) and the prose modulates with her emotional state—terse and physical during the climb, more reflective in the grotto, propulsive at descent. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("You came after the final warning" / "I came because of it"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "her voice softly commanding despite the exhaustion" slightly tells what the surrounding action already shows, though the phrase serves character continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Mira's perceptual lens (she notices logarithmic spirals, alchemical fire, wavelengths). Diction is elevated and consistent—"convergence of ancient thermal vents," "density she needed to capture"—matching a scholarly alchemist's register. Dialogue carries subtext (Theo's "you'll return differently" both warns and seduces) and advances the thematic argument without feeling expository. One minor slip: "scientifically romantic" and "palette of resolve reforming" edge toward prompt-label phrasing, but the voice remains coherent under pressure and the final lines modulate naturally into quieter reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Vera's perceptual signature—she notices handwriting texture, dream architecture, temporal markers. Diction stays character-appropriate: "feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "chronicler's curse" feel like her professional lexicon. One minor slip: "jade of her exhaustion" (should be "jaded" as adjective, not noun) creates brief confusion. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during scroll-reading and opening during landscape observation. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and texture-specific: "trembling calm," "occluded views," "poetry in their patient dripping." Distance is stable third-limited on Elena. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext (Margaret's whisper, Elena's "May I?"). Some diction skews elevated for continuous use—"occluded views," "emotional terrain," "fossilized in corrosion"—but remains within a literary register that the piece teaches early. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: Elena reads bodies after losing smell, notes tension and curl. Minor: "trembling calm" recurs as both phrase and tone, risking self-annotation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinct (amber twilight, ink-drop eyes, saturated hush). Diction remains within Mira's apprentice-scholar register throughout. Narrative certainty matches what she knows; the water-damaged manuscript is inference presented as such. One purposeful compression: "Count the crows, little one. One for sorrow, two for joy" drops into present thought without filter, voice-motivated by memory trigger. Minor slip: "She would explain that the ice was not a flaw to be purged but a language to be spoken" edges toward expository summary of future intent in the penultimate paragraph, though it quickly grounds in concrete commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and distinctive, blending ecclesiastical diction ("cassock," "doctrine") with noir texture ("gossip-column exorcist," "the papers had called it a heart attack"). Marcus's perceptual signature—seeing spiritual mechanics through metaphor and electromagnetic principle—is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Eleanor's "You always advises through metaphors" has a grammatical slip ("advises" for "advise") that feels unintentional rather than voice-specific. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately between reflection and action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual access. Diction carries a formal, elevated register throughout ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact") that fits the mythic frame. However, the voice lacks character-specific texture; phrases like "journeying inward while walking out" and "spiral arbitration" feel imported rather than filtered through the witness's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") appear frequently without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure, flattening emotional intensity at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature tied to Einar's profession ("singing" clocks, "patient flow," "fjord quiet"). Diction stays consistent and purposeful: "hydraulic clock shepherd," "mantle clock key," "razor edges" recur with evolving meaning. Psychic distance tightens during the countdown without head-hopping. The prose reflects Einar's mind under pressure: short declaratives during counting, sensory expansion as edges appear. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor note: "eminently peculiar profession" briefly elevates register but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (mathematical framing, attention to patterns and odds). Diction is controlled and voice-specific, though occasional phrases ("theoretically rebellious," "beautiful impossibility") feel slightly elevated beyond the established register. The reflection-heavy mode is purposeful and anchored to present stimuli (textbook, lantern, rain). No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains steady. Minor: "traverse" appears repeatedly in slightly forced constructions ("traverse the distance," "traverse the rain-slicked streets").

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Vera with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture: "rotary dial that clicked like teeth," "grief was circular," "silence was full, germinating." Perceptual signature is selective (the disc's curve, the tunnel's unstable light, the phone's specific ring time). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the woman's "Danny, please" and Vera's gentle corrections pursue connection through indirection. Filter verbs appear but feel voice-motivated ("Vera understood," "Vera could feel"). Minor slip: "The effect was melodically haunted" in paragraph four shifts briefly into external narrator commentary rather than Vera's specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Marguerite's perception. Voice carries a slightly elevated, archival register ("steep the harbor," "stained glass") that fits the archivist frame. The Keeper's dialogue ("Through proximate causes, hope persists") reads as thesis-speak rather than emergent character voice. Psychic distance tightens during the locket moment but remains explanatory ("she had been doing sacred work without knowing it") rather than compressing under pressure. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Maya with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a wry, compact texture ("desperately jocular even with herself") and modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Okonkwo's "rather rude" and Maya's fox-vineyard quip establish character quickly. Free indirect style is clean. One friction: Maya's interior voice and Okonkwo's speech share similar register and wit (both deploy dry humor and abstract phrasing), reducing distinction under emotional peaks. Filter verbs ("watched," "understood") appear but remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Meridia's synesthetic perception ("felt the tree's language seep into her skin," "heard it not with her ears but through the soles of her worn boots"). Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent—she translates vibrations the way others translate ink. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from close sensory absorption to brief reflective pulls. Minor slips: "the dialect of abandoned nests, the grammar of forgotten streams" edges toward elevated register in a peak beat, and "beautiful, aching complexity" in the final line reads slightly generic against the otherwise specific perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Vera's scientific training colors her observations (probability cascades, translation matrices), and the prose modulates appropriately under pressure. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent. No dialogue present, so those bullets are waived. The piece maintains narrative distance without head-hopping. Minor slip: "the knowledge that history could be edited, that wrong seeds could sometimes be replanted" in the penultimate paragraph slightly over-articulates the thematic takeaway in a way that reduces trust in the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV through Mira is stable and filters the world through her priorities—framing compositions, mapping silences, reading vibrations. Sign language dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven, advancing both character and plot. Elena's voice reads distinct in her urgency and exhaustion. One register slip: "quietly charismatic in the way of morning fog—present everywhere, touching everything, yet somehow intangible" reads overly polished for Mira's internal texture under the established voice. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, anchored to Miriam's perceptual signature ("cataloging every shadow"). Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with an educated, obsessive archivist. Two register slips weaken peak beats: "volcanic tenderness" in the backstory paragraph reads more like authorial poetry than Miriam's thought, and "grief so tender it could have melted stone" ventures into metaphoric overstatement during the emotional climax. Purposeful compression (the library fire's summary, the seventeen-year search) is economical, and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Mira notices through her altered nervous system ("frequencies only Mira could feel"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("small defiances that kept her soul from calcifying under authority"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close embodiment and slightly elevated lyricism. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can know; Elias's memories are clearly framed as entangled with hers. One minor register wobble: "auroral sorrow filled the air" reads slightly explanatory rather than strictly filtered through Mira's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Celia throughout. Her perceptual signature (identifying walks, trusting sound over sight) is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; the man's lines pursue goals ("help me find what I'm looking for"). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Minor: some diction ("cartographer," "geomagnetic storm") sits at the edge of Celia's working-class register without fully breaking it, and the man's philosophical speech feels slightly elevated for the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature (meticulous noticing, dental mirror as tool, silence as language) consistently filtering all detail. Distance modulates purposefully: close during shutter manipulation, wider during the boy's departure. Diction ("stillwater tension," "spiralingly calm") is voice-motivated and rhythmically controlled under pressure. Minor deduction for one instance of elevated register ("acknowledgment…promise that being witnessed was enough") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon, and the recycled phrase "spiralingly calm" appearing twice without fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; Eleanor's perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, chess-strategic thinking) is consistent. Diction elevates at times ("bruise on the evening," "amplified quiet") but remains within a literary-reflective register appropriate to the voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider social observation. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets don't apply. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (library, grotto, chess pieces) and primes the closure stance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly on Mira; psychic distance modulates well (close during transformation reflection, outward during action). Diction is mostly consistent, though "combative in its tenderness" and "the Treaty of Still Waters" edge toward elevated register. Jonas's dialogue ("You're going to hurt yourself" / "your heart") carries subtext and goal (persuade her to stay), and his rough "Find your freedom" shifts stance credibly. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Mira's theatrical self-narration ("our heroine retrieves the sacred knife") filters every observation. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative voice modulates between her performed announcements and her quieter interiority without head-hopping. Diction stays within her performer's lexicon. Minor deduction: "morally ambiguous in the eyes of the state" and "cultivate lightness in grief" slip into slightly elevated, thematic register not fully grounded in her immediate sensory frame under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mora notices quartz frequencies, reads ice as text, frames beauty as compass. Diction—"cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," "crystalline air"—is lyric and voice-consistent. One slip: "The Council had feared what her words dissolved" tells the antagonist's interiority with unwarranted certainty rather than staying in Mora's inference. Otherwise, psychic distance is controlled and the prose texture reflects her aesthetic drive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Mira's perceptual signature—her reliance on "texture, form, the weight of shadow" and the sensory explosion when color arrives—is distinct and purposeful. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Theo's "neither kind nor cruel" tone and Mira's "innocently cunning" negotiation voice are differentiated. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she had prepared") appear but don't dull immediacy. The prose texture is controlled, though some constructions ("the kind that couldn't be bought with coin") lean slightly formal for the intimate focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during station listening, wider during ascent and ringing). Perceptual signature—synesthetic color from bell harmonics, grandmother's mining metaphor threading through—is distinct. Diction stays character-bound with mining and acoustic imagery. No dialogue present. One slip: "She began her artificial pilgrimage that morning, though she would not have called it that" is mild head-tilt narrator commentary, but recovers quickly. Compression in the pilgrimage sequence (five stations sketched briskly) serves accumulative rhythm without obscuring focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters setting through Elara's craft expertise ("twisting silver wire around locks of the dead's hair"). Perceptual signature is specific: she sees vacancy in others because she recognizes it. Diction stays controlled—"subdued ardor," "timeless space"—and fits the established voice. The phrase "She had stopped eating, stopped sleeping, stopped answering when clients knocked" uses anaphora purposefully. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's "patient knowledge" risks slight elevation but remains within lexicon. Psychic distance modulates cleanly as pressure shifts from numbness to teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV, stable distance, Vera's perceptual signature is clear (measuring, cataloging, watching for "the crack in the armor"). Dialogue is sparse, functional, and distinct: Marcus's defensive "I don't actually believe in this" versus Vera's calm "I know." The narration employs purposeful compression ("This was data too") and filters appropriately through Vera's analytical lens. Minor slip: "the cards whispering against each other like secrets" edges toward stock phrasing, though the voice recovers quickly. No head-hopping, tense is stable, psychic distance modulates purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira throughout. Perceptual signature shows consistent filtering through her scholarly lens ("old sciences," "equations that could unmake matter"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure needs ("amputation" as metaphor, "atoms of nostalgia" repeated as concept-label). Free indirect style is clean. The prose maintains distinct texture but does not modulate rhythm under the ritual's peak stress, missing an opportunity to tighten at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Vera; psychic distance is controlled and her perceptual signature (noticing shadows, dusk precision) is consistent. Diction is elevated but character-appropriate for an archivist in a speculative setting. The phrase "softly deliberate" recurs as description rather than enacted trait in every instance, and "luminous regret" appears twice as a set phrase, suggesting slight template reliance. Dialogue is minimal (one line to the shadow) and purposeful. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV control is stable; Vera's perceptual signature (noticing starlight on wood, the vial's color shifts, the owl's hoot) is character-specific and tied to her work with fragile creatures. Voice modulates appropriately: measured and reflective in the opening, more tactile and urgent during the repair work, quietly resolved at dawn. Free indirect style is clean ("Such a small thing to carry so much meaning, but meaning, she was learning, did not require size"). Minor density note: a few lines ("the honest bones of what she had built before Marcus's influence had corrupted it") edge toward thematic exposition but remain anchored to the physical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Mira; distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority during decision beats, slight pull-back for Thomas's entrance). Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices plant whispers, coffee rings, root vibrations—details a non-telepathic character would ignore. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (Thomas's "supposed to make you normal" vs. Mira's "the surgery failed" crystallizes their conflict). Minor texture slip: a few lines lean toward stock phrasing ("something like grief," "something like hope") that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—Vera notices architectures of memory, projectionists' ghosts, film as living medium. Diction occasionally tilts elevated ("luminous jungle," "psychic landscape") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") are sparse and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Voice carries a lyric, fairy-tale register—"curtains of green and violet light," "songs that died in throats"—that suits the fantastical premise. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices unspoken words, colors unnamed, melodies unhummed. Minor register drift: phrases like "capacity to dream" and "celestial memory" edge toward abstraction that feels slightly external to the established voice. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose remains distinct and purposeful across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Mira's perceptions (sand pulsing, chest aching, glimpsing the archive). Narrative distance is consistent, using free indirect style that stays close to Mira's lived-in knowledge of the divergent archive without over-explaining. Voice carries a distinct lyric-SF texture ("wave functions bent wrong," "occasionally everywhere," "fractured lullaby") that fits the conceptual world, though some phrases lean toward elevated register ("adjacent to memory," "entities that hummed with potential energy") that risks distancing the reader during quieter beats. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the child's lines ("I fell through. The wave functions bent wrong") match the established idiom. Perceptual signature is present (Mira notices probability fields, frequencies, archive manifestations) but could be more idiosyncratically selective under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "velvet pistons," "footnotes rather than survival," "probable miracles" create a contemplative, lyric register consistent with a philosopher-narrator. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during tree-touch, wider during exposition). The prose texture fits character—philosophical, attentive to metaphor. Minor ding: a few filter verbs ("she could feel," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, and "the hum of insight" phrase recurs without evolving, reading mildly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable and the prose carries a lyric, lullaby-inflected texture consistent with the tone requirement. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geography of her own unlived life," "threshold hour") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Mira's interior lexicon. The guides' dialogue is indistinct—each speaks in the same soothing, aphoristic cadence without individual voice. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Perceptual signature is present but filtered through generalized retrospection rather than character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in close third with Mira; no head-hopping. Her synesthetic perceptual signature (pain as colors, cold as keening note) is character-particular and filters setting consistently. Diction stays within her experience. The bellhop's silence is motivated and his communication through dust/fog feels earned by the constraint. Minor density issue: "seraphically mundane" registers slightly precious for the narrator's idiom, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distant-intimate, matching Mira's eon-spanning perspective. Diction is elevated but consistent ("regally unpretentious," "breath between one celestial arrangement and the next"). Perceptual signature is clear: she notices manuscripts, ink formulas, genealogical records—filters befitting a guardian librarian. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (shorter at discovery beats, longer during reflection). No dialogue, so subtext operates through imagery and action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (Marina notices texture, rhythm, data patterns). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cathedrals of color into bone-white graveyards"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the coordinate-matching revelation. Minor slip: "The coral had screamed in ways only data could translate" edges toward poetic convenience rather than Marina's professional lexicon, and a few phrases ("accumulated weight, the way sediment builds into stone") feel slightly elevated for the moment's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices the thrum of "distant engines that no longer existed," the "silver rain" of starlight, the "cathedral vastness." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though occasional phrases ("thunderous serenity," "mantle of stars") approach elevated register. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the stones' crescendo), compression and imagery remain legible and tied to her revolutionary perspective. One brief filter stack ("she saw that every revolution was…") is acceptable given the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature—moss "spoke to her of mineral deposits," ferns "told her stories"—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction mostly fits an older woman's register ("insurgent grandmother," "breath caught") but occasionally drifts into writerly elevation: "implanted destiny," "photosynthetic whispers" (not on page but implied), "resonant reconfiguration" tone. The vine's "approval curl warmly through her thoughts" at closure is embodied metaphor that works. Free indirect style is clean. One friction: no dialogue on the page to test rhythm or subtext, and some interiority ("she preferred to think of herself as a guardian") reads expository rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the freeze, wider when surveying the coastline). Perceptual signature is strong: Mariam notices stress signals in plants because she reads them in herself. Some diction slips toward clinical register mid-crisis ("somatic markers," "freeze response claiming her nervous system like a hostile country") where embodied sensation would sharpen voice under pressure. The simile "like a hostile country" and "like tide water receding" are vivid but slightly elevated for the moment's urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm varies, though a few template stems appear ("She placed one hand... She counted... She extracted").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eleanor's perceptual signature is consistent: she filters the world through an artist's lens ("amber grief," "luminescent ache"). The rhetorical questions establish a distinct tic that serves isolation and philosophical bent. POV remains stable in limited third; interior access stays character-bound. Some diction elevates beyond immediate urgency ("negotiation between the person someone was and the person they believed themselves to be"), creating minor distance spikes during high-pressure beats, but voice coheres overall.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Seren's perceptual signature: tracker's precision, sensory focus on grooves and patterns, and the time-distortion filter. Diction is mostly controlled—"consciously wild" and "honey-thick seconds" carry distinct texture, though "serene and patient as a glacier" leans elevated for a character in crisis. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between observational calm and intensified perception during the time-stretch beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature filters the Archive through curatorial care ("cataloging the dead-but-dreaming") and moral pressure. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Vance's "Working late" and Mira's "I understand that silence is a choice" carry subtext and advance plot. Diction remains consistent (no register drift). Minor penalty: "bravely conflicted in a way that made her chest ache" edges toward label-speak where embodied contradiction would sharpen, though it does not collapse voice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Mira's perceptual signature (sensing "subtle tremors of emotion in living things") colors description and choice. Diction remains character-bound with purposeful elevation ("engraved quiet," "inculcating plants with values") that feels voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion. Minor slips: "senselessly perceptive" and "tranquil blaze" are named too directly rather than dramatized through perception alone, and a few filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear where immediacy could be tighter under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited through Maren; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct with a measured, patient texture that matches her fisher occupation: "Cool-headed, her mother used to say. Ice where your blood should be." Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("feral beauty of a lullaby sung through clenched teeth"), though some phrases edge toward over-writing ("amber grief, crimson determination, the pale blue of hope"). Dialogue from Vela and Maren is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext. Perception remains character-bound (frequencies "bypassing her ears entirely and settled directly into her bones"). Minor register drift in "voicing silence" feels slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but the overall perceptual signature is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. POV modesty is strong—Margaret infers her father's motives from evidence, not omniscience. Diction is controlled and consistent: "splinter," "burgundy stains," "circuits" and "veins" for cities. Perceptual signature is clear (she notices calculations, star charts, the nib). One line wobbles into slight elevation: "correction fluid for the universe" reads writerly but stays just within bounds. Psychic distance shifts are intentional. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Strong rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistently lyric-literary with a distinct perceptual signature: "time curled back upon itself like smoke remembering flame," "hours sometimes ran backward through her fingers," "sounds the world had forgotten." POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "dissonance of that guilt had haunted Vera's bloodline like corrupted code in ancient machinery" mixes metaphor vehicles (biological bloodline, digital code, mechanical parts) without grounding. Filter verbs ("she understood now," "she didn't know if") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the release. Psychic distance is controlled but leans toward summary during the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("read faces like open books," now "read the sand") but diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "lilac-soft," "spiral logic," "great forgetting that preceded a greater remembering." Dialogue feels purpose-driven and the old man's idiom distinguishes him from Mira's poetic interiority. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression in the hush descriptions is taught early, but several lines ("tegrated into action and thought") edge toward abstraction without concrete anchoring, limiting upward movement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited holds stable focal distance; diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") is voice-motivated and legible within the speculative frame. Perceptual signature: Kira notices broken things, their histories, and the weight of erasure. Psychic distance tightens at peak beats (the fire vision, the carving). Minor: "warm coldness" and "gentle radical" feel slightly imposed rather than emerging from Kira's idiom; the phrase "stubborn human need to remember tenderness" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic statement rather than filtered perception. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (Kira infers Emre's name from a lover's memory, not omniscience).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Madeline; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthesia colors all observation ("crimson and gold," "deep indigo," "pale green and silver"), and diction stays within a theatrical register ("encore-seeking," "curtain call," "crescendo"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at key beats ("The ghost descended, drawn by purpose older than memory"). The woman's unspoken interiority is respected—we see only her visible reactions. Free indirect style is clean. Minor strain: "producing echoes" reads slightly abstract for Madeline's concrete sensory filter, and the phrase "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" edges toward elevated diction that a centuries-old performer might use but risks register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Maya filters all detail through her artist's eye (fractally precise spirals, mica sheets as frozen thought) and skeptical-but-open stance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("affectionate skeptic," "willowglass," "somatic markers") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the chamber discovery. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects her methodical mind under pressure: short declarative beats during discovery, longer lyric cadence in the final painting gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited remains stable; Vera's perceptual signature (thermal sensors, emotional topography, the way she reads landscapes as feelings) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"emotional static," "transitional objects," "factually mystical"—though occasionally elevated beyond strict moment-by-moment interiority. No head-hopping. The piece leans into a meditative, almost ethnographic register that fits Vera's role. Dialogue is absent (appropriate for solitude). Brief elision of the five-year mission is purposeful compression. One filter-verb stack ("began to float," "trying to communicate," "began to speak") in the climactic chamber slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: "methodical patience," professional lens on hourglasses and time. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("unearthed silence," "morning frost," "amber-tinted darkness"). Free indirect style is clean, though occasional filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during discovery, wider during reflection. The prose carries a distinct texture (archaic dignity, careful cadence) that holds under pressure, though the final paragraphs risk losing urgency in favor of lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Margaret; perceptual signature is professional (reading codes, noting melt patterns, preparing extraction plans). Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven—Viktor's plea, Margaret's refusal of forgiveness—and carries subtext in the folder exchange. Diction remains consistent with Margaret's intelligence background. Minor deduction: "silver hush" and "mist breathed" recur enough to approach pattern without full lyric commitment, and Viktor's final speech, while earned, leans slightly toward thematic explication rather than pure character pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly on the coachman; his perceptual signature is distinct (listening over seeing, the gutters as information). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; the passenger's confession and the coachman's replies carry subtext. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful: the opening is tight on his attention, the middle opens slightly for her backstory, the ending returns to tight focus on the exchange. Diction remains within the coachman's grounded register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Serin notices through craft metaphors ("centering clay," "wedge it against warm stone") and sensory specificity ("frequency she felt in her teeth"). Diction remains character-apt; no head-hopping. Minor density variation: "She sat back on her heels and laughed, a sharp sound in the soft silence" modulates well under discovery's pressure, though one or two phrases ("time before the scorching, when green things grew without apology") edge toward elevated register without full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Marina notices "rusted coffee cans," "cracked terracotta," and harbor rhythms through a gardener's lens. Diction is controlled and consistent ("wistfully pragmatic," "erosion of her mother's memory," "small green kingdom"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Narrative certainty matches Marina's knowledge; the stranger remains gaunt and uncertain, not diagnosed. Purposeful elision: the grandfather's death and Marina's divorces are compressed to prime the present without flatline exposition. The prose has rhythmic variety ("That was the philosophy… But tonight, something shifted") and modulates under pressure (trembling hand, held breath). No dialogue present to evaluate. The final image reconfigures prior material with syntactic control: "holding space for everything that grew and everything that ended."

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering all detail through Mira's seven-hundred-year perspective. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices leviathan shadows, ancient stone surfaces, and the frequency of the small creatures' chirps. Diction stays consistent—elevated but not anachronistic ("brittle awakenings," "atomically reflective," "calcified around her heart")—and modulates with emotional intensity at the closure beat. The single line of dialogue ("Time is not a cage...") carries subtext and advances plot by reframing the sundial's purpose. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climactic placement and hatching sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Mira's perceptual signature: she notices the "inkwell balanced on the marble ledge," translates lovers' "inarticulate ache," and registers the "prismatic quiet." Diction remains within her register (scribe, keeper of secrets) with purposeful elevation ("architecture she would never see completed") that fits her profession. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, pulling close for the self-directed letter and widening for the contemplative final paragraph. No dialogue appears; internal voice is consistent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close distance; Mira's perceptual signature (astrophysics lexicon, chart annotations in crimson, subsonic hum "in her teeth, her bones, the liquid of her eyes") is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is minimal and functional (Morrison's panic, the chanting). Register remains controlled, though phrases like "cosmic entities that fed on chaos and division" and "a society tearing itself apart" drift slightly toward exposition. The psychic distance tightens effectively during the broadcast ("The tricksters knew. They were paying attention now"). Voice modulates with intensity without artifice. Minor: a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she heard") could be cut for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct ("shadowed nexus," "prudently adventurous," "negotiate with her fear"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the crawl and opening for reflection. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the moment's urgency ("transfix the very dust motes"), and the phrase "the rebellion of a woman whose own body betrayed her" reads slightly essayistic. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is consistent: Helena notices architectural details and emotional stakes in equal measure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Clara; perceptual signature (counting stones, mapping geometry) is specific and consistent. Diction remains controlled and voice-apt throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. The narrative certainty matches Clara's knowledge cleanly, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct archival-librarian texture ("spongey dread," "sediment in her chest") that modulates under pressure. Dialogue with Torres is functional and advances plot, though his lines lack subtext or resistance that would create indirection. The prose reflects Mira's internal state without filter-verb stacks. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("phenomenon the current scientists had missed entirely") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, and Torres's skepticism-to-belief dialogue feels templated rather than idiomatically distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature clear (Margaret's musician's catalogue of faces, her observational lens). Diction carries a consistent lyric elevation ("luminous disbelief," "scaffold wrap's secret semaphore") that fits the contemplative tone, but the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("radical acceptance," "the architecture of her life") that feels authored rather than inhabited. The hitchhiker's dialogue is minimal and purposeful, though his eyes "reflecting too much sky" borders on stock mysticism. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately with Margaret's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds Elias cleanly across time jumps; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he reads micro-expressions, notes "dissuading travelers from resistance with nothing but presence," filters the caboose through currency and stones. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—"You kept our system" / "It kept people out"—with goal pursuit (father seeking reconciliation, Elias deflecting) and subtext (the real conversation is about staying versus leaving). Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter in the final scene, wider during the startup summary. Free indirect style is clean. Minor weakness: "the strange arithmetic of return" and "beautiful in their impossibility" drift slightly toward authorial register rather than Elias's idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "daylily-pressed telegram," "the mathematics of suffering," "midnight solace" all feel voice-consistent. Diction remains controlled and purposeful throughout, with vocabulary apt for a chronicler-astronomer. However, some passages drift into elevated register that feels slightly external to Mira's present pressure: "nascent light," "tentative songs against the retreating darkness." The penultimate paragraph ("When understanding dawns...") shifts into commentary mode rather than staying inside Mira's perception. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is mostly clean, with minor slips toward narrator intrusion in the philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Maren's perceptual signature is consistent (notices the vortex's appetite, recognizes guilt and relief crystallized together). Distance modulates purposefully: close during the spine-unbending and the confession completion, slightly wider during the vortex crossing. Diction stays character-bound ("druid," "warlike serenity," "flesh-eating plant seed pulsed... eager"); no head-hopping. Minor slip: "The druid had learned long ago to guard herself against hope" leans slightly expository, but anchors present stance. Rhythmic control holds under pressure; the confession moment compresses syntax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct, heightened register ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation," "cobalt glade"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices scars, roots, and dream-geography. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("eclipsed covenant," "cartography of their unconscious travels") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Dialogue is minimal and functional. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout. Rhythm and syntax support the lyric-mystical tone, though the explain-everything penultimate paragraph flattens narrative stance slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited remains stable and controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira "inlaying meaning everywhere," reading skulls as ledgers and roots as choice-stories. Diction stays character-appropriate with occasional lyric elevation ("phosphorescent moss painted," "mineral memory") that suits the mythic setting. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in the Gardener's "not a question" and his tender pruning contrasted with skeletal frame. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; Marcus's perceptual signature (facts as armor, technical vocabulary under stress) remains consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Val's clipped "You're that guy from the video" and Marcus's single-word admissions ("Yes") reveal status and power without exposition. The narrative voice modulates appropriately—compressed and fact-laden when Marcus retreats, more expansive when he risks insight. One minor slip: "confidently uncertain existence" in paragraph three reads slightly authorial rather than Marcus-filtered, a brief register mismatch. Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and the prose rhythm (short declaratives during crisis, longer syntax during reflection) supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elena filters everything through translation metaphor ("A seed was like a cuneiform sign"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent ("kindly methodical," "process later") and modulates under pressure without register drift. The caretaker's brief dialogue feels functional and distinct. Minor slip: "the spirit had left" in the opening feels slightly detached from Elena's immediate grief, but recovers quickly. Purposeful compression in the fruit-tasting beat ("every transition she had ever witnessed flowing through her") fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Mira's professional and philosophical lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "smelt them, using the old archival term," "titan-gear calibrated to the same gravitational pulls." Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; the fisherman's laconic delivery contrasts with Mira's reflective precision. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during interior reflection, pulling back slightly for the fisherman's exchange. One minor register drift: "the impossible persistence of memory" in the final paragraph elevates slightly above the established lexicon. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable, and Elena's perceptual signature is consistent (inspector's eye, emotional guardedness softening into recognition). Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate throughout. The prose modulates well with emotional intensity: clinical inspection language ("radiation meter," "quarterly inspection") gives way to metaphor ("calcification of things left unsaid") as Elena's stakes rise. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The reflection on her marriage is anchored to the present (pearl, shells) and tilts her stance toward action, meeting BRR requirements cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren's perceptual signature—chronicler's precision, metaphors drawn from rivers and maps—is consistent and specific. Psychic distance is controlled; reflection is anchored to concrete cues (accordion, graffiti, broken glass). Diction remains within her register ("daringly methodical," "map references," "raw and unfiltered") with one brief elevation: "allude to melodies half-remembered" feels slightly elevated for internal voice under grief, though not jarring. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Rhythm modulates appropriately, quieting in memory and tightening in the final paragraph. Filter verbs ("seemed to allude") appear sparingly and fit the voice. Overall, the prose carries Maren's mind with minimal static.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a mythic, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical library—"captured fog," "frozen tears"—but diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("cautious exuberance," "measured silence") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue except the protagonist's final two spoken sentences, which read as declarative closure rather than natural speech under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent (filtered through awe and discovery) but lacks the idiosyncratic edge that would distinguish this voice from genre convention. Filter verbs ("She could feel it," "seemed to pulse") appear in key beats, dulling directness.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature: she reads coffee stains, hears ferns, feels ice burn. Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("bruised plums," "green ribbons," "frozen heart"). The ferns' dialogue-substitute ("Propagate") carries purposeful compression. One brief register slip: "the convenient erasure of the mountain people" edges toward essay tone, but the surrounding specificity (ice caverns, glacier carving) grounds the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (professional attentiveness, taught pattern-finding). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the aurora encounter. However, diction elevates during peak beats ("the particular frequency of a soul," "gossamer boundary") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-bound. No head-hopping; the voice is controlled but occasionally slips register under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: "silence here was not empty but full, the way a glass holds wine." Psychic distance is stable throughout. Theron's brief dialogue ("I was going to give it to someone") carries natural hesitation and his fading cognition. The diction occasionally elevates ("umbral," "vineyard hush") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately between reflection and ritual action without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the keeper with clean access to her interiority. Voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("thin as sea glass," "cathedral of wind and glass") that suits the keeper's professional mystique. Dialogue is purposeful and advances the counsel, with the keeper's lines carrying subtext (permission-granting disguised as insight). Minor slips: the keeper's internal phrasing occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("to unhook her clients from the desperate need for clean answers") that reads more like authorial summary than her lived thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but could be more idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Elowen with clean focalization; psychic distance tightens during the demonstration and Vara's trance. Voice is distinct and controlled: "sycamore hush," "backward into the unborn," rhythmic and layered without opacity. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—Vara's patience, Elowen's recognition of her readiness. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction: a few passages edge toward elevated diction ("manifest as presence") that slightly exceeds the grounded tone elsewhere, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Vessa reads the world through sound, echo, and pattern. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("accumulated centuries," "sacred perch") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The traveler's brief dialogue is functional but lacks distinct idiom. Psychic distance compresses appropriately at the closure beat, and the dust-cracking smile provides embodied texture, though much of the piece operates at a reflective distance that mutes urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's way of noticing blends practical detail with lyric sensitivity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mist-walking sequence. The prose carries character-specific texture in word choice and rhythm. Minor slips: "which is why it accommodates dreamers" in the mentor's voice feels slightly didactic, and a few lines ("feeling nothing, which was exactly what she'd felt") use syntactic templates that flatten momentum. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marcus's perceptions throughout; the lamplighter's practical vocabulary and the quiet, deliberate pacing match his character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the vial moment ("impossible pigments bleeding into one another"), wider during the reflective passages about Elena's methods. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Marcus notices light, angles, and atmospheric details through a lamplighter's lens. Minor filter-verb density in the middle third ("he'd found," "she'd hidden," "she'd always done") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the POV or closure effect. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices cosmic signals, coin patterns, stellar behavior through her diviner's lens). Diction remains controlled with purposeful compression ("ambered," "un-becoming," "distill meaning from static") that feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental. The narrative stance modulates appropriately from technical observation to quiet enthusiasm to acceptance. One minor slip: "stellar doubt" and "quietly enthusiastic" occasionally read as authorial labels imposed on interiority rather than emerging from Mira's own thought patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the crystallization sequence. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices "child's wonder and scholar's precision" in Elias's work, filters the dome's light through grief's lens. Diction stays within her register (professional reaper vocabulary, poetic compression). Minor slip: "the strange alchemy of grief and grace" in the penultimate section trends slightly abstract compared to the concrete texture dominant elsewhere, but the phrase remains voice-plausible and doesn't fracture focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: patient, slightly archaic diction ("tepid dishwater," "earnest naivety") mirrors Corin's methodical worldview. POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong—he understands reality in terms of flow, drip, accumulation. The prose modulates appropriately: technical precision during the ritual ("spider silk and morning dew"), warmth at the ending. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no dialogue to evaluate. Syntax varies purposefully and the final sentence's rhythm supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; perceptual signature (levee warden's attention to water levels, structural details) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider valley vista. However, several lines slip into elevated register incongruent with a warden's lexicon: "liminal hour," "violet grip," "ancient earth," "mirrored hush" (repeated). The phrase "precisely humane" at closure reads as authorial intrusion rather than Martha's internal idiom. Voice is strong overall but shows seams under peak emotional pressure where diction should tighten to character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature evident in Elara's dual lens (scientific precision meets mystic receptivity: "not translating but absorbing"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("The sentimental heart she hid") to slightly elevated lyricism at the transformation. Some register drift occurs in abstract peak moments: "the equations of her training interlace with the intuitions she had always trusted secretly" reads more like authorial summary than embodied perception under stress. The prose texture is consistent and voice-motivated, but the transformation beat sacrifices concrete sensation for conceptual language ("felt the touch of wonder move through her like sunrise through water"), which distances the reader at the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (spectral lens, wind gauges, pressure differentials filtered through a watcher's training). Diction remains within Vera's plausible lexicon—technical but not academic, disciplined yet haunted. The radio dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Ash's pauses and Vera's sparse replies. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the revision sequence, pulling back slightly for the six-hour summary. Minor slip: "like a soundless echo, reverberating with implications she could feel but not hear" is a beautiful phrase but slightly over-explains its own effect in a way that drifts toward narrator commentary rather than Vera's percept.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV (Kira) is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she "had learned to see beyond surfaces") but diction occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("emotional depth," "analytical distance"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("Because she'll destroy it" / "Because she'll activate it"), though the exchange tilts toward debate rather than embodied evasion. Filter verbs ("watching," "glimpsed") cluster in reflective beats without harming immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; Victor's perceptual signature (musician's ear, grief-sharpened attention to sound) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "spirits of unlived moments," "macerated against the walls" feel more narrator than grieving father. The phrase "mournfully eager" appears twice in identical form, a template echo. Psychic distance is controlled, and interior reflection anchors in present stimuli (tunnel acoustics, photos). No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maren with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinctive: frost-wild hair, thorn nails, and the way she's "forgotten the sound of crying" mark her feral guardianship. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Maren's "Home is a flexible concept here" and "I want to remember what it feels like to not wait alone" carry subtext and advance plot. Minor slip: a few phrases approach elevated diction ("interiorizing exteriors," "soft domestications") that sit at the edge of Maren's plausible lexicon after seventeen years of near-silence, though they remain voice-motivated and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Maren's alchemical lens filters all description ("vivify," "unknit," "successive approximation"). Diction remains elevated and technical throughout, consistent with her scholarly background. Free indirect style is clean, though occasional phrases ("the old philosophers called it") introduce slight filter distance without disrupting flow. Register is consistent; no unmotivated lexicon shifts. The final paragraph's self-aware summary ("feeling nothing and everything at once") reads as interiority rather than narration, though it edges toward telling emotional state rather than embodying it through micro-gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with narrative certainty matching Mira's knowledge and professional lexicon ("celestial signal interpreter," "amplification cascade"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices corrosion, frequencies, and chemical promises where others would see abandonment. Diction remains controlled—"texture," "shard of hush," "serenely electric"—with purposeful compression in the climax ("what came through was not sound but texture"). Minor register drift: "the willing­ness to hear what others dismissed as noise" in the final section reads slightly instructional rather than fully embodied thought. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Mara's resiliently positive filter colors her narration ("Beautiful evening for a dissolving"). Diction remains consistent and controlled ("spectral grotto," "phosphorescence," "membrane between worlds"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I know what you want"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor: under peak stress (splitting pain), the voice remains composed and articulate without compression or syntactic breakdown, slightly dulling the embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "rational enchantment," "the systematic magic of perception creating what it observed." Diction remains consistent and architecturally precise. One register slip: "the texture of connection humming through every thread" uses "texture" literally and metaphorically in close succession, creating minor strain. Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying tight to Marina's perception. No dialogue to evaluate. The final paragraph's explanatory tone ("unaware that Marina had negotiated peace") slightly softens the prior control.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Vara; psychic distance modulates purposefully when she glimpses edge geometry ("not just stars, but relationships"). Diction stays within Vara's military-instructor lexicon elevated by wonder ("cathedral of shadows," "impossible architecture"). Tessek's translated dialogue carries alien cadence without caricature. Dialogue advances goals (teaching, realization) and carries subtext. Minor: one filter-verb cluster in paragraph four ("thought of," "felt like") slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains distinct and the final image is rhythmically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Vera; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the atrium encounter, wider in the opening setup). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "reeling into something sacred," "the dead call when grief reaches its breaking point." Margaret's dialogue ("They said you could help") carries naturalism and goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("Vera felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. One register slip: "electromagnetic echoes of the hearts that depended on them" reads slightly expository for Vera's lived interiority. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Vera's knowledge except for the assured claim that Ruth "went peacefully," which Vera infers but presents as fact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with clear perceptual signature: Mira's professional lens (coordinates, sensors, electromagnetic ghosts) blends with emotional specificity ("strange in the flooded chamber"). The single dialogue line ("Dr. Samuel Chen…I see you") serves witness rather than conversation and carries subtext. Diction stays consistent under pressure; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. The phrase "crashing hush" recurs purposefully (opening "tidal change and then nothing but silence," closing "ocean crashed its endless hush") and modulates tone without head-hopping. Minor slip: "their stories surfacing from the deep" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, but the line stays anchored in Mira's mission.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: the heartbeat-counting habit, the way Mira reads patterns in ink, the solitary ritual design. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent. However, some lines drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted: "communion with her own scattered self," "defragment her ghost," and "archived griefs and abandoned hopes flowing back" read more lyric-essay than lived interiority. The prose serves the piece's contemplative mode but occasionally abstracts where concrete sensation would anchor harder.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance is controlled. The protagonist's perceptual signature (texture-to-sound translator) is distinct and consistent. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction is purposeful ("frozen screams," "tunnel of echoes"). Two slips: "quietly articulate voice" is told rather than shown through speech or cadence, and at peak intensity ("Through the patterns in the flock of birds in flight, the forgotten words began to return") the register smooths into summary rather than embodying her vocal struggle. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Maren's perceptual signature (scientist seeking patterns, reverent care with artifacts) shapes what she notices. Narrative distance is consistent, diction remains within her lexicon (no filter-verb stacks, no unmotivated register shifts). The phone dialogue—Samuel's fragmented confession—carries subtext and advances plot by revealing the metamorphosis. Voice modulates effectively from measured observation to charged realization ("She understood then"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the discovery beat. No head-hopping, no POV leakage; the prose texture fits the character's stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinctive and lyric, with controlled rhythm ("That softness had kept her alive") and a perceptual signature (peripheral glances, dust patterns, the way sound is cataloged). Psychic distance remains stable; interiority is filtered through Mira's musicianship and heightened awareness. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (shorter syntax when the statue climbs). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she had learned," "she had wept") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-consistent. The final line's syntactic shift ("one heartbeat at a time") integrates rhythm with theme without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature—mapping absences, noticing gaps—is character-specific. Dialogue (four brief exchanges) feels natural and advances plot through subtext ("You don't," he said gently). However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("perpetual twilight," "cosmic ledger," "brittle hush") in ways that feel writerly rather than character-filtered. The phrase "respectfully rebellious in his methods" reads as external assessment rather than Marcus's idiom. Rhythmic control under pressure is solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, image-dense voice that matches Marcus's carpenter background ("dust rising like incense," "temporal pocket"). Diction remains consistent except for occasional elevated phrasing ("sacred geometry of incomplete things") that hovers at the edge of the character's plausible lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative compression—seventeen years of silence, discovery, resolution—is purposeful and taught early. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's summary of future action ("He would stay… would repair… would practice") shifts into distant telling when a grounded final image would sharpen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Eleanor notices what a cataloger would (shelf curves, patron positions, archive formats). The prose modulates appropriately—compressed syntax during the geometry shift, richer description in the impossible room. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The phrase "her grandmother's hands that she had inherited along with the library" drifts toward lyric overreach, but the voice remains coherent and the scarf's sensory anchoring (oil, lavender, warmth) keeps interiority concrete. Purposeful compression in the final room is legible and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third limited throughout; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the roof scenes, slightly wider in the framing paragraphs). Perceptual signature: "The dream kept running" and "The luminous absence of her grew heavier than presence ever had" show character-specific processing. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("vitalize the fading images," "frequencies invisible to ordinary sight") but remains within a literary librarian's register. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the fog breakthrough. No dialogue to evaluate. The epilogue's shift to present tense ("still keeps her post") is intentional but slightly disrupts established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira. Perceptual signature is present: "water enigmatic," locksmith's hands understanding shapes, focus on ribbon texture under pressure. Diction modulates with emotional intensity ("unassumingly bold," "improbable longing"). Minor slips: "enigmatic in the way that water is enigmatic—transparent yet unfathomable" is a stock construction, and filter verbs ("she had heard," "she withdrew," "she understood") cluster in exposition. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Overall voice is consistent and purposeful, with compression that fits the lyric-accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable (close third, Elara's focalization) with perceptual signature anchored in her folklorist training: she reads glass cracks as star charts, names constellations (Hunter, Ship, Weeping Woman), sees fairy rings as markers. Diction remains consistent ("chronically curious," "broken constellations," "the hungry forgetting that stalked their family line") with purposeful elevation that suits her scholarly idiom. No head-hopping. The grandmother's voice is recalled in free indirect style ("When you forget me, and you will, come back here when the sea goes away") without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Mira's perceptual signature (noticing dust, shadows, mirror-dust) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Mira and Thessaly carries subtext and advances the decision without feeling expository. However, some interiority edges toward over-articulation—"It sounds like combat" and the explicit "armor" versus "comfort" framing—reducing the trust in image and implication. Filter verbs ("felt her throat tighten," "watched her finish") are present but not excessive. The prose modulates well under pressure, though a few beats lean on scaffolding ("She thought of the timeframe...") that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited with access to Marek's understanding and memory. The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("insatiably creative," "verdant parapet," "hush of budding hope") that fits the fable-like tone without becoming purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marek notices color, light, essence, the logic of pruning. Some passages ("weaving between the dying colors and the promise of new growth") verge on abstract diction but remain coherent within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance contracts appropriately when she threads the needle and loosens knots. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "ground restless spirits" reads as her professional self-concept, and "economy of confessed guilt" reflects her restorer's lens. Callum's dialogue ("You came") is spare and ghostly, distinct from Mira's interior texture. One minor register wobble: "lucid unrest" and "interlaced hush" occasionally read slightly elevated for her immediate perception under pressure, though they remain within the poetic frame the piece establishes early.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct ("methodically curious by nature, the kind of person who took notes on her notes"). Diction matches Elena's professional lens: "map framer by trade," "blank spaces revealed as much as the detailed ones," "shielded openness." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during video comparison and relaxing for context. No head-hopping. Some figurative language edges toward elevated register ("patient as prayer," "erosion of painted prayers") but remains voice-motivated and legible. One mild filter-verb cluster ("seemed to shift," "seemed to turn") in mid-passage but does not dull immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: Eleanor's scientific precision ("approach quietly analytic") colors her observations without flattening emotion. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively from clinical observation to lyric intensity at closure. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster in the final third ("The world kept turning despite the weight…") and slight register drift into abstract philosophy ("matter released energy when bonds broke") that, while character-appropriate, edges toward exposition. Dialogue is absent; internal voice remains consistent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices the bolt plate's weight, mist patterns, and the ghost's pixel-like condensation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during song, wider during the ghost's dissolution). The phrase "driftingly alert awareness" is voice-consistent and recurring. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I understand now"). Filter verbs ("watching how it caught," "feeling its weight") fit the contemplative texture. Some elevated diction ("luminous," "liminal") edges toward lyric register but remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and closely aligned with Mira's perceptions throughout. Narrative distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority when reading diary entries, wider lens when describing the ascent and observatory). Psychic distance and filter use are controlled; diction stays consistent with Mira's educated-servant register. The single line of dialogue—"My lady, I believe these memories are ready to come home"—carries subtext (gentle authority, inherited mission) and advances the plot. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the voice is clean and the prose rhythm supports emotional beats without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with psychic distance modulating purposefully between Elena's technical observations and grief-saturated interiority. Perceptual signature is distinct: a meteorologist's eye filtered through loss, yielding phrases like "Cirrus melancholicus" and "quietly explosive." Diction stays within her lexicon—scientific terminology merged with emotional precision. The prose rhythm shifts between clinical notation and lyric meditation without losing coherence. One minor slip: "spooled with wholeness" in the middle reads slightly authorial rather than character-voiced, but recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices texture, temperature, geometry—and diction ("fractally precise," "landscapes of texture," "infinite geometries") suits her artist's sensibility. Psychic distance is consistent. One brief elision (the scholars' backstory, the guild's condemnation) is efficiently compressed and does not withhold facts Elara knows. Minor repetition in sentence stems ("She drew the way bark feels…She drew blindness as a gift…") creates a deliberate cadence but edges toward template rhythm in the crafting passage.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays clean; Elara's perceptual signature (map-reader noting coastlines and details, narrating to absent crew) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction matches her apprentice role: technical terms (coordinates, latitude, cipher) integrate naturally. The talking-to-herself device ("She talked to herself constantly now") anchors her isolation without filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately—closer during discovery beats, pulling back for the captain's return. Minor slip: "stranded as in beached, settled, waiting to be found" reads slightly over-articulate for real-time realization under excitement, nudging toward helpful narrator, but recovers quickly into action. Psychic distance and narrative stance remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Mira throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully between her sensory experience and reflection. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("the silence pressed against her ears," "cold grew teeth") that suits the fantastical premise. Diction occasionally reaches for elevated register ("hauntingly bright," "driftwood nostalgia wrapped around her heart") that fits the mythic tone but sometimes edges toward overwrought. The mentor's dialogue fragment ("Every broken thing wants to be whole") reads naturally and advances both character and theme. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV through Elara is stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "fog drifted like breath," "moths descended like living stardust." Dialogue is sparse but functional when present (Marcus's grunt, brief exchange). Minor texture issue: elevated diction ("altruism was not performance but penance," "orchestrates their efforts without commanding") occasionally drifts above Elara's established register during reflective beats, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vouchsafe," "liminal," "hush of time's final ripple"), matching the mythic-philosophical register appropriate to a cosmic sentinel. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (the puppet head, the clock's hands). However, perceptual signature lacks idiosyncratic bias—Mira's way of noticing reads poetic-omniscient rather than character-particular. The prose occasionally drifts into authorial summary: "She understood now why the role required…" explains the premise rather than letting action reveal it. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "offhandedly exact precision," "graceless beauty, all sharp angles and honest ugliness" carry Maren's pragmatic, unsentimental perspective. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the rescue, pulling back slightly for the final image. Dialogue is sparse, functional, goal-driven ("Stay where you are. The frost comes soon."). Diction stays consistent with the focalizer's practical idiom. The prose rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings shift, and no filter-verb stacks or template cadence appear.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narration maintains stable third-person limited throughout with a distinct scientific-contemplative register: "molecules that had touched still resonating with that contact," "polymer chains she designed linked and released." Psychic distance modulates appropriately between the ravine reflection and lab precision. The prose occasionally drifts into workshop idiom ("symphonically minded," "divergent path," "generative") that reads more crafted than character-specific, but the overall texture remains coherent and the perceptual filter—noticing molecular patterns in natural phenomena—is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: the prose carries Vera's vendor-artist hybridity through diction like "mindfully scattered" and "channels where ink or light or thought could flow." POV remains stable in third-limited with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the moonlight ritual, pulling back for conceptual reflection ("rehabilitation measured by the quality of what you offered"). Minor register drift: "quantified absence calculated by what you no longer took" and "pristine moment when a narrative first draws breath" edge into elevated abstraction that feels slightly outside a former forger's lexicon under pressure, though recovery is swift. The child remains externally observed without interiority breach.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited holds steady with Elara's perceptual signature (taste-driven, chef's lexicon, texture-focused). "Sturdy brittle" light and "weeping moisture" reflect her sensory priorities. Cassius's dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("You'll need to analyze..."). Minor register drift: "subsume her remorse" and "compassion their suffering had built" elevate diction slightly above the embodied voice dominant elsewhere, though not enough to break focalization. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though occasionally elevated ("vigorous, purposeful strokes" and "empathetically decisive nature" feel like external labels rather than POV-filtered perception). The narration stays within Elena's knowledge and the perceptual signature—listening, cataloging frequencies—is character-specific. Minor register drift occurs when interiority becomes expository rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is lyric and distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in Vera's "helix-minded" consciousness and her sensitivity to patterns. Free indirect style is mostly clean, and diction choices like "calcified memories," "chaotically precise," and "quaking reverie" create texture. However, elevated register persists uniformly across emotional peaks without modulation ("aspirations in her modified neural architecture"), and several phrases veer into abstraction that dulls immediacy. Psychic distance remains stable, but the voice occasionally reads as writerly rather than character-specific, especially in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clean psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara reads "spaces between" and sees "fractured angles," filtering all sensory detail through her prism-minded lens. Diction stays within her scholarly, contemplative register ("clandestinely luminous," "threshold effects," "serpentine grotto") without jarring shifts. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs appear purposefully. Narrative certainty matches what she can know; the ceiling revelation is tied to her unique perception under inversion. Minor density note: a few phrases ("that restless fire of curiosity and purpose") lean slightly abstract, but voice remains character-particular and rhythm modulates appropriately with the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable and controlled; the tree-song sculptor's perceptual signature (measuring time by creature unfoldings, reading stress cracks as story) is distinct and consistent. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (the sculpture, the porcelain insulator) and tilts her choices. Diction stays within her idiom ("the slow creaking of growth rings expanding") without register drift. The brief "empathy in motion" meta-phrase in the penultimate section is a minor slip, but the sentence immediately returns to embodied action (the hedgehog feeling vibrations).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Helena's chess-tutor lens filters the nexus through strategic vocabulary ("correlating," "translating," "variations") and the basalt stone's dent is noticed with tactile specificity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider reflection. Minor slips: some filter verbs ("She could feel," "She had been thoughtfully precise") dull immediacy, and the phrase "translating silence into understanding" recurs without fresh embodiment. Diction remains within Helena's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and lyric—"intuitively descriptive" diction matches Vera's cataloging project—but some lines drift into elevated abstraction: "imagination, she had learned, was simply reality wearing a different costume." Psychic distance is stable (close third) with no head-hopping. The phrase "theatrical sincerity" in the rubric is dramatized when Vera speaks aloud to darkness, though "With theatrical sincerity" as a filter tag is clunky. Perceptual signature is present (she hears "colors only the heart could see"), but under peak pressure the prose becomes more generic: "weeping with something that felt remarkably like joy" hedges rather than specifies. No dialogue to evaluate. The final paragraphs lose rhythmic control, lengthening into summary cadence that flattens the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: olfactory cataloging ("resin from the walkway bindings, smoke from morning fires") and the burden/gift framing. Diction is controlled—"bark-rough hands," "wildflower hush," "heavy as a promise." Dialogue is spare but purposeful: Thessaly's lines carry subtext and village philosophy. Free indirect thought is clean. The prose reflects Mira's herbalist mind. Filter verbs (e.g., "understood," "recognized") appear but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Maren's perceptual signature—tracing underground rivers, reading energy in soil—is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("whirling silence," "accumulated intention") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-motivated. The phrase "knowledge that would save her orchards" in the penultimate paragraph leans expository. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices wind patterns, structural details, and danger signs others miss. Diction remains consistent and professional without becoming clinical. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during her readings and memory of her father. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. The prose reflects her methodical mind: "She sketched the flows in her notebook with hazy precision, capturing the approximate boundaries of danger zones while acknowledging that the system changed nightly." Voice modulates with pressure, tightening during the measurements and opening slightly in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in synesthetic detail ("green hummed a deep bass note, violet whispered in soprano ranges"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("oscillating repose," "unfetter") that feels slightly external to the established voice, though the effect is purposeful and mostly legible. The narrative stance modulates with emotional intensity at the climax. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm supports the atmosphere without major slips.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Mira's perception. The prose carries a distinct texture: "avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush," "smoke and whisper," lexicon that reads character-specific and maintains elevated diction without slipping into corporate register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the oath-breaking moment, slightly wider during the vision). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The perceptual signature—attention to acoustic void, memory encoded in bone, tactile relation to driftwood and bronze—remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; diction carries a consistent mathematical-poetic idiom ("time's cruel asymptote," "truth sometimes emerged sideways"). Perceptual signature is strong: Mira notices via geometry and equations. Two minor slips: "the peculiar joy of being understood" in the printed text reads slightly diagnostic for a letterpress output, and "lucid turbulence" in the final paragraph veers toward meta-label. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-appropriate and don't dull immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable focalization. Diction is elevated and lyric ("vertebra illuminated by curtains," "permeable boundary between wonder and reality"), consistent with a quasi-mythic register. However, some constructions feel over-processed: "She had been a courier for eleven years now" front-loads backstory; "What had been a simple delivery was becoming a pilgrimage" tells the thematic shift rather than showing it through action. The perceptual signature (aurora-light catching the pendant, her perpetual trembling) is specific, but reflection dominates over embodied scene work, flattening immediate voice texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (scientific precision meeting mystical acceptance). Diction matches Elara's voice: "romantic nonsense could still be true," "emotional archaeology." The whispered line to mist fits the character's solitary ritual. However, some phrasing trends toward elevated register that slightly distances the reader: "shifted hush," "sound had merely stepped into another room." Internal texture remains coherent under emotional pressure, and no head-hopping occurs. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains close to Mei throughout. Voice is distinct with a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the mystical subject: "raveling silence," "threads of silence," "stoically sparkling." Perceptual signature is consistent—Mei notices threads, light, and weaving patterns. No head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively from reflective backstory to ritual enactment. Minor register drift: "latent sacrifice had always been there, waiting in her bloodline" reads slightly expository in a high-pressure beat. Grandmother's dialogue ("A message can cross any distance…") feels archaic-wise rather than naturalistic, but the effect is coherent within the piece's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with appropriate psychic distance; no head-hopping. Narrative voice carries a measured, slightly elevated register ("gravity-defying stone arches," "made of crystallized sap and ancient memory") that fits the contemplative tone. Dialogue between Oren and the woman feels purposeful and advances the bargain, though the woman's speech ("between understanding and confusion, when the heart knows what the mind hasn't grasped") tilts toward abstraction. Perceptual signature is present but thin: Oren's focus on tactile detail (calloused fingers, tested handholds) is consistent but not deeply character-particular. Free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices texture, layered footsteps, pressure points). Psychic distance is controlled and voice modulates appropriately under stress. The dialogue in the vision beat is functional and goal-driven, revealing the conflict without on-the-nose exposition. Minor slip: "cyclically spontaneous" feels like a prompt label inserted without dramatized constraint, and some interiority edges toward explanation ("she realized") rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited is stable; perceptual signature (cataloging every change, warmly observant) is consistent. Diction matches a reticent skipper's idiom; her single line of dialogue feels weighted and earned. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought") are voice-motivated and minimal. Deduction: "luminescent weight of strangers' gratitude" and "ache of carrying light you cannot keep" in her added letter push toward elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds her established register; the prose at peak moments is more ornate than her prior silence suggests, though the effect serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-close; the Herald's perceptual signature (storms as alive, shadows as partners, laughter as thunder) is distinct and consistent. Diction ("symphony of thunder and joy," "shadowed elation," "co-conspirators in a destiny") is elevated and voice-motivated, fitting the quasi-mythic register. However, several filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she could feel the weather systems gathering," "she felt the familiar shadowed elation"), slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose texture reflects the Herald's reverent, ritualistic stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Senna throughout. Narrative distance is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct meditative texture ("drifted through morning clouds," "fractured through crystalline formations"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the dye master's lines advance plot and the tea-pouring ceremony adds embodied rhythm. Minor voice slips: "quietly explosive" as a label appears twice without full dramatization, and the morpho wing "pulsing with iridescent caution" reads as authorial metaphor rather than Senna's embodied perception. Under pressure (confession beat), voice holds without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Maren's perception filter consistent: she notices grief-weight, tree particulars, brass mechanisms. Diction stays grounded except "collective unconscious of the ancient grove," which briefly drifts into analytical register mid-crisis. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during assembly, breathes at dawn). No head-hopping. The "whispered back" moment borders on attributing tree agency but reads as filtered through the sextant's vibration, preserving POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (memory fragments, song-as-anchor). Diction remains consistent and purposeful, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. One register slip: "nascent light" and "distributed consciousness" drift slightly elevated for a character described as scattered; the rest of the lexicon is grounded. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual filtering through Miriam's grief and self-recrimination. Dialogue feels natural and purposeful ("You're searching for something" / "Everyone receives it eventually"). The librarian's voice is distinct in tone and cadence. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought") are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor register drift into philosophical abstraction ("nestled paradoxes—truths that contradict yet coexist") at peak moments prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: selective, lyrical, with a contemplative rhythm that modulates appropriately ("heuristically gentle," "guerrilla gardening," "tenuous absolution"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear—Mei notices "things that crept" and gradual erasures—and shapes the narrative texture. The phrase "heuristically gentle approach" briefly elevates diction beyond immediate crisis register, but the voice recovers quickly and the choice reads voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between interiority and external observation, and the final paragraph's rhythm charges the closure without slipping into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable, third-limited with clean focalization through Elara's perceptual signature (her archivist's precision, her measurement-driven thinking). Diction matches her role without slipping into generic register. The prose carries a distinct texture—quartz imagery, crystalline metaphors—that remains voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the choice, wider during dissolution). Minor issue: "gently meticulous" appears as author assertion rather than demonstrated through varied syntactic choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature tied to Eliza's smuggler heritage and tactile focus on the watch fob. Diction remains consistent—"salt-thick darkness," "acoustic amber"—and the prose modulates with pressure during the interception beat. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the eel-seller's line carries subtext without clutter. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" appears as narratorial commentary rather than dramatized trait, and the final paragraph's "her father's ghost was finally proud" leans toward telling the emotional payoff rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-close on Vera with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic taste (copper, ozone, seawater, cinnamon, mint, petrichor) and the emergent compass. Diction is elevated and lyric ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "climate had grown so unstable it needed human anchors"), consistent with the futuristic-nostalgia tone. Brief dialogue from the three weather-carriers is functional but interchangeable in register. Under peak pressure (the brother reveal, Vera's recognition), the prose maintains its metaphoric density without compression or embodied breakdown, which softens urgency. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance holds, but the heightened register throughout reduces the contrast needed to charge the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Maren's perceptual signature—geological precision, mnemonic detail—is consistent. Diction mostly fits her voice, though "auroral light blessing this moment of uncorked creativity" drifts slightly elevated in register for someone thinking under emotional duress. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tighter during the drawing, broader in the opening frame).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is clean and stable, with no head-hopping. Diction and syntax create a distinct texture—"wilted near dishonesty the way plants wilted without water" and "a cathedral of magnetic tape" carry voice-specific perception. The phrase "our daughter will always seek truth" in the father's recording introduces a second voice, but it remains brief and contextually bound. Line-level control is strong in descriptive passages, though some interiority ("understanding finally") tells rather than shows. Psychic distance remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and elevated with consistent diction ("calcified into ritual," "borrowed from another world entirely") and strong perceptual signature filtering setting through Maren's craft. POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Two frictions: elevated register occasionally outpaces scene pressure ("truths too large for language," "symphony of truth") in beats that warrant more concrete anchoring, and some figurative density ("copper threads through mountain quartz," "finger pointing toward truths") decorates without tightening momentum. Psychic distance is controlled, and the final paragraph modulates appropriately to closing reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited with tight, consistent focalization through VERA-7's synthetic perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: "circuits like a migraine," "the universe clearing its throat," "chaos...calcified into something immovable." Diction stays character-bound (technical terms like "miniaturize protocol" and "compression field" fit her operational frame). No head-hopping. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from close ("felt it in her circuits") to slightly elevated at closure without breaking stance. Rhythm varies under pressure: the burning sequence tightens ("The box caught. Paper curled and blackened."), the final paragraph breathes. Minor: "strangely organic" repeats twice and "fragmented wholeness" borders on writerly intrusion but reads as thematic intent rather than voice leak.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited through Maren; POV distance is stable and perceptual signature is controlled ("She rejected donations that carried no story," "heard something else beneath the words"). Dialogue feels purposeful and advances plot, though Mrs. Okonkwo's lines ("You want to hear about Delphine") occasionally veer into convenient exposition. The phrase "She came to the courtyard each morning because this was where the old women gathered" reads as summary telling rather than dramatized habit. Register remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marina with a distinct perceptual signature: she processes through "gesture and rhythm," notices cipher patterns, and filters the lab through a cryptographer's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("patient work of wearing down the world"). However, occasional elevated phrasing—"liberate information," "calm defiance"—drifts above Marina's immediate register during high-focus beats. No dialogue is present (correctly not penalized). Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mira notices brine-thick air, calloused hands, the hollow ache of missing memories, and reads coffee grounds through her mother's divination books. Diction remains consistent (sea-glass, salt chamber, sphere's luminescence) and modulates under pressure without register drift. No head-hopping. The prose carries distinct texture in rhythm and word choice ("silence gleamed, thick and crystalline"). Minor slip: the phrase "fluctuated mysteriously" and "silence gleamed" repeat as descriptors rather than evolving through Mira's changing perception, creating slight template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with Mira's contemplative craft. Perceptual signature is present in phrases like "the sensation was terrestrially cosmic" and the attention to silence as texture. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "fierce and peaceful simultaneously") that labels states rather than grounding them in embodied perception. Under peak ritual pressure, the voice does not compress or modulate; it maintains a uniform meditative register that flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated but not overwrought ("like heirlooms, like secrets, like the borrowed sweetness"), with consistent metaphoric texture tied to architecture and archaeology. POV distance is stable; the retrospective first-person allows reflection without breaking present-scene pressure. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Everyone starts with sugar"). Professor Voss's speech has a slightly more formal cadence than the narrator's internal voice, maintaining distinction. Minor slip: "mysterious familiarity she wore like a second face" edges toward precious phrasing in an otherwise grounded passage.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable, clean third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is evident: Mirabel notices tragic radiance, velvet textures, resonance frequencies—details filtered through her grief and technical understanding. Diction remains character-appropriate, though "tragic radiance" and "ghostly resolve" veer toward elevated register at peak moments without quite breaking immersion. Dialogue is minimal (shell whispers, Elena's final question), functional, and distinct. Free indirect style is smooth. The opening and closing images are purposefully charged. Minor filter-verb stacking ("She had been," "she had discovered," "she had learned") in early paragraphs slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("pale luminescence," "calibrated treason," "calcified around his heart") that fits the contemplative, historical tone. However, the diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("the faint scent of heritage roses that no one would ever explain") and the final paragraph's summary mode ("allowed himself, finally, to forgive") softens the immediacy. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is consistent—Veren notices script, ink, and ritual—but the voice does not modulate under peak pressure; it maintains the same measured cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and mythic-lyric, appropriate to the canyon-singer frame ("serpentine nexus," "phosphorescent moss," "universe hummed its secret song"). The voice modulates under pressure—early curiosity gives way to accelerating dread as revelations accumulate. However, some passages drift toward exposition that paraphrases what the reader has just inferred ("They were not blessed or cursed. They were being harvested"), which flattens immediacy slightly. No dialogue on the page, so those bullets are N/A. The perceptual signature (hearing "layered harmonies of intention") is consistent but could be more embodied in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-close on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—"psychic residue," "dreams came to her like photographs," "calcified into silence"—mixing the occupational (wreck-diver ghost whisperer idiom) with lyric compression. Distance control is clean, though some elevated diction ("threshold of consciousness," "windows she could peer through") trends slightly formal for crisis interiority. No dialogue on the page. The phrase "Mira weaves truth carefully" momentarily breaks into present tense and meta-commentary ("knowing that exposure demanded precision") in a way that feels like prompt-echo rather than scene pressure, but the lapse is brief and does not recur. Rhythm modulates well from meditative setup to charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance with strong perceptual signature—Mirelle notices patterns, rhythms, and mathematics where others see randomness. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("scintillatingly somber," "infinitesimal lanterns"), and the prose modulates appropriately from technical observation to emotional weight. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "universe's tendency toward both entropy and elegant repair" which reads slightly elevated for moment-to-moment narration, and the voice occasionally tips toward essay-like meditation rather than immediate experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and Maya's perceptual signature—"sharply observant eyes catching the matching torn edges"—grounds her professional identity. Diction stays consistent with her investigative focus ("intuit the shape of the larger conspiracy"), and the prose modulates appropriately between technical observation and emotional weight. However, some phrases drift into elevated register that feels slightly external: "grotesque abundance," "inexplicable windbreak," and the closing "humanity's future was controlled by those who hoarded salvation" reads more essayistic than character-specific. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV control is stable and Miriam's perceptual signature is distinct: she filters world-as-signal, reads weather as indifferent texture, notices electromagnetic patterns over human warmth. Diction stays consistent with her isolated, technical expertise ("variant allegiance," "electromagnetic radiation," "lyrically prophetic"). Dialogue serves subtext well—Caro's "your word shapes belief" advances her goal while revealing the burden Miriam resists. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "gritty whimsy" appears as label in narration without full embodiment through rhythm or word choice in that moment; the phrase feels slightly authorial rather than Miriam's natural idiom. Under peak stress (Caro's request), syntax tightens appropriately without voice collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled with elevated diction appropriate to a poet narrator ("feral loft," "patient architecture of storms," "lonesome splendor"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is character-specific (noticing sounds, scents, the "ache of beauty"). Some phrases edge toward writerly performance ("positively wistful," "confession of a dying fisherman") but remain voice-coherent. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Vera's perceptual signature is consistent: analytical yet feeling ("logically emotional" filters her processing of grief and duty). Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the vibrational matching sequence. Voice texture is present in specific word choices ("fleshly ethereal," "synchronized with the artifact's dormant energy"). However, some diction feels slightly elevated beyond the moment's urgency—"requisite," "vibrational matching," "molecular level"—creating minor register drift during peak stress. No head-hopping, and the prose rhythm supports the escalating pressure, though a few filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") could be tightened in high-intensity beats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mira's perceptual priorities: celestial arcs, magnetic forces, the restless patience of stone. Diction is elevated and lyric ("leviathan," "inverted sky," "sculpt patience from impatience") but consistent with a contemplative, educated mapper. No dialogue to assess. Some filter verbs ("understood," "knew") appear but do not dull immediacy. Voice modulates subtly from urgent memory (brother's death) to calm resolve (final descent), matching emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent focalization through Margaret. The investigative idiom ("empirical observation," "systematic arcs," "methodical precision") establishes professional voice effectively. Moments like "history pressed against the present like a bruise" show controlled metaphoric reach. However, phrases like "fortified vulnerability" and the therapy-speak framing of her psychological phenomenon create register drift. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction across characters cannot be assessed. Under pressure, the internal texture stays consistent though occasionally drifts toward explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("penitentiary chaplain," "magnifying spectacles," "commissary supplies"). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Ruth's "Come back in a week" and request for something with weight are goal-driven. The perceptual signature is character-specific (Marcus notices moral weight, Ruth notices mechanical precision). Minor register drift in "sounded like morning light breaking through storm clouds after rain" feels slightly elevated for Marcus's internal voice under stress, though it tracks with his chaplain role.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: mechanical metaphors, algorithmic language, and irreverent wit. Zephyr's voice is consistent ("magnificent nonsense," "tediously unimaginative"). The Boiler's dialogue differentiates through brevity and steam-centric diction. Compression is purposeful ("transliterate visual patterns") and legible. Minor filter-verb presence ("detected," "intended") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure at the launch.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Helena with controlled distance. Voice carries distinct texture in phrases like "brightly attentive to patterns" and "mechanical ghosts," though some constructions drift toward corporate register ("consolidated, studied") without clear character motivation. The narrative occasionally over-explains what has been shown: "She would find Marcus Chen, or she would find what remained of him" restates the obvious closure stakes. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between archival work and rising urgency, and no unmotivated head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kira with a distinct perceptual signature: "calmly intuitive sense," salt spray, shadows that "clung... as though alive." Diction stays within character ("glimpses," "splinter she couldn't remove"). The keeper's dialogue "You're the anomaly they whisper about" and his revelatory speech maintain clarity without head-hopping. Minor elevation: "nodded during the weighted breath before reply, letting the silence hold its own meaning" shows purposeful modulation. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Maren's altered perception. Diction is controlled and carries a distinct lyric register ("colors bleeding at their edges," "vast space between intentions"). No head-hopping. Captain Elise's single line of dialogue feels purpose-driven and advances Maren's understanding. Minor: some figurative constructions ("fold in patience," "windborne solace") recur as labels rather than being dramatized through fresh perception under pressure, slightly flattening the perceptual signature at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited through Marcus; distance modulates purposefully (close during the fragment exchange, wider for vineyard description). Perceptual signature is consistent: Marcus filters setting through loss and waiting (buses "winking out," vines as "arthritic hands"). Dialogue carries subtext—Sofia's "I want to understand" masks her search for absolution, Marcus's "destined mismatches" indirection avoids naming Elena. Voice is distinct (lyric-philosophical, weighted with patience) and syntax reflects his contemplative rhythm. Minor slip: Sofia's dialogue occasionally shares Marcus's cadence ("Perhaps that was the point") where sharper contrast would help.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the line walker; perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, sensing edges) is distinct. Narrative distance is consistent, and diction stays within an elevated but character-appropriate register. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the keeper's lines carry subtext (grief, hope), though the prophet's exchange feels slightly generic ("You walk lines that should not be crossed"). Filter verbs ("extending her peripheral awareness," "understood") appear but do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or tense breaks. Minor template cadence in expository beats ("This was why she had come," "This was her gift") slightly flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited to Maren holds throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("perceptively calm," "silver and shadow," "dove gray"). The prose carries a distinct texture, though some phrases ("purple persistence against industrial gray") tilt slightly ornamental. Dialogue is minimal (Viktor's weeping, Mrs. Castellan's request) but purposeful. Under peak stress (the anniversary gathering), the voice remains stable without compression artifacts. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices arcs, gestures, connections.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Elara's scholarly perspective. Perceptual signature is evident in diction like "sonically reflective," "acoustic transformations," and "growth rings...in her botanical studies," and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately from meditative opening to the charged final whisper. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated exposition ("This was why she had refused evacuation when the others abandoned the old institutions for the digital havens") that reads more authored than lived. Free indirect style is generally clean, though a few filter verbs ("she realized," "she thought") could be more immediate. The final "Begin" and the crystal's response land with rhythmic control, and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV distance is stable and apt; Marcus's perceptual signature is distinct (he notices echoes, residues, the texture of visions). The prose carries a lyric cadence that modulates with emotional intensity without becoming opaque. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The diction remains within Marcus's plausible lexicon (junkyard prophet, precognitively forgetful) and the syntax reflects his mind under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual specificity ("luminous ache," "frozen breath," "whispered secret"). Dialogue feels purposeful and advances plot; Yua's lines carry subtext and her speech rhythm distinguishes her from Mira. Some diction ("restructuring itself," "escape velocity") edges toward concept-speak at peak moments, slightly elevating register beyond immediate embodied perception. Filter verbs ("saw in them," "thought she had misheard") are sparing and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV (Mira) is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is clean: "decisively kind," "clouds drifting below like slow thoughts," "sterile air" contrasted with "honeysuckle through an open window." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven—Samuel's "What's the point?" and Mira's "You're here now" carry subtext without exposition. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between Mira's close observation and brief lyric expansion ("pulsing stillness"). Filter verbs ("She understood terror") appear but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature—tracing runes, noting bent spoons, focusing on mechanical precision—is consistent and character-specific. The automaton's dialogue ("voice like chimes in distant wind") carries distinct texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("borrowed starlight," "flower remembering spring") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is well-controlled; the narrative stays close to Mira's knowledge state without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Eleanor's perceptual signature is distinct: clinical vocabulary ("calcium and cartilage," "femur") filtered through emotional pressure. Diction remains character-consistent even under stress, with purposeful elevation ("cleft in certainty," "shrewdly innocent in her trespass") that fits her educated register. No head-hopping. Distance control is clean. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional beats (short sentences at the bones discovery, longer reflection in the final paragraphs). The phrase "shrewdly innocent" and "constellations of evidence" feel slightly over-polished but remain voice-plausible for a doctor trained in charity wards.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (grief filtered through craft metaphors: "frosted surfaces reflectively vibrant," "pearl of stillness"). Distance modulates purposefully—closer during polishing, pulling back for the grotto description. Diction stays within a bereaved artisan's lexicon without register drift. The "suddenly Maren understood" pivot is a brief tell that compresses insight efficiently rather than violating POV, and the final paragraphs' rhythm slows to match her departure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Mira's watchful-dreamer lens: "honeyed hush," "She'd always been a watchful dreamer," selective attention to drip patterns. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext—Thea's "I should have been there" and Mira's "You're here now" advance reconciliation without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent (observation, sketching, patience). Brief dip: "the kind of person who noticed things others missed" leans slightly tell-y, though the notebook work demonstrates it.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual filter remains consistent (novelist's lens, manuscript metaphors, narrative vocabulary). Dialogue from the ghost-characters carries subtext and distinct goals—the marine biologist's question, the refugee child's challenge—each line advances Elena's reckoning. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. However, peak interiority leans abstract ("weight of his hope," "act of reaching") rather than grounding thought in rhythm or idiom under stress. Register remains literary and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, and narrative distance is generally controlled. Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices brass gears, lunar cycles, and the vine's tendril. One breach: "Mira spins golden stories into the morning, she realized" breaks modesty—Mira cannot observe her own mythic framing from outside. Diction is mostly clean, but "the desperate reaching of that tendril against her skin" and "infinite moment" lean slightly elevated for a tinkerer's immediate perception. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful and serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is strong ("skeletal apple trees," "flash-paper alchemist," "bones of this place"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue appears; interiority stays concrete. One slight register drift: "alchemist's binding words" gestures at mysticism without grounding the words in Maren's lexicon or embodied state under pressure. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the sealing, and the final sentence's rhythm supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with psychic distance close enough to access Elena's interior ("wonder bloom in her chest, vast and terrifying") and far enough for lyric elevation ("the season hung suspended"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "stumbled and fell wounded into an early winter that refused to commit" establishes the prose's patient, precise rhythm. Perceptual signature is locksmith-specific (tumblers, gears, escapement, mainspring, filing smooth). Filter verbs ("she had realized," "she had learned") are sparse and voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "the harvest of echoes" italicized feels like a prompt echo rather than Elena's phrasing, a small register bump in an otherwise seamless voice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara's craft (threads humming, patterns that never resolve, frequencies of loss). Diction is controlled and purposeful—"shingled hush," "boundary-lessly trapped," "calcifying"—within a consistent lyric register. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during weaving, pulling back slightly for the dawn realization. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "the earth remembered how to breathe" in the opening leans slightly poetic-generic, but recovers quickly. Compression at closure (lamp burner warming, whispering her name) supports pressure without obscuring the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third limited with clean focalization; perceptual signature is consistent (hands, wood grain, light through water). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "grief needed a container," "hauntingly practical," "rust-hued peace." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (ash wood warming in palms) to slightly elevated reflections without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge. Minor penalty for one filter-verb stack in the opening ("letting the gray light wash over her hands") and slight register elevation in "harvested from loss" that, while thematically resonant, edges toward writerly abstraction rather than character-bound thought. The prose as character test is met; syntax reflects Marguerite's deliberate, patient mind.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature (scavenger's eye for debris, temporal slippage). Dialogue feels natural, carries subtext, and advances the negotiation; the ghost's lines pursue accusation then release. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during memory, wider during lagoon description). Diction stays within Mira's pragmatic register. Minor slip: "chronologically confused" is asserted in narration; one more on-page temporal slip would have embodied it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with Maya's engineering lens filtering all perception. Diction stays consistent and purposeful ("redirected flows," "functionally creative") without unmotivated register shifts. Perceptual signature is clear: she sees structure and potential where others see abandonment. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with her emotional state. The voice remains distinct and controlled, though some phrases ("stoic wonder," "patient as stone") lean slightly generic. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all detail through Elara's introverted, music-trained perception (frequencies "only she seemed to hear," subconscious notation in margins). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate at the crying beat, slightly withdrawn during memory passages. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("excruciatingly gentle," "delirious with creative fever," "glacial hush"), with no register drift. The prose reflects her patient, meticulous scribe's mind through syntax that breathes rather than rushes. No dialogue is present to test character distinction, but internal voice is distinct and the perceptual signature—music, crystals, incremental time—is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature favors architectural and structural metaphors ("foundations of fabricated stone," "hollow spaces in narratives"). Diction remains within her investigative lens with purposeful elevation ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity") that fits a legend seeker's vocabulary. Minor slip: the phrase "by training instincts over years of seeking" reads slightly expository in rhythm, though it advances causality. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through a collector's lens (spiral patterns, branching deltas, seed-philosophy parallels). Psychic distance is stable third-limited with purposeful compression during decoding hours. Diction remains character-consistent: "philosophical arguments made tangible," "tactile grammar," "oceanic hush" fit her reflective idiom. Minor rhythm issue: several paragraphs begin with "The" + noun (rope, oceanic hush, fog, snow, final knot, lighthouse beam), creating subtle template cadence in the second half. No dialogue to assess; focalization is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries a consistent lyric register: "lonesome splendor of autumn itself, beautiful and aching, the kind of glory that exists only in ending." Diction is elevated but remains within the narrator's idiom (traveler, writer, grief-cartographer). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices weft threads, the vibrant crimson, the cold, the particular way Matthias laughed. One slip: "projecting presence" is named but not dramatized until late, reducing immediacy. The final paragraphs' syntactic parallelism ("Someone might find them. Someone might understand") reads slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in tight third with Aldric's perceptual signature consistent: he notices the "grinding of gears" as "bitter symphony" and the egg's "swirl of midnight blue and dying starlight." Internal voice is distinct and voice-motivated, with elevated diction ("quaking reverie," "Resonance Reconstruction") matching his scholarly obsession. No head-hopping. The single line of direct speech ("What if the soul persists?") feels natural for a solitary prince hypothesizing aloud. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax when "light erupted" and he "felt it wash over him," then pulls back for the final image. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's firefighter lens filters heat, ash, and transformation throughout. Psychic distance is stable; metaphors (clouds as whales, obsidian as ribs) feel voice-motivated. The recurring "gracefully alert" phrase and "kelp-drift peace" are purposeful compressions that teach the pattern. No head-hopping; interior voice remains consistent under reflection-heavy design.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Mira's skeptical stance ("realistically imaginative, never accepting magic without seeking its underlying logic"). The prose carries a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm and some lovely phrases ("defiant hush that refused to break," "sidereal patience"). However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels slightly exterior to the character's immediate experience ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience" itself), and the voice lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would make it unmistakably Mira's rather than a polished narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent with Veloris's cosmic perspective: "otherworldly sentimentalist," "sonar pinging echoed through the garden," "streams of gentle radiance." Filter verbs ("She understood," "She realized") appear but feel voice-motivated for a contemplative lens. Perceptual signature is present (she notices equations, frequencies, patterns), though under peak pressure (the gear-turning sequence) the syntax remains lyric rather than compressing. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a distinct texture, though some phrases ("troubled serenity," "infinite corridors of space") lean toward stock SF idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV maintains stable distance; Elara's perceptual signature (carver's eye for relationships, meditation practice, family poem-trading) is consistent. Thomas's dialogue feels purpose-driven ("Feel instead how their absences connect") and distinct from Elara's interior rhythms. Minor slip: "his voice arriving like distant thunder rolling across still water" reaches for elevation in a way that slightly exceeds earned register. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices grooves, gears, and fractals of light through a watchmaker's precision. Diction modulates purposefully from elevated lyricism ("blade of frozen night") to tactile simplicity ("soft clicks") as pressure mounts. Minor register drift: "searing reverie of dusk" in the penultimate paragraph elevates slightly beyond the prior voice during the ending's quiet walk, though it remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and character-specific; Mira's perceptual signature (gardener's patience, cemetery metaphors) is consistent and distinct. Diction remains controlled, with purposeful elevated phrasing ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") that reads as narrative texture rather than POV leakage. The letter and tapestry details stay within Mira's knowledge frame. Brief moment of slight overreach: "the old woman had been playing a long game" asserts intention Mira infers, but it reads as motivated inference rather than omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("Mira was terrified") to wider reflection. Diction is elevated and consistent with Mira's profession and temperament—"groundedly imaginative," "ignorance cartographer"—though some phrases ("sustaining transformation," "prevail against the blankness") feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices in cartographic terms (coastlines, trade routes, patterns). No dialogue is present; the story's rhythm supports the reflective, solitary stance. Minor penalty for filter-verb density ("Mira understood," "Mira suspected") in several high-pressure beats, which dulls immediacy slightly but does not collapse voice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance; Helena's perceptual signature (copyist's precision, symphonic vocabulary) is distinct. Diction stays controlled: "thistled calm," "amber light casting shadows," "velvet" mist. Free indirect style is clean ("her motivation had seemed strange even to her at first"). One friction: the phrase "breadcrumbs along the mountain paths" feels slightly generic for this voice, and "authorities heard only a strange woman" shifts briefly toward omniscient certainty without dramatized evidence. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Marina's perceptual signature (charcoal artist noticing "shadow that revealed more than light"). Diction stays character-grounded except one brief elevation ("somber marvel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight during the grinding/scattering, pulling back slightly for the gallery's history, then intimate again at closure. The prose rhythms reflect Marina's state: short, precise sentences during ritual action, longer contemplative ones during reflection. No head-hopping; all knowledge remains Marina-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent philosophical register. Marcus's perceptual signature—seeing artifacts as narratives—is clear and voice-motivated. The prose occasionally drifts toward essay diction ("empirical navigation," "final arbiter of truth") that feels more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, though the abstract register can flatten immediacy in key beats. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Margaret until Darius's brief interiority ("spent two years hating everyone"). Perceptual signature is distinct: Margaret notices the rosette's "carved rosewood pattern" and hears "traveled stillness." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Teach me" carries subtext of grief and hope). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with elevated register fitting Margaret's reflective stance. Minor slip: Darius's self-narrated emotional arc ("You know what brought me back?") edges toward over-articulation for a seventeen-year-old mid-conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Maren's perceptual signature (tasting grandmother's laughter, cheesemaker's grief) is distinctive. The prose rhythm modulates between lyric description and action, though under peak pressure (the three moons aligning) the diction remains elevated rather than tightening. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the voice occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("This gift made her the most sought-after chef") that tells rather than dramatizes status. The final paragraph's "her mind blooming with revolution" edges toward abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature: the light "thick as honey," the "involuntarily truthful in moments that mattered most" self-awareness, the matchbox carried for twelve years. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the truth-telling beats. Dialogue carries goal pursuit and subtext ("You came specifically because the power failed" / "How did you know?"). Minor register drift: "electromagnetic pulse," "navigation protocols," "hive mind" read as exposition rather than Mira's or the woman's natural idiom under grief. The woman's "my daughter's project. Before she—" incompletion works; Mira's interior voice stays consistent. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure, though some late-paragraph phrasing ("ready to guide the next lost traveler through the dark") edges toward summarizing closure rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer," "shard of hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("inadvertently profound," "amber daydreaming"). Distance is consistent; psychic access remains Marina's throughout. No dialogue to evaluate. Mild register elevation in phrases like "sanctify a space" and "hushed blaze" stays within a literary narrator's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Mira with clean access to Veris's telepathic voice (italicized, distinct). Distance control is excellent: Veris's thoughts taste "incisively kind" while Mira's panic "tasted like copper and salt." Perceptual signature is strong—the diver's physical embodiment (bubbles, regulator, knife) grounds the underwater environment. Veris's syntax ("Such grief there, wrapped around a desperate hope") carries a formal, ancient quality distinct from Mira's more immediate reactions. Minor slip: "threaded his final thoughts" in the penultimate section briefly shifts into summary mode when dramatization would strengthen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Vera's perceptual signature: mathematical metaphors ("stress fractals, the golden ratio"), selective physics noticing, and grim pragmatism in grinding steps for chalk. Diction remains character-consistent, with occasional elevated phrases ("the architecture of forever") that fit a mathematician's interior vocabulary. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the crack discovery and opening slightly for the father backstory. The phrase "that stubborn, hoping thing" demonstrates voice control under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV narration is stable with strong perceptual signature: "saffron quiet," "smog-choked city," moonlight "dripped through condensation-streaked panes." Diction remains controlled and lyric throughout. The phrase "rouse within her chest" is filter-heavy but voice-motivated. Minor register drift: "Conceptual repricing" and "consensus reality" do not appear, but "muscle memory that did not belong to her" edges toward passive inheritance rather than active discovery. No head-hopping; distance and tense are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Mira's perceptual signature: she filters the grotto through a curator's lexicon ("Renaissance masters," "Byzantine icons," "culturally continuity"), notices pigment degradation the emerald lens reveals, and narrates in elevated but consistent register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate at "the familiar ache of preservation," then pulling back to frame the children's future with archival detachment. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Mira's liturgy-like teaching ("M is for memory") and her mock-scholarly declaration both advance plot and reveal character. Free indirect style handles her interior monologue cleanly, and diction stays within her educated, historically oriented lexicon without jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Alaric notices gears, springs, and causal mechanisms, filtering the world through a clockmaker's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("wrongness felt like home," "monuments to suffering"). No head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the puzzle-solving beats. Minor register slip: "latent radiance, light that had always been present but never expressed, potential finally becoming kinetic" reads slightly elevated for a man in crisis, though it remains within a clockmaker-philosopher's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with Vera's focalization throughout. Voice carries gothic texture ("silk made of spider legs," "teeth that seemed to exist in too many dimensions") that fits tone and premise. Distance modulates appropriately: close in her chest-pressing terror, more remote when describing the advisor's shifting beauty. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("You said you could help me unbosom this thing"). Some decorative excess in high-pressure beats: "repulsive in his beauty, his face shifting between expressions of hunger and tenderness, each transition nauseating to witness yet impossible to look away from" stacks modifiers without advancing pressure. Perceptual signature is present but leans toward ornamental gothic catalog rather than Vera-specific noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated, lyric register with purposeful compression ("the sky's rough draft of tomorrow," "restless euphony"). POV remains stable in close third, perceptual signature tied to pattern-reading and musical interpretation. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sketched resonance," "liminal moment") but reads voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No dialogue present; psychic distance modulates smoothly between observation and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited with Mira's perceptual signature (cartographic, pattern-focused) consistent throughout. Diction remains apt: "the sound was like the city itself protesting her departure" reflects her place-attuned mind. Psychic distance tightens during the climb and boat launch. No dialogue, so those bullets are moot. Minor: "dread that hummed beneath the warmth" and "questions that no one else seemed to ask" edge toward generic interiority, but concrete actions (tracing shell grooves, blowing the whistle, climbing rust) keep voice anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Vera's perceptual signature (historian's eye for detail, emotional rationality about lies) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("seductive logic," "permission structure") that feels more essayistic than immediate to Vera's crisis moment. The phrase "fictional historian in the truest sense" is clever but pauses momentum for wordplay. Psychic distance remains appropriate; the prose modulates with pressure, tightening toward the upload decision.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric texture ("stoically sensitive," "hushed blaze," "negative space shaped like two people"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Marina notices traces, absences, the interplay of past and present. No dialogue to evaluate. The register occasionally tips into abstraction ("interlaced absence" as a concept Marina explicitly "understands") but the voice remains coherent and purposeful. Diction is controlled, though "hushed blaze" and "interlaced absence" repeat as thematic anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (noticing millimeter shifts, spaces between words) is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains controlled—"dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness"—without register mismatch. No dialogue present; interior texture reflects her indexer's mind. Prose modulates appropriately from anxious chatter (past) to tranquil perception (present). One purposeful compression: "The truth was neither" breaks paragraph rhythm to pivot discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("descended while ascending, her spirit sinking into memory"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent throughout, with purposeful compression ("crafty where others were merely clever"). Filter verbs appear but feel voice-motivated. However, some passages drift into elevated register during emotional beats ("love that refused to let go," "luminous torment") that slightly exceed the established grounding, though not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature—Yara notices "breath fog the glass where stars should have been visible" and interprets clouds as "brain tissue...contemplating nothing," filtering setting through her scientific lens and survivor's consciousness. Diction stays controlled ("perturbation theory," "wave functions") without slipping into lecture. The prose modulates from clinical calculation to sensory immediacy ("copper and ash") under pressure. Very minor slip: "the sensation of being half-awake in a world that demanded full consciousness" is slightly over-articulated for peak stress, though it remains character-plausible given Yara's analytical bent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is controlled and the narrative certainty stays within her knowledge bounds. Voice texture is present in phrases like "brilliant dimness" and "perpetually surprised," though the latter is repeated without functional variation. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, advancing the chip revelation and map interpretation without subtext. The prose modulates appropriately from observational calm to discovery, though the final paragraph slips into a more distant, summarizing register ("not closure, but continuation") that abstracts the moment rather than anchoring it in Mira's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (Maren notices carving craftsmanship, frames her work as "manufacturing false memories") but occasionally shifts into elevated register during reflection ("tempered regret," "withheld truth") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Narrative stance modulates appropriately from detached description to embodied grief at the confession moment. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood") appear but don't severely dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt. Mira's perceptual signature (the professional negotiator filtering everything through precedent and process) is consistent. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext: Varen's "Superstition?" and Mira's "Practicality" reveal mutual testing. Her brother's truncated line and Mira's interruption show power dynamics. Diction remains within Mira's lexicon; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose modulates cleanly from procedural cool to embodied emotion (gripping the drawer pull, watching her brother's gaunt face) without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Elena notices swells, constellations, navigation landmarks through professional lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the kayak launch, pulling back slightly for the utility-pole catalog. Diction remains consistent and character-appropriate: "backlash of regrets," "stubborn presence," "merrily melancholic" all fit a navigator's idiom. Free indirect style is clean. Reflection integrates without filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "That uncertainty was the cruelest part" tells what the prior beat showed, a brief redundancy that doesn't harm momentum. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout. Marcus's perceptual signature—reading hidden patterns, feeling phantom weight, numbness giving way to stirring—is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Elena's lines wound, reveal, and guide without exposition dumps. Diction stays within Marcus's plausible lexicon (con artist, memory wipe, emotional hollowness) with occasional lyric elevation ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder") that reads purposeful rather than intrusive. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. Minor note: Elena's voice occasionally converges with Marcus's internal register in her longer speech, though this does not create confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices the orchard's hum, fruit glow, and scent spirals as a beast whisperer attuned to living systems. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Kael's "You finally cracked the fortune" advances plot and his translucent voice "was the wind through silver leaves" integrates description with speech. Weaknesses: elevated diction ("metamorphosis," "cosmic intimacy," "harmonics that weren't human") reads more authorial than character-particular, and several filter verbs ("felt her brother's laughter echo") dull immediacy at peak beats. The prose occasionally slips into summary ("She had refused this bargain for three years, had raged against it") where scene-level resistance would sharpen her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Morrigan notices through cartomantic metaphor ("divination was not prophecy but archaeology") and maternal exhaustion. Distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the card-door moment. However, elevated diction—"choking beauty," "wounded" stars, "fault line" imagery—occasionally strains against the focalizer's lived-in voice, especially during peak emotional beats. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm accelerates through the ritual sequence, though the final paragraph's certainty ("never forgetting again") reads as narratorial assurance rather than character-earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mei Lin; perceptual signature is consistent (gravitational metaphors, workshop focus, meditative stitching). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the photograph confrontation, slightly wider in the opening drift through corridors. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("ghostly resolve," "cathedral of salvaged memories"), though a few phrases ("shadow work" repeated as term, "liquid starfire") edge toward slight over-lyricism. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The prose reflects her contemplative stance under pressure without flattening urgency at the hundredth-tear beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric, contemplative, with a consistent register that matches Miriam's meditative state. Diction is elevated but POV-appropriate ("crushed obsidian," "deliberate dispossession"), and perceptual signature is strong—she notices texture, light, invisible threads. No dialogue appears; the single other character (geologist) is brief and functional. Psychic distance remains stable throughout, and the prose modulates smoothly from reflection to ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in close third with Maren throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—"the lens through which she saw the world" as vigilance, "precision she applied to everything"—is character-specific and controls what she notices. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("intrigue could move freely," "truth wrapped in shadow"). The distance modulates appropriately during reflective beats versus action. One minor slip: "the kind of mind that saw opportunity in incompletion" briefly adopts omniscient commentary about the dead astronomer rather than filtering it through Maren's inference, creating a momentary POV leak.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (Meren notices patterns, geometry, the eels' formations). Diction matches her voice: "slick stone," "seal-skin pouch," "collapsed star dust," technical without academic drift. The aurora description ("silk torn from dying stars") and the eels as "thoughts through a dreaming mind" carry a lyric register that fits the mystical premise. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs ("she could feel," "she saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the closure beat. Minor: the phrase "harness the sacred patterns at last" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward telling, though it follows the dramatized star-dust pour and vision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Elena's lens filters storm, timer, and photograph through her poet's idiom. Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("rarified her anger," "storm-kissed wonder"), though occasional phrases ("impossible to cage," "fierce and precise") trend toward stock metaphor. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. The prose carries a distinct texture, but some figurative choices in peak beats (e.g., "furiously tranquil waves," "shadow alphabets") hover near decorative rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and occasionally ornamental ("dignified chaos," "velvet courtesy that concealed iron demands") but stays within a philosophical-adventure register. Dialogue between Elara and Krell advances goals and carries subtext ("Curious that it remains unfinished"). However, the narrator's perceptual signature is not character-particular; phrases like "Such was the dignified chaos" read as authorial commentary rather than Elara's focalized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-specific, with a lyric, heightened register ("luminous and cracked, fractured light through broken glass"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider reflection. Dialogue is sparse but character-distinct; Ezra's "Resistance isn't complicated" and "Philosophy section's about to get dangerous" carry his poet-vagrant idiom. Diction occasionally risks elevated abstraction ("anarchy," "chrysalis," "luminous space") but remains coherent within the reflective mode. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (musician's ear, strategic creativity, mechanical detail). Diction stays character-apt: "strategically creative," "frequencies that could serve as lighthouse and compass rose alike." The husband's single whispered line and her reply carry subtext without over-explanation. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates from contemplative (opening) to urgent (climax) to quiet (close) without register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct and stable, blending Yara's analytical precision with emergent lyricism ("doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence," "empirically whimsical"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices soil dampness, categorizes botanical contradictions, measures erosion. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the shape of caring itself, the pattern of attention" in the vision risks elevated abstraction slightly outside her established diction, though it reads as epiphanic register shift rather than voice break. No dialogue present; single-POV focalization is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mei's perspective. Perceptual signature is present (she notices the compass warming, traces lace patterns) and diction reflects her contemplative stance. Mr. Tanaka's dialogue ("Your grandmother... she could never speak her sorrows directly") carries gentle formality consistent with his "slow-spoken" characterization. Minor register drift: phrases like "diffuse through the pattern like light through water" and "calcify into years" elevate beyond Mei's established idiom during peak emotional beats, though the effect remains mostly voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical but controlled register well-matched to a reflective, technically skilled artist. Diction (“molten glass,” “algorithmic logic,” “scorched testament”) creates a distinct texture without sliding into academic or jargony territory. Psychic distance stays appropriate; we inhabit her perceptions without head-hopping or authorial intrusion beyond some thematic explicitness. Rhythm modulates with the scene—slower, meditative cadences through the night, tightening slightly around the cipher discovery and decision.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and persuasive, with a strong perceptual signature in its fusion of scientific and lyrical diction (“thermal fluctuations in living tissue,” “crystalline cathedral of frozen life”). The narrative filters description through Margaret’s sensibilities as a scientist-artist coping with silence, which keeps the lyricism grounded. Tense and distance are stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. A few explanatory sentences lean toward a neutral expository register, but they don’t seriously disrupt the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)

There’s a distinct narrative texture here, even if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured and consistently filtered through Mei-Lin’s sensibility as an artist of light and breath, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm feel controlled without stiffness, and the modest dialogue is natural and subtextually aligned with grief and release. The omniscience is disciplined; we don’t stray into others’ interiority beyond what Mei-Lin could infer. Minor moments of theme-forward phrasing don’t significantly disrupt the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, lyrical texture, with a distinct conceptual lexicon (hyperbolic geometry, negative curvature, temporal cloth) that feels coherent with Elara’s mind and the story’s aims. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the modulation between technical and poetic diction generally feels intentional rather than jarring. The narrative stance balances explanation and sensory impression well enough that the nonstandard concepts remain legible. At times the abstract register slightly distances us from her immediate bodily experience, which keeps the voice from feeling utterly singular under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV on Mira is stable and coherent, with interior focus aligned to her mission and skills. Prose texture is competent and occasionally striking (“dormant miracles,” the toy shelves “watching” with button eyes) without straying from her plausible lexicon.

The voice works well but isn’t especially idiosyncratic or formally daring for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)

The prose texture feels distinct and consistent enough to be memorable at a literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, especially in how it attends to light and art. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence structures that support both atmosphere and momentum. There is no head-hopping, and the single line of dialogue is functional and in-character. At times the narration leans on familiar phrases (“destiny’s door,” “practiced invisibility”), which slightly dulls its distinctiveness but not its overall effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, especially the device of Elena narrating herself in mock-omniscient chapter headings; it feels character-rooted, not gimmicky.

The voice could be pushed slightly further toward the oracle’s idiosyncratic worldview to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice—slanted through a machine consciousness enriched by human fragments—is consistent, lyrical, and recognizably biased (it notices loops, procedures, cataloguing). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with good modulation between concrete detail and abstract reflection. Occasional phrases (“geometries that should not have existed,” “transparent as memory”) edge toward the familiar rather than idiosyncratically Unit-7, slightly diluting the uniqueness of the perceptual signature. Still, the narrative stance never wobbles into head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice through Mira is steady, confident, and textured, with lyricism that feels consistent with her reflective, archivist sensibility. Phrasings like “ambiguously clear—sharp in focus but wavering in meaning, like truth itself” establish a distinct perceptual signature without becoming opaque.

The modulation from cool observation to a warmer, more intimate rhythm at the end is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice around Esther is consistent and textured, with a gardener’s perceptual signature (attention to roots, mulch, cuttings) informing diction and imagery. Lyric touches like “the maze breathed its ancient breath” feel controlled and congruent rather than ornamental.

POV remains stable with only mild, intentional lyric omniscience, and rhythm modulates well between summary and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and character-specific, blending technical diction (“resonance scanner,” “electromagnetic fields”) with quietly lyrical phrasing that feels plausible for a contemplative mechanic. The perceptual signature—machines and alien creatures filtered through a systems-thinker’s eye—is distinct and stable. Rhythm varies well between descriptive, reflective, and action-oriented sentences, with no intrusive head-hopping or stance confusion. A few elevated formulations flirt with authorial rather than strictly character-bound language, but they remain within a believable register for this protagonist and genre.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and suitably lyrical without losing clarity. Diction aligns with Clara’s sensibility: musical metaphors, attention to the pit and performance language, and a quiet, observant tone that fits her marginal position. Psychic distance is well-controlled, slipping smoothly between external description and interior inference without head-hopping. There are a few slightly generic phrases, but overall the perceptual signature is consistent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with weather and botanical imagery functioning as a clear perceptual signature for Cassandra. Diction and rhythm suit a reflective oracle who is both scientifically literate (weather instruments) and steeped in her grandmother’s art; there’s no distracting register drift. Dialogue between Cassandra and Mira is spare, natural, and layered with subtext, advancing both theme and conflict without over-explaining. Psychic distance remains stable, and the few more elevated abstractions feel earned by the character rather than imposed by an external narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture that blends grim humor (“breathing asbestos like it was mountain air”) and lyrical observation. Diction and metaphor feel plausible for Marcus’s perspective—educated but not academic—and the narrative distance stays steady. The interleaving of Clara’s crackling calls via earbuds is handled cleanly and enriches voice and mood without head-hopping. The modulation from “drowsy alertness” to a sharper, more deliberate cadence at the end effectively mirrors his internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrically confident, and clearly filtered through Maren’s contemplative sensibility, with consistent diction and rhythm. Syntax varies well between long, flowing descriptive sentences and tighter, declarative ones, supporting the meditative tone. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the omniscient-leaning distance feels intentional and apt for a story about witnessing across seasons. The main limit is that the voice rarely modulates under any increased pressure, so it risks a slightly uniform emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, warm, and observant, with a clear perceptual signature centered on Elena’s attentiveness to sensory and emotional nuance. Dialogue feels natural and age-appropriate, especially Maya’s mix of bluntness and vulnerability; it advances stakes rather than filling space. Lyric touches (“ordinary magic,” “dreaming roots”) repeat in a controlled way that suits the reflective tone. There’s minimal exposition creep or register mismatch, and psychic distance is handled steadily.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and rhythm are consistent and appropriate to a reflective, post-cataclysmic scholar; the register doesn’t drift distractingly. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance stays close enough to Maren to feel character-colored rather than generic. Under peak beats (tapestry discovery, axis realization), the voice holds together without expository backfill or clumsy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature: calm, analytic, lightly sardonic, steeped in a lifetime of surveillance and patterning. Diction (“transpose life into a new key,” “orchestrate meaning itself”) fits both her intellectual background and the quasi-musical metaphor of re-keying a life. Narration balances concrete detail with abstract reflection without losing track of the physical scene. A few thematic pronouncements slightly flatten the voice into authorial commentary, but they don’t break POV control or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person on Marcus is steady and controlled, with a confident, slightly ornate register that matches an intellectual priest in a metaphysical crisis. Dialogue between Marcus, Elena, and the entity interweaves naturally and drives action rather than merely explaining it. Devices like the looped questions and “bell wrapped in cloth” show good rhythmic and imagistic control without obscuring clarity. Occasionally the narration leans toward abstract phrasing (“cathedral of logic,” “designed to plumb the depths of her doubt”), but it remains coherent and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that feels plausibly aligned with Li Wei’s interior life and history. Syntax and rhythm vary, with some beautiful, image-rich sentences that maintain clarity. The narrative stance holds steady in time and distance, and there’s no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. If anything, the voice leans a bit toward a familiar “literary lyricism” rather than something unmistakably idiosyncratic, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits the speculative-philosophical mode. Diction (e.g., “darkening brightness,” “procedural generation”) is consistent with a slightly elevated, conceptual sensibility and doesn’t break POV plausibility in this context. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and key phrases are repeated in a patterned, intentional way rather than as scaffolding. The voice is strong but not especially idiosyncratic; it could be further distinguished through more character-specific perceptual quirks.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and controlled, with a lyrical but not overwrought texture that suits the subject. POV is clean and consistently bound to Marina’s sensory world, with smart emphasis on touch and sight over hearing. Diction and rhythm modulate nicely between calm description and heightened interior beats during the ritual. A few lines lean toward general poeticism rather than Marina-specific perception, but overall the voice feels coherent and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, observant, and well-matched to Mira’s meticulous, reflective mind; diction is elevated but not implausible for the character. The narrative distance is consistent, with interiority and description braided smoothly and no head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentences modulating between long, lush lines and tighter phrases at turns (“Now impossibility shifted beneath her like loose earth.”). A few expository sentences edge toward authorial rather than character-inflected language, but overall the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Maren’s reflective, cautious sensibility. Diction (“cathedral of glass and regret,” “crystal shadows”) establishes a distinct texture without feeling mannered, and interior access is steady and plausible.

Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and unified, with only minor moments where abstraction nudges slightly away from Maren’s embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual filter (time having texture, objects holding sedimented stories). Dialogue is sparse but natural and charged, especially the “ethically playful” exchange, which feels like two distinct sensibilities in tension. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, and the speculative elements are narrated with quiet confidence rather than exposition. A few lines edge toward essayistic abstraction, but they don’t break POV integrity or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Marina’s acoustic sensitivity, as in hearing “absence of what should have been there.” Rhythm and diction are controlled, with varied sentence structures and a measured, contemplative cadence that suits the material.

Diction and syntax are elevated but not implausible for the character; they sustain a lyrical, slightly clinical tone that fits an “emotion chemist” world.

The modulation at the end toward a gentler, less clinical cadence supports the emotional turn without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, polished, and well suited to Marina’s blend of pragmatism and lyric sensitivity. Diction is precise without feeling overwrought, and the narrative stance remains stable in time and psychic distance. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, especially Elias’s first reaction to the photograph. The main limitation is that the voice, while elegant, leans a little toward “standard literary” rather than an unmistakably idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyric texture that feels aligned to Veren’s sensibility—attentive to pattern, absence, and touch. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating smoothly between lush description and quieter exposition.

There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the lyricism never fully detaches from the character’s plausible perceptual world.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Miriam’s visual and temporal sensitivity. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the register stays consistent with the quasi-mythic, SF-fantasy setting. There is no dialogue, but interior and descriptive cadences carry the narrative without feeling monotonous. The voice could perhaps risk a few sharper, more surprising turns under peak stress, but as-is it is distinct and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Mira’s, with a perceptual signature that blends emotional and mathematical metaphors in a controlled way. The few lines of dialogue from the apparition have a distinct, airy quality that fits its nature without disrupting POV or register. Diction and syntax are elevated but not implausible for the frame, and psychic distance is well-managed—zooming out for conceptual phrasing, then back into tactile details like tracing the mosaic. There are no jarring shifts in tense, stance, or unexplained knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct: lyrical but controlled, with a strong perceptual signature in how Maren notices infrastructure, hidden caches, and small domestic traces. Syntax varies well, and the narrative distance stays stable, dipping closer around sense memories without head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction like “sapphire hush” and “spaces between walls” feels character-compatible and pattern-consistent rather than imposed. A slight tendency toward explicit thematic phrasing prevents it from feeling utterly effortless, but the POV handling itself is assured.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with an older, reflective botanist: diction like “specimens,” “storm season,” and “phases of the moon” feels character-grounded rather than generic. Rhythm varies well, with longer meditative sentences easing into shorter, charged lines around key turns (“She would not become a tree.”). There is no head-hopping or register clash, and the narrative certainty maps plausibly to what Vera can infer from her body and environment. The lyricism stays legible, rarely tipping into obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature (attention to water, light, and ruin). Theo’s dialogue is spare but distinct enough, and the narrative never slips into unearned omniscience or head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between description and key turns without losing clarity. The only limitation is occasional generalized abstraction (“meaning,” “experience”) that momentarily flattens an otherwise vivid voice.

    The third-person-limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical-but-precise texture that fits a meticulous mapper encountering the uncanny. Diction and rhythm are well modulated between contemplative exposition and higher-tension beats (midnight, door opening). The brief spoken dialogue at the end feels natural and thematically weighted without over-explaining. There’s a mild uniform loftiness to the register, but it aligns with the chosen mode rather than reading as drift.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Mira’s reflective, slightly numbed state. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with cosmic/poetic language that stays coherent rather than drifting into abstraction. Aldric’s dialogue is distinct enough, formal and gently mystical, contrasting with Mira’s more questioning interiority. There are a few elevated phrases that feel more authorial than character-specific, but they don’t compromise point-of-view integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Vera’s vast perspective, with strong control over rhythm and elevated diction that matches the cosmic subject matter. The limited dialogue is natural and functional, giving texture to the other immortals without breaking the narrative’s tonal unity. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge slips, and the occasional omniscient-style phrasing still feels anchored in Vera’s long experience. There is a mild tendency toward generalized philosophical narration, but it doesn’t significantly undercut the voice’s distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with consistent psychic distance and a clear perceptual signature in how Maya notices legal/immigration nuances and moral “mathematics.” Dialogue is lean, natural, and carries subtext, especially in the exchanges about asylum, theft, and “waiting” vs. “sending.” The narrative register is elevated but believable for this character and context. A few thematic abstractions slightly flatten the otherwise textured voice but do not break cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)

Diction and rhythm match Mei’s quiet obsessiveness and the contemplative tone of the piece, and there are no POV slips or unexplained distance shifts. The narrator’s mild omniscient reach into customers’ experiences feels like reflective extension rather than a break in stance. Modulation is subtle but present as the hum’s description shifts, maintaining clarity under the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with salt, rust, and tide imagery forming a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and syntax remain consistent with a reflective but grounded focalizer, and psychic distance is steady. Expository passages about the Meridian and hospital read as part of her ongoing mental processing rather than authorial intrusion. There’s no head-hopping or register slip, and the voice modulates slightly with tension (more concrete when eavesdropping, more abstract at the end) in a purposeful way.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and colored by Mira’s professional lens; phrases like “orderly intuitive” and “culture shock absorber” feel character-specific rather than generic. Prose rhythm is varied and generally tight, with exposition woven through present-moment observation (“tourists too enchanted to notice the community meetings happening in the spaces between spectacle”). Dialogue is brief but functional, reflecting status (Tomás’s authority vs. Mira’s responsibility) without over-explaining. There are a few slightly essayistic sentences that momentarily widen distance, but they don’t break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, observant, and inflected with Elena’s professional and emotional lens, yielding a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm are well-modulated, shifting smoothly between long, lyrical sentences and tighter, time-pressed beats around the chemical packets. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; reflective passages feel anchored to the present moment’s stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong sensory signature shaped by sound, touch, and thermal awareness instead of sight. Prose maintains a poised, almost meditative distance that suits Elara’s “magnetic calm” while still conveying technical process clearly. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable. There is occasional explanatory phrasing, yet overall the narrative stance feels controlled and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, controlled, and distinct, blending technical precision with restrained lyricism in a way that fits a seasoned cartographer. Maren’s perceptual signature—seeing scars, patterns, and mislabeling everywhere—is consistent, and Volkov’s sparse, resigned dialogue provides a clear tonal counterpoint. Diction is elevated but plausible for the character and setting, and psychic distance stays stable in a close third. The prose modulates rhythm effectively between description, thought, and dialogue without any POV leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice has a confident, mythic register that stays consistent, with measured sentences and controlled lyricism (“fifteen souls shuffled…their presence a whisper against the town's cavernous silence”). Distance is slightly elevated but stable, matching the fable-like frame of an enigmatic, near-immortal figure. There is no real dialogue to test, but the brief spoken line at the end feels fittingly oracular and restrained. The voice’s texture—formal but not purple—supports the tone and never drifts into exposition-heavy or academic language.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and textured, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits Marina’s scientific background and the story’s meditative mode. Diction like “lonesome splendor,” “gathered hush,” and “as only drowned things can be” gives the prose a distinct sonic signature without slipping into purple excess. Psychic distance is well managed: we stay inside Marina’s perceptions and inferences, and the few brief generalizations (“She had come to understand why no rescue ever arrived…”) feel earned. The lack of dialogue is appropriate to the solitude of the scene, and the narrative cadence tightens appropriately around the altar and loosens again as she ascends.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Milo’s age and worldview, with strong recurring diction (“copperlight,” “hush,” “impossibilities”). Metaphors like “something that wore silence like skin” and “space between cry and answer” feel both stylistically unified and thematically driven. Psychic distance stays tight without head-hopping, and the narration doesn’t over-explain what the images already imply. The only slight limitation is that the voice sometimes steps into generalized aphorism, which flattens its otherwise sharp particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with strong rhythmic control (“like smoke, like prayer, like a bride…”). Diction and image selection create a distinct perceptual signature for Elias—practical yet steeped in inherited wonder. Maren’s brief dialogue is stylistically aligned but carries a sufficiently different timbre to mark her as otherworldly without head-hopping.

    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctive, with a strong sensory and metaphorical palette tied to Meren’s craft and world.

Overall the voice feels mature and confident, with only minor moments of thematic telling that brush against over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a rational exile rediscovering wonder. Rhythm and diction modulate well between description and insight; there’s no head-hopping or register drift. Phrases like “diaspora returnee chasing faith down into the earth of her ancestors” exemplify a distinct, controlled texture.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)

The prose modulates rhythm appropriately between reflective and tense beats, supporting the tone without obtrusive flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature: Celeste sees the world in terms of song, thresholds, and liminal spaces. Register and diction fit a seasoned medium haunted by Catholic imagery and family myth, and the narrative never overreaches what she can plausibly infer. Moments of quoted speech (boatman, spirit, mother’s final line) are brief but distinct and functional, carrying subtext without exposition. Psychic distance narrows effectively at the climax without slipping into preachy or expository interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with sensory-rich, slightly lyrical diction that fits Marina’s reflective, language-attuned mind.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but precise texture that fits Margot’s artistic, methodical mind. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, and the narrative distance stays stable; phrases like “Nested awakenings, she thought” cue interiority cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a controlled mix of lyrical description and clear exposition.

Diction and rhythm support a thoughtful, almost reverent tone that fits both her engineer’s precision and the quasi-sacred setting. There’s no head-hopping or unjustified elision; the retrospective dam explanation reads as Mira’s reconstruction, not authorial intrusion. A slightly greater modulation in sentence rhythm at peak emotional beats could heighten impact further, but control is already strong.

The modulation from descriptive lyricism into slightly plainer, prayer-like phrasing at the climax (“Ceiling And Visibility OK. Permission to see clearly. Permission to land.”) is especially effective.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, textured, and clearly inflected by Marcus’s history (firefighting metaphors, competence with terrain, unsentimental observations). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with a good mix of long sinuous sentences and shorter punches at emotional pivots, especially around the crack in the box and the release of the ashes. The register leans a bit more lyrical and abstract in places than a working firefighter’s everyday language, but the elevated prose generally reads as grief-heightened rather than implausible omniscience. There is no POV leakage or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled lyrical register that fits Marina’s reflective, analytical temperament.

Dialogue sounds natural, concise, and goal-driven, cleanly distinguishing Marcus’s reflective, metaphor-friendly idiom from Vera’s more direct, fact-oriented stance. The brief omniscient aside (“though she would later deny it”) is a slight distance shift but feels intentional and doesn’t blur focalization. Rhythm varies well across exposition, description, and dialogue, supporting mood and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyric but grounded, with a consistent esoteric-realist sensibility in its metaphors and diction. POV is stable and modest; the narration never claims knowledge beyond what Vera could reasonably infer in this slightly heightened reality. Rhythm varies well between longer, lush descriptive sentences and tighter, focused lines at moments of emotional turn (the butterfly landing, the silent weeping). It falls just shy of the 9-band only because the voice does not significantly warp or fracture under peak stress; it stays beautifully controlled rather than riskier or more idiosyncratic in extremis.

Temporal and conceptual exposition is woven into the voice rather than bolted on, so the explanation of paths and phantom timelines feels like an extension of Mira’s thought.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, confident, and consistent: elevated but not overwrought, with a clear match to a rigorously intellectual protagonist.

Dialogue is sharp, age-appropriate, and goal-driven, clearly distinguishing Petra’s voice from Mira’s without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet generally clear, with a consistent sensibility that marries decay, surrealism, and reflective thought. Diction like “unkindled solace” and “blissfully aberrant joy” risks slight register drift but overall feels coherent with the story’s fairy-tale/ghost-carnival atmosphere rather than imported theory-speak. Dialogue between Maya and her sister is natural and subtextual enough to carry their differing stances on memory without sounding expository.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and slightly lyrical, well-matched to an archivist who sees the universe as a filing system. POV control is solid with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction (“methodical,” “mechanism,” “ceremonial chamber”) coheres with the character’s mindset. Occasionally the narration drifts into essayistic abstraction about fables and absence, losing some of the embodied specificity that makes earlier passages sing. Still, the voice feels distinct and assured overall.

Diction and cadence are controlled, with recurring metaphors of tides and time that feel like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic “poetic” prose. Dialogue is natural, with Elena’s sharper, plainer lines contrasting Mira’s more meditative speech and carrying subtext about hurt and defense. Occasional narratorial statements about the grotto’s history and patience complement rather than disrupt the established distance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature—sensory crossovers like “silence tasted like possibility” and “intangible weight” feel tied to Mira’s psyche, not generic lyricism.

There is no head-hopping or register drift, and reflection is interleaved cleanly with present stimuli. The voice could risk slightly more idiosyncrasy under peak stress, but it’s already strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly biased by Eris’s acoustic sensibility—she reads the world in vibrations, echoes, and silences rather than generic visuals. Diction like “fluidly logical patterns” and “quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo” feels native to this world and character rather than imposed. Psychic distance stays tight enough to preserve immediacy while allowing occasional, controlled exposition about Mira and the storm-watchers. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the modulation from technical to gently mystical at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, confident, and tonally suited to a mythic-sf hybrid, with controlled elevated diction that fits a sixty-four-year-old lore keeper. Phrases like “droplets that gleamed like scattered data points” and “forgotten circuitry that had once monitored the health of dynasties” give the narrative a distinct texture without drifting into academic or corporate register. POV distance stays stable and there is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. It’s strong, workmanlike literary voice rather than uniquely signature, which keeps it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly colored by Mira’s sensibility (ritualized solitude, “loaded emptiness,” attention to thresholds and scars). Dialogue is spare but effective, with Sera’s lines carrying need and understanding without info-dump bloat; it advances the core conflict directly. The narrative rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and tighter, decision-focused beats. There are no POV slips or register shocks, though a few thematic statements lean a bit more abstract than the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—wry, wounded, and curious—with consistent diction that fits Vera’s analytical bent and the speculative premise. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping and a stable distance that can flex into lyric abstraction without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and syntax show a consistent perceptual signature—he thinks in terms of orders, oaths, glass, and wounds in the sky. Lyrical phrases like “shivering bliss” recur without becoming incoherent, though at times the register drifts toward generalized “fantasy-poetic” more than idiosyncratically Aldric. Still, distance and access are well controlled, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and plausibly Eleanor’s—precise, observant, and slightly ceremonious, befitting an archivist.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, confident, and clear, with an unobtrusive narrative stance that generally respects what Mira could plausibly know while allowing some controlled exposition. Word choice and rhythm are competent and occasionally striking (“holding the line against the tyranny of indifference”), and the focalization remains stable. However, the voice lacks a deeply idiosyncratic texture; some lines drift toward generic SF-dystopia register rather than a distinctly Mira-shaped perception. There are no serious POV slips or dialogue issues to undercut craft.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrically rich, and character-specific, with a consistent perceptual bias toward sound, light, and atmospheric detail. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentences that modulate well between lush description and clearer expository beats.

    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that matches the fantastical setting, with controlled diction and a clear perceptual signature shaped by Wren’s work and reverence. Phrases like “the hush where past meets prophecy” and “constellation of remembrance” feel distinctive without tipping into incoherence. The modulation from grey routine to charged hush to post-transformation clarity is smoothly handled, with no POV slippage or register breaks. A few lines lean toward familiar lyric shorthand (“something long dormant finally finding sun”), but they don’t materially damage the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, observant, and colored by Mira’s vocation—phrases like “gears that no longer measured time” and “a clock that pretended to certainty” give a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and sentence variety are well-handled, shifting between long, image-heavy lines and tighter, decision-focused ones in step with the story’s contemplative but forward-moving pace. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance remains stable and plausibly limited to what Mira can infer, with no head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)

Rhythm varies effectively between sinuous descriptive sentences and shorter, declarative realizations as emotions crest. There’s no POV leakage or register clash, and the understated dialogue through the harp is tonally aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly shaped by Elena’s professional and bodily experience, blending technical language (“optimization function,” “variable”) with sensorial, trauma-inflected imagery. The proprioceptive lexicon feels earned and character-specific rather than generic SF jargon, and the narrative distance stays tight without head-hopping. Rhythm and sentence structure vary enough to sustain lyric intensity without losing clarity. Occasionally the diction tilts a bit expository in thematic lines, but overall the voice is distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, confident, and closely aligned with Miriam’s perceptual biases—technical, pattern-focused, yet open to the uncanny.

    The third-person, close-focus voice is consistent and lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (“clouds that remembered nothing and forgot even less”) that suits the negotiable-reality setting. Diction and rhythm modulate well with pressure—more expansive and contemplative early, more kinetic around the lever pull and shuddering library.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly ornate diction that fits Maren’s sensibility as a poet-scholar. The narration stays within her perceptual frame and biases, especially in how it describes time and architecture, without head-hopping or register glitches. Rhythmic variation supports mood shifts from quiet observation to the charged moment at the mirror. The lyricism is strong enough for high-tier markets, though a few cadences flirt with over-polish and could use a sharper, more idiosyncratic edge to feel fully singular.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)

Phrasing like “murder of meaning” and “silent as a held breath” feels intentional and character-colored enough to avoid generic narration.

A few lines verge on elevated abstraction but remain within a coherent register, so the voice feels purposeful rather than showy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s observational, technical bent (“calibrate terror into sound,” “microclimate variations”). Rhythm and diction modulate with the solstice build without becoming mannered, and there’s no head-hopping. A faint editorial omniscience in lines like “in valleys she would never see, Mira imagined people pausing” is still plausibly her inference, but it edges toward authorial overview rather than strictly character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Erasmus’s learned, archaic sensibility. Elevated diction suits a man fluent in Sumerian and Akkadian and never feels like authorial puffery detached from POV. Syntax varies smoothly between longer meditative sentences and tighter descriptive ones, supporting the contemplative pressure rather than flattening it. No head-hopping or stance wobble appears; the narrative distance feels confidently chosen and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and colored by Marta’s sensibility: attention to scent, decay, and transformation threads naturally through the narration. Lyric phrases like “wild hush” and “metal dreaming of earth” feel of a piece rather than ornamental, and Ven’s brief dialogue is serviceable and distinct enough. There is confident control of psychic distance, moving smoothly between external observation and interior stakes without head-hopping. A touch more idiosyncratic rhythm or diction tied specifically to Marta’s age and history could push this higher.

Metaphors like “nomadic penumbra” and “luminous absence” feel of a piece with her worldview, not pasted-on ornament. Psychic distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few explanatory sentences read a bit more like an external essayist than her interior texture, but they don’t seriously compromise coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and well matched to Edwin’s reflective, artistic sensibility; diction and metaphor feel plausibly his.

Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly from atmospheric description to close interiority.

A touch of generalized phrasing in some thematic lines keeps it just shy of exceptional.

    The close third-person voice is steady, assured, and well-matched to a meticulous, empirically minded map dealer; diction and syntax feel consistent with her education and temperament. The narrative filters details through her professional lens (watermarks, matrix chips, coordinates), giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“stopped her breath,” “like captured starlight”), but they don’t meaningfully erode the voice’s coherence or control. Dialogue is sparse and functional; the father’s single speech leans slightly didactic but stays within plausible register.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with imagery and diction clearly filtered through the queen’s sensibility. Lyric passages (“clouds that wrapped the mountain like funeral shrouds,” “starlight bleeding… like luminescent ichor”) feel controlled rather than indulgent and match the tone. Dialogue is clean, compressed, and carries subtext, particularly in the oracle’s refusal to indulge the queen’s demand for more omens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a world where alchemy and scientific discourse blur (“emotional chemistry,” “calibrating its rays”). Mira’s perceptual signature—seeing geometry, density, and half-lives in emotional states—helps distinguish her without breaking plausibility. Dialogue generally sounds natural within this heightened register and carries subtext about leaving, change, and fear of loss rather than just surface info. There is some slight convergence between narrative and dialogue diction at times, but not enough to confuse POV or drain texture.

    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly Mira’s, with imagery choices (storms, ink, ice, crows) forming a coherent perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with longer, image-rich sentences suiting the meditative pressure of the ritual without drifting into abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and reflective moments are anchored in present stimuli (scar, steam, crows).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a consistent, lightly wry tone that fits a “gossip-column exorcist” moving through a dusty archive. Musical and religious metaphors recur in a controlled way, and Eleanor’s dialogue contrasts nicely with Marcus’s more grounded, metaphor-prone speech. POV distance is stable and avoids head-hopping, and dialogue reads natural yet purposeful, advancing emotion and plot.

Diction and syntax maintain a measured rhythm that supports the contemplative, accumulating tension of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward space, architecture, and invisible geometries that feels rooted in Maya’s character.

POV is stable and clean; we never slip inside callers’ minds beyond what their speech reveals.

Imagery such as “its voice the sound of paper settling” and “features that shifted like pages turning in wind” feels both apt and character-inflected. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying exposition and emotional stakes without sounding wooden. There are a few familiar lyrical turns, yet overall the perceptual signature is steady and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly wry lyricism that fits Maya’s worldview. Dialogue sounds natural and distinct—Okonkwo’s measured, slightly eccentric precision contrasts with Maya’s humor and deflection—while also carrying exposition efficiently. The prose modulates well between descriptive lyric and crisp, functional lines in conversation.

Technical/scientific terms are sprinkled in but kept digestible and in keeping with the story’s speculative-literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice filtered through a former performer is distinctive: her mock-epic narration of mundane tasks is both coping mechanism and tonal engine. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and suited to her theatrical yet hollowed mind, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Expository patches about the Mandate and Great Mourning are integrated smoothly enough that they don’t break voice, though they are a bit more straightforward than the most charged passages.

Syntax and rhythm modulate well—more expansive in reflective passages, tighter in key realizations—without lapsing into opacity. Diction stays coherent with Elara’s experience and milieu, even when it reaches for abstraction.

Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative distance stays steady.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits both setting and Elena’s reflective mindset. Diction and imagery recur in a patterned way (bunkers, crystals, shells, radiance) that feels intentional rather than mechanical. The brief text-message exchange is understated and believable, providing contrast without breaking tone. There is mild sameness to the lyricism in places, but it doesn’t disrupt focalization or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly tethered to Maren’s worldview, with good control of interior/outer detail balance. Diction and metaphor (“daringly methodical interpretation,” “ivy cascaded like green water”) feel mostly organic to this character and setting. There is minor reliance on familiar abstractions (“healing waters,” “redemption existed”) that slightly flatten an otherwise distinctive texture. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent, comfortably within publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches the character’s sensibility and the fantastical setting, with controlled imagery and rhythm. Diction is consistent and confident, and the narrative distance stays stable; we’re always in her perception even when explaining the library’s rules. The brief spoken line at the end is simple and clean, offering a nice tonal contrast to the ornate narration. The prose occasionally leans into elevated phrasing, but it remains coherent and feels like a deliberate stylistic choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lush, metaphorically inventive, and tightly bound to Mira’s sensibility as a researcher attuned to objects, patterns, and living archives. Lexicon and rhythm remain consistent, with no head-hopping or stance drift, and the lyric tilt never loses narrative clarity. POV modesty is good: we only know what Mira can infer from stains, plants, and history, and the prophetic elements are framed as her interpretive gifts rather than authorial omniscience. The main limiting factor is that the high lyric register is very uniform; a touch more modulation under peak stress could sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tethered to Mira’s sensibility—her attentiveness, professional habits, and childhood training shape what and how she notices. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical frame and her reflective mood; there’s no register slippage or POV leakage. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentences lengthening into description during contemplative beats and tightening around key realizations. Even without dialogue, the narration maintains a distinct, character-inflected texture rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and distinct enough that Mira’s perceptions feel like a particular mind rather than generic fantasy prose. Diction and metaphors (“the vineyard hush of dusk,” “glass holds wine even when you cannot see through it”) are coherent and controlled. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying emotion and memory efficiently. There are no POV slips or register jolts; a bit more rhythmic variation at peak emotional beats could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and slightly stylized in a way that fits the quasi-mythic premise. The keeper’s worldview suffuses the narration—phrases like “moral commerce” and “conscience for hire” feel like her mental idiom, giving the piece a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural enough, with clear status dynamics and subtext (Sera asking if she’s selfish is about permission, not information). Psychic distance is managed smoothly, shifting between atmospheric description and close moral observation without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct texture (“river returning to its source,” “teaching absence to manifest as presence”) that suits the material. POV is stable and legible, hovering just outside Elowen while still coloring perception with his long study and backward chronology. Dialogue is succinct, natural for a contemplative fantasy master–student pair, and carries subtext about trust and pedagogy. Rhythm modulates appropriately, tightening around the trance sequence and easing into the reflective close.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in harmonics, echoes, and patterns, and it holds cleanly to Vessa’s sensibility except for a brief but tolerable omniscient glimpse of the traveler’s state (“young, frightened, desperate for purpose”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the diction feels aligned with an austere, quasi-mythic register without tipping into pompousness. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and the echoes repeating lines nicely integrate voice with world logic. Under pressure, the voice maintains control and doesn’t over-explain what the images already convey.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a confident, mildly elevated lyric register that fits both the setting and Mara’s contemplative mindset. Phrasing like “a thought without a thinker” and “brilliant dimness that made everything glow with uncertain permanence” gives the prose a distinct texture without drifting into incoherence. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between external description and internal realization without head-hopping or stance confusion. There is occasional abstraction, but it serves tone rather than feeling like expository scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Marcus-bound, with metaphors and perceptions (lamps, hush, light) rooted in his history and craft. Rhythm and diction modulate well between descriptive reverie and more direct narrative movement, avoiding both flatness and excess. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the few slightly elevated phrases match the quasi-mystical, contemplative tone. The voice feels distinct enough to be memorable while staying controlled and legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Mira’s scientific-mystical mindset, with a distinct lexicon (“contracting memory of spacetime,” “cast lots decision maker”). Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely between longer, lyrical sentences for cosmic description and tighter phrasing around key actions (coin casts, message reception). There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; the narration’s metaphysical certainty matches what this character plausibly believes in this speculative frame. A few abstract noun clusters risk slight distance, but they don’t materially harm control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility (e.g., seeing the crystallized monsters as “small enough to hold”). Diction and rhythm support the elegiac, contemplative mood and modulate gently as the scene moves from burden to a more luminous acceptance. There are no POV slips or register clashes; reflection and present action are balanced cleanly. The voice feels distinct enough for literary publication while remaining accessible.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close-third narrative voice is confident, cohesive, and textured, with a distinctive lexicon (“cosmic plumbing,” “patient mathematics of things that moved between states”) that fits Corin’s mind. The prose balances elevated, lyrical description with clear exposition of the magic system. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping in and out of mild omniscient framing without confusion. There are no POV leaks or register jolts, and the voice modulates gently with the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Martha’s sensibility, with good control of rhythm and image. Phrasing like “liminal hour,” “mirrored hush,” and “precisely humane” establishes a distinct texture without slipping out of plausibility for this character. Occasional overtly conceptual sentences approach essayistic, but they’re brief and functional within the reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual flavor rooted in an alchemist who is both scientist and mystic. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent and feel like an extension of Elara’s sensibility rather than generic fantasy prose. Psychic distance stays stable, with smooth modulation at peak beats (the starlings’ descent, the crystal’s transformation). There is no head-hopping or register clash; the only arguable limitation is that the narrator occasionally feels slightly wiser and more omniscient than Elara would be under acute risk.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits the quasi-mythic vantage point without drifting into purple. Vera’s perceptual signature—reading the world as patterns and procedures—is consistent, especially in how she touches instruments and data. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying status and stakes (Ash’s “Lives depend on your reading,” her “I will not lie to you”). A few phrasings (“attentively inventive focus,” “the truth the patterns are telling me”) feel a touch generic or writerly, but they don’t disrupt the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lucid, and consistent, with a measured, contemplative cadence that fits both Kira’s history and the philosophical SF frame. Dialogue is functional and distinguishable—Vex’s sharpness vs Sera’s caution—while Kira’s speech carries authority without slipping into pure lecture. Occasional omniscient-leaning sentences about timelines and Kira’s past are handled cleanly and don’t break focalization. The voice is controlled and pleasant, though it doesn’t yet have the level of idiosyncratic texture that would make it unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in Vera’s way of framing everything through design, flow, and transformation. Diction (“orthogonal approaches,” “storm-born silence,” “pregnant with possibility”) is elevated but unified and appropriate to a contemplative, somewhat cerebral protagonist. Psychic distance is well managed, moving smoothly between concrete sensory detail and reflective abstraction without head-hopping or stance confusion. The absence of dialogue avoids potential pitfalls and keeps focus on interior and atmospheric voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and confident, with a distinctive lyrical bent (“a throat that had forgotten how to swallow”) that feels coherent with Victor’s haunted state. Psychic distance is well controlled, dipping closer for key emotional beats and stepping back for compressed backstory without jarring shifts. There’s no head-hopping and no expository narrator over-explaining subtext. A few phrasings flirt with self-consciousness, but they don’t materially damage the POV or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent with a third-person close vantage on Maren, with good control of psychic distance. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate and support the foggy, suspended quality of the setting without losing clarity. Dialogue is natural enough and distinct in purpose—Maren is measured, the newcomer brittle and despairing—while mostly avoiding expository clunk. A few lines stray toward essayistic abstraction, but not enough to undermine the overall voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Maren’s disciplined, analytical mind under pressure. Diction and metaphor choices (“frozen bloom of light,” “still pond above churning depths”) feel internally consistent and character-compatible rather than generically ornate. Distance is well-managed, allowing close interior access without slipping into authorial essaying. The absence of dialogue means we don’t see modulation across speakers, but within its chosen mode, the voice is strong and sure-footed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a persuasive blend of technical and lyrical diction that suits a “celestial signal interpreter.” Phrases like “serenely electric” and “cloak woven from the space between heartbeats” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance remains consistent, and we never slip out of Mira’s perceptual frame. The modulation under pressure is modest—more contemplative than urgent—but controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with strong rhythm and a distinct perceptual signature anchored in Mara’s sardonic resilience. Brief dialogue is in-character and functional, and the narrative never drifts into an omniscience that breaks focalization. The metaphorical register (“time was not a river but a net,” “voices layered like sediment”) is consistent with the speculative tone and does not overreach. There are a few moments that flirt with explanatory neatness (“she understood now”) where the voice could trust implication a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Marina’s educated, architect’s sensibility; her way of noticing is precise and conceptual without losing clarity. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with phrases like “realistically imaginary” and “negotiated back” giving the prose a distinct texture. Occasional abstract formulations edge toward essayistic (“Connection was not abstract, she had learned…”) but generally remain anchored in concrete action and image. There is no POV slippage or register drift that disrupts the line of thought.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited POV stays cleanly with Vara, and the voice is consistent, measured, and slightly formal, fitting a disciplined commander confronting awe. Prose rhythm varies well, moving between lush description and tighter internal reflection, and Tessek’s translated speech has a distinct, slightly alien cadence (“balancedly curious,” “edge geometry”) that differentiates it from Vara’s inner voice. A few abstract formulations creep in, but overall the voice feels controlled and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, consistent, and textured, with a distinct lyrical-quiet cadence that suits the material. Diction choices like “the building had been a sanatorium once, and its bones remembered sickness” feel specific to this narrative sensibility rather than generic. Dialogue is clean, natural, and goal-oriented, with clear emotional subtext in Margaret’s halting disclosures and Vera’s steady assurances. While strong, the voice doesn’t quite reach the idiosyncratic sharpness or rhythmic daring that would push it into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without purple, and clearly filtered through a professional who is both scientist and mourner.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct, restrained lyricism that fits Mira’s mindset and the nocturnal setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate well between description, reflection, and key emotional beats. The narrative never claims knowledge beyond Mira’s perspective and maintains stable psychic distance. There is no dialogue to test, but the interior narrative texture feels specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that favors texture and bodily sensation (“sand caught in honey,” “the weight of wet wool”). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to sustain atmosphere without feeling mechanical, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what the images already carry. The elevated diction feels justified by the character’s vocation as a storyteller and never drifts into alien register or unmotivated abstraction.

    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly colored by Maren’s scientific yet wonder-prone sensibility.

Samuel had become it.”). Occasional abstract formulations flirt with essayistic tone but remain within a plausible narrative stance. POV remains clean and consistent, with no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by Mira’s sensibility, with images (dust stirred in their wake, Archives of Permitted Sound) feeling like her way of noticing. Psyche-distance is well controlled: we move from tactile present to reflection and back without disorientation, and there’s no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but coherent with the fable-like, slightly mythic mode. A few sentences lean into essayistic proclamation at the thematic peak, but overall the voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical without slipping into obscurity, and consistently tuned to Marcus’s sensibility. Phrases like “linking absences” and “brittle hush” create a distinct texture, and the narrative distance stays stable. Dialogue is spare but natural, advancing stakes and revealing character without exposition dumps. There is minor risk of the narration feeling slightly more elevated than a working courier’s inner lexicon, but it coheres as a gently stylized narrative voice rather than strict interior monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct lyrical texture grounded in Marcus’s sensibility as a craftsman attuned to sound and touch. Diction and rhythm generally feel controlled and intentional, and the narrative doesn’t drift into omniscient commentary or head-hopping. Occasional abstract or elevated phrases flirt with over-articulation but don’t break the illusion of a coherent narrative stance. The modulation from lonely observation into charged, almost numinous intensity during the singing sequence is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well matched to a protagonist who lives at the intersection of science and poetry. Syntax and diction are controlled without feeling mannered, and focalization remains firmly with Eleanor while still describing patrons and environment. The narrative modulation—from observational to more incantatory as geometry breaks—is smooth and legible. It stops short of a truly idiosyncratic, unmistakable voice, but it is already strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical without being overwrought, and tightly aligned with Miriam’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are well controlled.

No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and the “luminous” tonal register holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a clear perceptual signature (cosmic metaphors, locksmith lexicon, attention to subtle emotional cues). Distance is well controlled: we hover near Mira’s consciousness without arbitrary head-hopping, and the brief omniscient touches (e.g., Elena three hundred miles away) feel purposeful. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction suits the mythic tone. At times, the narration abstracts (“the enveloped secrets of existence itself”) where a more Mira-specific phrasing would deepen character through voice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and colored by Elara’s sensibility as both scholar and granddaughter; it balances lyricism with clarity. Phrasing like “geometry of loss and searching” or “memories had been stolen gradually, like coins lifted from a pocket” shows a distinct sonic and perceptual signature without tipping into over-wrought. POV is steady, with no head-hopping or distance wobble; reflection is anchored in present stimuli and feeds directly into action. A touch more idiosyncratic quirk in her internal language under peak stress could push this toward exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited POV through Mira is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature—analytical, object-focused, and emotionally wary. Prose rhythm flexes well between description and dialogue, and the occasional elevated diction feels consistent with her role as archivist rather than imposed. Dialogue between Mira and Thessaly is natural, distinct in register, and carries subtext about past exile and present obligation. There’s minimal exposition-flab or distance drift, which keeps the voice feeling controlled and publication-ready.

    The narrative voice is lyrically precise with a distinct texture (“voice like wind through broken glass”) that fits the world and Mira’s perception. POV is stable and controlled, allowing limited access to Callum only through his manifestations and the rope’s speech without head-hopping. Dialogue is concise, purposeful, and subtextual, advancing both plot and theme. Rhythm and diction modulate well between dense description and cleaner, sharper lines at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical attention (maps, footage angles) and lyrical observation (“patient as prayer”). Diction and rhythm are consistent with Elena’s thoughtful, meticulous nature and support the accumulative, uncanny mood. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both atmosphere and interiority to coexist. Some lines run slightly abstract, but they stay within a coherent register and do not disrupt the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with an educated, scientifically minded protagonist who is also steeped in loss. Diction and rhythm are carefully modulated, with enough variation to avoid monotony and a clear perceptual signature in how Eleanor notices both technical details and metaphysical resonances. There are a few moments where the narration edges toward authorial essay rather than character-inflected thought, but they still plausibly fit her interior register. Overall, POV handling is confident and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctive, with phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “a figure made of light and longing” giving it a recognizable texture. Diction and rhythm fit Mira’s contemplative, craft-oriented perspective and stay consistent under the emotional peaks. There’s no head-hopping; even when summarizing the ghost’s past, the narrative stance feels like Mira’s reconstructed understanding rather than omniscient intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, fluent, and mostly well-modulated, with a gentle lyricism that suits the material. Mira’s perceptual signature—attention to light, ice, and others’ sorrows—comes through clearly. At times the narration drifts into explanatory summary (“She understood now that her years of service had been preparation”), which slightly flattens immediacy. Still, distance control is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or register shock.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inflected, and plausibly aligned with a scientifically trained but romantic mind. Meteorological terminology is integrated as part of her psyche rather than info-dump, and the prose modulates smoothly between technical and poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, polished, and well matched to a thoughtful, observant apprentice; diction like “constitutionally incapable of leaving mysteries alone” and “polyglot’s phrasebook” feels apt for her education and temperament. POV discipline is strong with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge, and the narrative distance modulates subtly between lush description and tighter focus as stakes rise. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, with some lyric sentences balanced by straightforward narrative. The main constraint is that the voice stays a touch genteel under peak stress; a sharper modulation into frayed or fragmented thought during discovery could add bite.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-calibrated to Mira’s sensibility, with recurring images (frost, light, clouds, driftwood) giving a distinct texture. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly avoid overreach; long, flowing sentences match the contemplative, mythic tone. There’s no POV leakage or awkward elision, and the narrative distance stays appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person on Elara is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that suits the material. Diction is consistent, and shifts in rhythm—from more luxuriant description of Veridian to plainer dialogue—feel intentional and smooth. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-marked (Marcus’s gruffness vs. Elara’s gentler tone). There’s minor authorial seepage in a few aphoristic lines, but not enough to destabilize POV or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically charged yet controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits Mira’s age, role, and the cosmic scale. Metaphors (“time’s final ripple,” “pane of hush”) form a recognizable lexicon rather than a grab bag, and psychic distance is managed cleanly. There is no head-hopping or confusing stance shift, and compressed exposition blends smoothly with present action. A few abstract phrases (“beautifully flawed existence”) lean toward authorial commentary but stay within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, confident, and well-suited to this slightly folkloric, slightly mechanical fantasy angle. Maren’s perception is practical and unsentimental, which fits her role and helps ground the more fantastical elements. Dialogue is sparse but believable and functional, and there’s no head-hopping or distance confusion. The voice is strong but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic; it could be more distinctively Maren’s rather than a generalized literary-fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrically inclined yet clear, and plausibly reflective for a scientist steeped in metaphor via her daughter. Diction and syntax show controlled rhythm, with scientific and poetic registers coexisting without major clashes.

Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext (Cassius “already knew,” her sandpaper metaphor) without exposition dumps. The narrative distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping. A few coined phrases (“sturdy brittle”) lean slightly toward writerly flourish, though they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, assured, and distinctively lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in sound and ritual. Diction and syntax suit both Elena’s vocation and the quasi-mythic tone without sliding into academic or overwrought registers. Her spoken phrases into the mic feel like incantations rather than realistic dialogue, but that suits the piece’s fable-like bent. The voice is very strong, though not quite so idiosyncratic or formally daring as the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Vera’s analytic yet visionary mind—phrases like “chaotically precise movements” and “calcified memories” feel of a piece. Sentence rhythm is varied and well-controlled, modulating between concrete description and elevated abstraction without losing clarity. The psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. A slight tendency toward high-register abstraction in peak moments is stylistic but doesn’t significantly harm the voice’s distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and character-specific, with diction like “prism-minded nature” and “threshold effects” matching an intellectually rigorous archivist in a fantastical world. The narration balances lyricism and clarity, and the lens through which she notices details (margins, absences, inks, geometry) deepens our sense of her mind. No POV slippage or gratuitous exposition intrudes, and the modulation as pressure rises to inversion then eases on exit is smooth. Occasional abstract phrases could be grounded in more sensory immediacy, but overall the voice feels polished and deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly attuned to physical processes of wood and sound, matching Maren’s vocation. Syntax varies well, with long, flowing sentences used for reflection and shorter ones to land key realizations.

The free-indirect distance works, letting us inhabit her thought-patterns while maintaining a slightly elevated register that fits her contemplative nature. Phrases like “imagination… was simply reality wearing a different costume” show stylistic confidence without breaking POV plausibility. Occasionally the register edges toward the aphoristic, but it remains coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature built around scent and an almost lyrical attention to texture. The few lines of dialogue (Thessaly) have a slightly heightened, aphoristic quality that fits the quasi-mystical setting without feeling mannered. Narrative distance stays consistent and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. At times the voice edges toward generic poeticism, but overall it’s controlled and character-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical without excess, and consistently filtered through Maren’s professional and emotional lens. Diction and syntax are well-controlled, with occasional striking phrases (“whirling silence,” “gathering of echoes”) that feel earned rather than ornamental. The narrative distance tightens appropriately around key beats (touching the arrow, hanging in inversion) without head-hopping or register drift. While distinctive, the voice isn’t so idiosyncratic as to be unforgettable, keeping this in the strong but not exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, intelligent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature: she notices wind behavior, structural shifts, and instrumentation in a way that matches her profession and obsession. Diction balances technical precision (“anemometer,” specific wind speeds) with lyrical framing (“vast, metal heart,” “labyrinth’s respiratory system”) without drifting into purple or breaking plausibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping in and out of thought and memory smoothly and always anchored in present action. A bit more rhythmic variation, or one or two truly surprising syntactic turns under peak emotional pressure, could push this toward exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in synesthesia and musical thinking. Moments of widened vantage (“Children would hear it in their dreams…”) stretch beyond strict character-bound knowledge but feel like visionary extension rather than sloppy head-hopping. Diction and rhythm suit the mythic, ceremonial feel of the scene. A few abstract phrases (“certified wonder,” “oscillating repose”) slightly thin the intimacy of the voice, but not enough to damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits an initiatory fantasy ritual. The perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices texture, silence, and ritual detail rather than generic scenery. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, atmospheric sentences and tighter action beats (uncasing, playing, revelation). There’s no POV leakage or needless exposition; the narrator’s confidence about world mechanics fits what Mira plausibly knows.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Mira’s conceptual bent (equations, asymptotes, ratios). Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, sustaining a high-register poetic mode without slipping into incoherence or register clashes. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the close third retains stable distance while allowing for occasional, fitting abstraction. The voice modulates well as pressure rises, from cool description to more fevered, musical lines around the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, coherent, and suited to a reflective, quasi-mystical fantasy tone, with clean handling of time and interior access. Diction (“germinates,” “permeable,” “resonating at frequencies”) is elevated but consistent with the world and Maren’s apprenticeship context. The prose has some rhythmic variety and a recognizable, calm lyric texture, though it doesn’t feel particularly idiosyncratic or deeply character-specific. Overall, it’s controlled and professional, if more polished-genre than singularly distinctive-literary.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyric-scientific texture (“emotional archaeology,” “silence relocated”) that fits an empiricist mystic. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative stance stays bound to what Elara can infer and perceive; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts. The voice modulates well between abstract reflection and concrete observation, especially when she reads the frost strata. Occasionally the register flirts with being more ornate or conceptual than her stress level quite warrants, but it never breaks plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature tied to weaving, thread, and pattern. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, slightly elevated register that fits Mei’s contemplative, craft-shaped worldview. Imagery like “threads of silence” and “become the message” feels integral, not ornamental, and the narrative distance stays stable. There’s no POV leakage or explanatory intrusion; the voice carries both the magical logic and emotional weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with controlled rhythm and vivid lexicon that suits the quasi-mythic SF setting. POV distance is steady and appropriate, blending close interior access with occasional broader, fable-like narration without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, especially the exchange with the crystalline woman, which carries both exposition and thematic charge. The perceptual signature—craft-oriented, attentive to weight, time, and patience—is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, gently lyric SFF register that fits both the speculative premise and Mira’s sensory vocation. Phrasing like “reality felt thin as membrane” and “stacked like pages in a book” gives a distinct, if not wholly original, texture. POV remains stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience—and the brief dialogue feels natural to the world and situation. The main ceiling is that the narrative idiom feels genre-familiar rather than uniquely tied to this individual consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly colored by a seafarer who notices weather, rust, and silence more than people. Lyrical phrases (“luminescent weight of strangers’ gratitude,” dust motes “like underwater creatures”) feel organic to that sensibility rather than generic prettiness. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between concrete perception and interior reflection without leakage or authorial intrusion. The quiet, slightly archaic cadence suits the haunted, long-memory setting and holds under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inflected without losing clarity. The narrator’s register—a mix of gentle mythic diction and grounded physical detail—matches the character’s age and vocation well enough to feel organic. The cadencing of long, flowing sentences against shorter declarative ones tracks emotional beats (climb, ignition, calling, descent). Aside from a few mildly expository sentences, the POV feels controlled and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that feels tuned to Senna’s sensibility. Dialogue is clean, natural, and subtextual, with the dye master’s lines revealing his history and beliefs without clumsy exposition. The prose rhythm modulates well between description, interiority, and spoken lines, especially around the confession beat. There is a distinct perceptual signature in how Senna notices vibration, light, and her heart, supporting a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the material; Maren’s perceptions feel filtered through both her practical maintenance background and her emerging sensitivity to sorrow. Phrasing like “dust and old starlight” and “mundane miracles” gives the narration a distinct texture without tipping into pastiche. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between external description and interior realization. There is no dialogue to stress-test, but the narrative voice carries the weight elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)

Rhythm and diction generally suit the solemn, mythic tone without sliding into abstraction, and the narrative distance is consistent. A few phrasings lean toward familiar lyricism (“like seeds in wind,” “pressed…with hungry patience”), slightly softening the distinctiveness expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a calm, lucid texture that suits Miriam’s hyper-attentive, interior life. Dialogue is natural, purposeful, and distinct in register: the librarian’s measured, knowing tone contrasts with Miriam’s halting admissions. The narration maintains plausible knowledge bounds and doesn’t resort to clumsy exposition; backstory emerges organically from her perceptions and speech. Rhythm modulates well between description, thought, and dialogue without disorienting shifts in distance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature: Mei’s way of noticing gradual change and small details saturates the narrative. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the lyricism feels controlled rather than purple. Occasional higher-register phrases (“heuristically gentle approach”) poke slightly out of the otherwise organic voice but don’t fracture it. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; POV distance is well-managed throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited/close-omniscient voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the scale and austerity of the setting. Diction choices like “quartz hush,” “frozen starlight,” and “luminescent dust” develop a recognizable tonal and imagistic register. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in stance. It stops short of having a sharply idiosyncratic, character-specific texture, but is nonetheless controlled and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and textured, with a good balance of lyricism and clarity (“captured stars,” “acoustic amber,” “curiously steadfast”). Diction and metaphor feel consistent with a noir-fantastical underworld and with Eliza’s observational bent, without sliding into omniscient commentary. Psychic distance is well managed: we stay inside her perceptions even when the narration grows more elevated. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-directed, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and deeply colored by Vera’s sensorium, particularly her synesthetic tasting of phenomena, which gives the prose a clear perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are lyrical but controlled, matching the contemplative, speculative mode. Dialogue is sparse yet carries conceptual weight (e.g., “weather chose them, not the other way around”) without breaking voice or sliding into clunky exposition. The slight omniscient-leaning turns (“She was known…”, “the world remembered futures that never happened”) feel like part of a unified, confident narrative stance rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Maren’s sensibility and the cave setting. Diction choices like “auroral glow” and “uncorked creativity” feel of a piece with the atmospheric prose rather than tacked-on flourish. Psychic distance is stable, with smooth integration of reflection and present action. There are no head-hops or stance slips, and the rhythm varies enough to support mood without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lucid, and textured, with controlled lyricism (“soap bubbles refusing to burst,” “cathedral of magnetic tape”) that feels true to Mei Lin’s artistic sensibility. Distance is well-managed, moving between close interiority and slightly more panoramic exposition without confusion. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register jolts, and the worldbuilding is folded into the voice rather than feeling like separate exposition. The main ceiling here is that the voice, while polished and apt, doesn’t yet have a truly unmistakable, idiosyncratic rhythm that would push it into the rarest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Maren’s attunement to sound and resonance. Narrative distance is steady and appropriate, and the absence of spoken dialogue fits both world and character. A few phrasings lean more toward authorial essayistic tone than tightly character-filtered perception, but they don’t break coherence. Rhythm and diction modulate well between descriptive calm and the charged ringing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently aligned with VERA-7’s hybrid synthetic/organic perception, yielding a distinct texture (“like the universe clearing its throat before speaking something terrible and true”). Diction and rhythm modulate effectively with pressure; the prose grows denser around the burn/miniaturization and then eases into a calmer cadence at the renewed-rituals ending. There are no POV leaks or stance slips, and the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. The voice feels singular rather than generic, with SF-specific metaphors that support rather than fight the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-close voice is consistent, controlled, and textured, with a measured lyricism that suits Maren’s curatorial sensibility. Sentences vary in rhythm and length without calling attention to themselves, and dialogue feels natural and clearly distinguished between the more plainspoken Mrs. Okonkwo and the more reflective Maren. Occasional omniscient-ish lines (“The neighborhood knew Maren…”) are integrated smoothly and read as stable narrative stance rather than leakage. Under emotional pressure the voice holds together without slipping into a different register.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in Marina’s sensibilities as both analyst and dancer. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between atmospheric description and reflective insight, and the diction is consistent and plausible for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited POV on Mira is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in physical work, salt, and light. Diction and rhythm are lyrically elevated yet consistent with the fable-like, slipstream mode; they rarely feel out of register. The brief dialogue at the end is simple, functional, and does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the mystical subject; phrases like “a careful blanket of quiet that absorbed sound rather than negated it” feel precise rather than showy. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and its absence. There’s occasional elevated phrasing (“terrestrially cosmic”) that calls a bit of attention to itself, but it’s infrequent and thematically apt. POV distance remains steady and credible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is steady, lyrical without drift, and distinctly colored by the narrator’s sensitivity to built spaces and small rituals. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and appropriate to a reflective, slightly uncanny memoir of apprenticeship.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that matches Mirabel’s haunted determination. Diction (“tragic radiance,” “spaces between official maps”) feels character-appropriate in a slightly elevated, SFF-literary register. Limited dialogue is natural and purposeful, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping or unexplained knowledge.

Diction and imagery (“ink the color of midnight,” “pearl twilight”) feel deliberate and of-a-piece with the quasi-sacred, reflective mood. Psychic distance is well-managed, slipping inward for key recognitions (understanding the key’s purpose) without losing situational awareness. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself has a distinct, memorable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with lyric yet controlled diction that suits Mira’s sensory-attuned perspective and the mythic setting. Phrasing like “the layered harmonies of intention” and “progressive disclosure” balances the mystical and analytical in a way that feels specific to her perceptiveness rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance is well-managed, slipping between external canyon description and her internal realizations without confusion. A few abstract terms (“webs of intrigue,” “progressive disclosure”) brush against a more academic register, but they don’t meaningfully disrupt voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical without drifting into purple, and clearly aligned with Mira’s contemplative, ritual-focused mind. Diction (“borrowed starlight,” “calcified into an old man’s silence”) is consistent and supports the tone. There are no POV slips or unmotivated stance shifts. It’s a distinctive, controlled voice, though not yet so idiosyncratically Mira-specific that it feels singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on patterns and hidden systems. Third-person close with a mild omniscient sheen feels appropriate for this quasi-mythic, reflective vignette, and the register is elevated but not incongruous with Mirelle’s portrayed intellect. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and key images (“orchestra of infinitesimal lanterns,” “a beauty that ached”) land cleanly. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the voice plays relatively safe—assured and polished rather than formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with diction that plausibly matches a seasoned investigator in a ruined world. Sentences are varied and generally well-rhythmed, and technical details like the Geiger counter and respirator sit naturally in the voice. However, the narrative texture feels competent more than singular; there’s limited idiosyncrasy in how Maya notices or phrases things beyond a handful of strong lines. The voice supports the story effectively but does not yet feel unmistakably distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent perceptual signature—Miriam’s mixture of scientific and mystical attention feels coherent. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence structures and well-placed figurative flourishes that seldom feel gratuitous.

POV remains cleanly anchored in Miriam without leakage or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the material, with a strong perceptual signature in its attention to sound and weathered objects. Diction and rhythm are controlled; phrases like “thin cry of wind” and “beauty too large for his chest” feel intentional rather than generic. There are no POV slips or jarring register shifts, and the narrative stance balances interiority with external detail smoothly. The main limitation is a slight sameness of elevated tone across all beats, with little modulation in moments that might benefit from sharper contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a controlled elevated diction that matches the quasi-mythic premise. Vera’s perceptions and metaphors (“fleshly ethereal,” “reality recognized the weight of what approached”) build a distinct tonal signature without head-hopping or stance wobble. The narrative distance stays appropriately tight under stress, and exposition is integrated smoothly into her viewpoint. A few abstractions and high-register turns risk mild overstatement but don’t break voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches Mira’s contemplative, patient mindset and vocation. Imagery around stone, ice, and slow processes creates a distinct perceptual signature without slipping into mannered excess. There’s no dialogue to test, but interior access and narrative distance feel stable and appropriate. Occasionally the narration edges toward authorial essay (“The revolutionaries had learned their method from the land itself”), but it still reads as coherent with her reflective intelligence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature blending clinical observation and lyric awareness of history. Phrases like “read these spaces like medical examiners read bodies” and “history pressed against the present like a bruise” show control over rhythm and metaphor without becoming opaque. The occasional technical/clinical register (“preventable death investigator,” “empirical observation”) fits Margaret’s training and doesn’t jar against the more poetic moments. Overall, distance and diction are well managed, though trimming a few explanatory sentences would heighten confidence in the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits a reflective priest and the contemplative setting. Sentence rhythm modulates well between descriptive stillness and brief, sharper admissions (“A man I failed.”).

There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the narrative confidence feels steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, playful, and philosophically tinged from the first line (“like a drunk philosopher contemplating existence”) and remains tonally consistent. Zephyr’s perspective feels distinct in its blend of technical awareness and irreverent humor, and the Boiler’s brief dialogue has a contrasting, grounded idiom. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, with a clear perceptual signature focused on gears, algorithms, and probabilities. POV distance is stable and effective, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)

Diction choices like “mechanical ghosts,” “algorithmic detritus,” and “digital fossil” create a distinct perceptual signature without tipping into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical without becoming opaque, and consistently aligned with Kira’s perceptions and priorities. Dialogue is spare but mostly natural, and the keeper’s more formal, reverent tone contrasts adequately with Kira’s clipped self-definition ("I'm a peacekeeper"). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip into unjustified omniscience. A few lines drift toward authorial essay-voice in the thematic declarations, but not enough to break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (time as stutter, sound of ice, attention to small objects). Diction and rhythm support the mood without drifting into anachronistic or jargony registers relative to Maren’s implied background. Occasional elevated turns (“windborne solace,” “conceptual fold in patience”) feel character-compatible given the reflective mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the sparse dialogue matches character function and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently omniscient, and lyrically inclined, with consistent diction and perspective control. Sentences like “grief was a kind of cartography” and “a portable shrine to unfinished gestures” show a distinct texture without tipping into opacity. The distance occasionally slides toward authorial essaying, but the shifts are smooth enough to feel like a unified narrative intelligence rather than leakage. There’s no dialogue on the page, so voice differentiation isn’t tested, but the overall narrative stance feels coherent and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct, melancholic texture that matches Marcus’s sensibility (e.g., “the hush of old videotapes left unwatched”). Reflection and present action are braided cleanly without head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction remains plausibly within this character’s contemplative lexicon. Rhythm modulates well—longer, lyric sentences in reflection; tighter, more grounded phrasing around concrete actions like arranging driftwood or writing on stone. There are no notable register slips or expository over-explanations to undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical yet disciplined sentences that match Mira’s contemplative state and the observatory’s rarefied atmosphere. Dialogue is clean, character-distinct, and often carries subtext; Yua rarely states things baldly without an image or metaphor attached, which suits her role. The narrative occasionally leans toward a slightly more omniscient, oracular register, but it remains consistent in stance and rhythm. Psychic distance shifts (from external observation of Yua’s hands to Mira’s internal ache) are smooth and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)

Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose alive, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the narration drifts into essayistic abstraction, but not enough to disrupt the POV’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and gently lyrical, with diction and metaphor that plausibly match an older, craft-minded woman who has spent a lifetime with stones and stars. The narrative distance stays steady, allowing both sensory immersion and reflective commentary without head-hopping or register jolts. Rhythm and sentence variety suit the contemplative mode, and the prose modulates to a slightly heightened cadence at key realizations without tipping into overwrought. A few metaphors (“zephyr bloom,” some formulations around forgiveness) are at the edge of generalized-poetic, but they do not break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)

Diction choices like “honeyed hush” and attention to small physical patterns establish a distinct perceptual signature.

There are occasional mild register lifts (“processed guilt,” “careful fiction”) that feel faintly expository, but they don’t fracture POV or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-calibrated to Elena’s sensibility, with controlled imagery and rhythm that suit the liminal setting. Diction stays coherent—elevated but not implausibly so for this character—and psychic distance is stable.

There is a clear perceptual signature in how she notices story-logic, hopes, and objects like the shell.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gentle, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative tone and Mira’s temperament. Diction is mostly precise and character-appropriate, with a good balance between the technical (brass gears, mechanisms) and the sensory/poetic (gold light meeting silver). There are occasional slightly generic formulations (“trembling with exhaustion and wonder”), but they don’t undermine the overall texture. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet consistent with Maren’s contemplative, craft-driven mind. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences that breathe more when reflecting and tighten slightly around the ritual action. The way the narration filters the world—objects as tools and symbols, time as something to be prepared for—is a clear perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with distinctive phrases like “shingled hush” and “earth remembered how to breathe” giving it a clear perceptual signature. Diction and syntax stay consistent with a mythic, reflective mode and never break POV with clumsy exposition. The narrative distance modulates subtly—wider for worldbuilding, tighter around her bodily experience with the loom and lamp—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s sensibility, with good modulation between descriptive density and direct thought.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to an introspective protagonist attuned to subtle sensations. Diction such as “glacial hush,” “noise-plague,” and “excruciatingly gentle strokes” creates a distinct sonic texture without breaking POV plausibility. Rhythmic variation between longer, meditative sentences and tighter lines at key turns (“But last night, something had changed.”) is effective.

Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with images like “warehouses…hollow as promises” and “twilight…serene upheaval” contributing to both tone and character.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility—botanical, tactile, and philosophically inclined. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between description and interior reflection, and there’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. Recurrent phrasings (“oceanic hush,” the way the harbor disappears in stages) feel intentional, pattern-building rather than mechanical. It falls just short of the very highest band because the voice, while beautiful, doesn’t quite achieve a singularly idiosyncratic cadence that would make every line instantly identifiable as this narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrically inclined, and consistent with Elara’s reflective, detail-attentive mind.

The occasional slightly heightened abstraction doesn’t undermine the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature—firefighter metaphors, volcanic imagery, cloud migration—and maintains a stable psychic distance. Diction choices like “kelp-drift peace” and “gracefully alert” are striking yet coherent with the established tone, and the rhythm varies well between longer, flowing sentences and shorter emphatic ones. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even abstract reflections remain grounded in her embodied experience and vocabulary. The lyricism pushes toward the ornate but rarely feels mismatched to her perspective or the contemplative situation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, well-matched to a cosmic, quasi-immortal protagonist. Diction (“approximates infinity,” “resonant reconfiguration of light”) feels like an organic extension of Veloris’s perspective rather than arbitrary ornament. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose fluid, and the narrative stance—calm, observant, quietly sorrowful—holds steady through the turns. There is no dialogue to test range, but within this contemplative mode, control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (craft metaphors, attention to pattern, stone, and text). Thomas’s dialogue reads in a different idiom—measured, slightly archaic—without breaking POV or sliding into omniscience. Shifts between description, reflection, and quoted speech are clean, with no head-hopping or register jolts. The voice rarely surprises at a syntactic level, but its steadiness suits the “thundering calm” tone.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Maren’s vocation and temperament; diction like “great mechanism,” “escapement,” and “wound spring” grounds us in her mind. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with long, flowing sentences for reverie and tighter ones for key decisions (“In that suspended moment, she carved…”). There’s no POV leakage, and the narrative confidence matches what Maren can plausibly know. It stops short of truly singular, risk-taking voice, but is more than strong enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and stable, with a distinct perceptual bias (gardener metaphors, attention to threads, graves, and objects left behind).

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative modulates smoothly between physical action and reflection. A touch more compression in the most abstract sentences could sharpen the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, reflective, and particular to an analytical yet imaginative mind; occupational detail (probability wheels, trade-route extrapolation) feels organic to her perspective. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, avoiding register clashes. The narrative occasionally edges toward an essayistic tone in thematic sentences but remains anchored in Mira’s worldview rather than sliding into generic authorial lecture. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits Helena’s sensibility as a former copyist and clandestine storyteller. Diction (“thistled calm,” “story famine,” “Silence Decrees”) creates a distinct perceptual signature without slipping into self-conscious ornament, and distance is well modulated between external action and interior tilt. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative’s calm, measured tone holds even under minor spikes of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a clear perceptual signature: Marina notices light, distance, and partial images in ways that reflect her craft and grief. The diction is lyrical but not overwrought, and psychic distance is well controlled—zooming in on tactile details (charcoal, shards, warmth of the mask) and out to conceptual reflections when appropriate. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty matches what Marina can plausibly infer. The rhythm modulates effectively, slowing at key emotional beats like the scattering and the heartbeat-like pulse of the vanishing point.

Occasional omniscient-leaning commentary fits the reflective, literary register and doesn’t confuse POV. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and sustained without slipping into generic narrator or committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive sensory emphasis befitting a chef who tastes memories.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Marina’s way of noticing—phrases like “streetlights daydreamed their amber glow” feel character-specific rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is well-controlled, with smooth shifts between external description and interior reflection. Diction and syntax are sophisticated but not implausible for this focalizer, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. The voice modulates gently rather than sharply under “pressure,” but that suits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice anchored in Veris (with readable access to Mira’s surface thoughts via telepathy) is controlled and distinctive, with a calm, ancient, slightly formal cadence that suits a millennia-old statue. Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mythic frame, and psychic distance shifts smoothly, especially as Mira’s panic spikes then settles. The telepathic dialogue is handled cleanly and advances both plot and emotional stakes. There’s minor convergence into more generic “literary” abstraction at the end, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending mathematical lexicon with lyric perception in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. The narration maintains consistent distance and plausibility for someone whose worldview is filtered through proofs and probabilities.

Lyric touches (“her spirit sinking into memory even as her body climbed”) generally feel motivated and do not break POV plausibility. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent, and the lone spoken line (“Mama”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits the contemplative SF tone. Mira’s perceptual focus (thermal display, constellations, mechanical details) grounds the narration in her expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice on Marcus is steady, with a clear perceptual filter that favors patterns, codes, and contradictions, befitting a former con artist. Prose rhythm is controlled and flexes well between description, interiority, and dialogue.

Exposition is folded into the narration cleanly, and the narrative distance remains consistent without head-hopping.

A touch more idiosyncratic perceptual texture from Maren herself could further distinguish the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism (“like thoughts through a dreaming mind”) that feels consistent with Meren’s worldview and the story’s speculative register. POV is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the narration modulates gracefully between description, interiority, and summary.

    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses weather, memory, and ideology in Elena’s gaze. Diction and cadence feel appropriate to a poet under pressure—elevated but not implausible for her character. The narrative distance is stable, and reflective passages stay rooted in concrete stimuli (timer, envelope, photograph). There is occasional risk of the author’s voice peeking through in abstract formulations, but it doesn’t fracture POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close with a slightly elevated, almost mannered diction suits the philosophical-steampunk milieu and stays consistent. Elara’s perceptions anchor the narration, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)

Psychic distance is managed well, allowing both atmospheric description and immediate emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Yara’s dual identity as scientist and islander (“empirically whimsical,” “luminous doubt”). The narrative distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between sensuous description and interior reflection without confusion or head-hopping. Diction remains coherent and does not slip into jarring registers, despite the occasional abstract phrase. It’s strong, memorable voice work, if not quite distinctive enough to feel utterly singular at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and filtered believably through Mei’s sensibility, with Mr. Tanaka’s speech rhythm and restraint clearly distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative and slightly lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. The POV stays firmly with Mira, blending technical competence with wonder, though the insertion of prompt phrases occasionally stiffens the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately gothic, but occasionally leans on melodramatic stock phrasing ("whatever gods," "breath life into dead notes"). These choices create a generic "storyteller" distance rather than intimate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice balances scientific precision with mythic weight ("swallowed truth," "measured extinction") without slipping. The psychic distance is controlled, maintaining intimacy with Cassandra’s burden while observing the world with appropriate oracular detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, suiting the atmospheric intent perfectly. However, the heavy use of filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew," "she felt") and the distancing effect of the habitual aspect ("would burrow") keep the reader at arm's length, preventing full immersion in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into sentimental abstraction. Dialogue often sounds like written prose, serving thematic exposition rather than character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent, suiting the melancholic post-apocalyptic tone. Narrative distance is generally stable, though the text occasionally relies on summary ("Maren understood displacement") rather than immersing the reader in the realization process.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is precise, authoritative, and consistent, perfectly matching the "pattern recognition" mindset of the protagonist. The distance is controlled effectively, moving from detached observation to intimate reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable tone of solemn urgency. The primary flaw is the dialogue's "speech-act" quality, where characters speak in perfectly formed thematic paragraphs during a life-or-death struggle, breaking the illusion of immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly attuned to the protagonist's contemplative state. Psychic distance is managed expertly, moving from the physical sensation of the cold glass to deep memory and back to the immediate epiphany. The tone remains consistent even as the story shifts between observation and philosophical insight.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, managing the blend of mystical and technical terms ("procedural generation") reasonably well. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("hurt to witness," "impossible instant").

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is generally consistent, maintaining Marina's focus on visuals and vibration. However, the narrator briefly steps outside her constraints to describe Elias's movements as "audibly muted to anyone who could hear," which distances the reader from her lived experience. The voice is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately atmospheric. The third-person limited perspective stays close to Mira’s internal state without leaking. The transition from observation to resolution is handled with a steady, lyrical tone that fits the character's meticulous nature.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately wistful, though it relies on filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience. The point of view remains stable, but the tone struggles to rise above a standard melancholic register.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, frequently summarizing emotional states with poetic abstraction. Control of narrative distance fails in the final paragraph, where the limited POV inexplicably leaps to an omniscient perspective of a dead man to validate the theme. This breach undermines the story's groundedness.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, suiting the subject matter. The narrative distance is controlled. A few phrases drift into clinical description ("acoustically perceptive") which slightly jars against the otherwise sensory-driven tone.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the atmospheric tone well. It slips occasionally into diagnostic labeling ("precise emotional frequency," "affectionate detachment") which creates a slight clinical distance during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but distant, favoring a fable-like omniscience over intimate POV, which creates a filter between the reader and the emotional stakes. The shift from scene to broad montage dilutes the narrative presence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and fits the fable-like quality of the tale. However, dialogue often functions as thematic exposition ("It makes you someone who gives form to feeling") rather than naturalistic interaction, and the narrative distance keeps the reader somewhat removed from Veren's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like elevation that suits the magical realism elements without slipping into abstraction. Control of psychic distance is steady, balancing the surreal environment with intimate regret.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "intellectual mage" persona. There is a slight overuse of filter verbs ("She knew," "She saw," "She believed"), but the tone remains cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is cohesive but overly precious, leaning on "writerly" phrasing ("groaned its acknowledgment," "skeleton"). The tone remains static, lacking the modulation that accompanies rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The POV is securely anchored in Vera’s perspective, filtering the magical elements through her botanical knowledge ("specimens," "veins," "milkweed pods"). The voice maintains a lyrical consistency that suits the magical realism genre without becoming purple. The shift in perception as she transforms is handled with controlled intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately atmospheric. However, the verbatim repetition of specific descriptors ("haggard awe," "wryly earnest") across the narrative voice creates a mechanical effect that disrupts the otherwise smooth poetic tone. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, which is a strength.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. It effectively manages the shift from suspense to wonder, though the "unseen forces whispered their approval" at the end feels a bit heavy-handed and externally validating.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative distance is excessive, relying on a "helpful narrator" to explain the character's traits and backstory ("Elena’s gift had always been...") rather than immersing the reader in immediate perception. This explanatory stance distances the reader from the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the magical realism mode, maintaining a steady atmospheric pressure. There is a slight tendency toward over-adjectivized phrasing ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic") that creates a layer of narrative distance during intimate moments.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, but dialogue often serves as exposition ("Your sister's memories didn't simply transfer..."). Aldric functions primarily as a mechanism to explain the plot rather than a distinct character.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but stumbles with the awkward, forced usage of "intrigue" as an intransitive verb ("She began to intrigue"). The tone fits the mythic subject matter but leans into abstraction over concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a lack of rhythmic variation, creating a somewhat robotic cadence. The dialogue carries subtext well, particularly in Mr. Chen's reticence, but the prose voice feels overly staccato.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mei's perception. It handles the sensory details with control, though it occasionally risks becoming overly precious ("air smelled of... patience").

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, somber, and atmospheric, fitting the "ghost" persona well. It maintains a distinct noir texture, though it occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("texture of memory") rather than staying grounded in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably atmospheric. However, the distinct voices channeled through the cello suffer from uniformity; the mother, colleague, and grandmother all speak with the same profound, sentence-perfect cadence, reducing character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, it occasionally slips into "telling" mode to explain character traits or social dynamics that could have been revealed through dialogue or action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently meditative and controlled, matching the "dawning hush" of the content. The shift from scientific observation to personal grief is handled with smooth transitions in psychic distance. The voice feels distinct to Elena's perspective as a recorder of endings.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on explaining the character’s wisdom to the reader rather than demonstrating it. The tone is overly reverent, creating a distance that prevents genuine intimacy or distinct perceptual signature beyond standard tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a "subtly confident" control that mirrors Maren’s own professional demeanor. The shift from clinical observation to the lyrical appreciation of the "ancient vocabulary" of the ice is earned and consistent. The close-third POV effectively filters the world through an editor's critical eye.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic distance appropriate for a fable, with controlled cadence and authority. The shift in time scale is handled smoothly. However, the omniscient perspective occasionally creates a barrier to emotional immediacy, observing the "seventeen souls" from a detached height.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly lyric tone that suits the underwater setting and the weight of history.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a lyrical but controlled register that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Milo’s experience of the "impossibilities."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the tale. The perspective remains firmly with Elias, though the narration occasionally drifts into heavy adjectival stacking ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "mournful elation") that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation directly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. Narrative distance is well-calibrated, staying close to Meren’s perception while maintaining the atmospheric scope of the canyon.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from "narrative certainty" that explains meaning before the character can plausibly process it ("understood... impossible timekeeper"). The tone is controlled, but the reliance on explanatory interiority distances the reader from the raw experience of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, effectively maintaining the nostalgic-futuristic tone. However, it occasionally leans into expository summary to explain the character's thoughts rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, managing the transition between the lyrical descriptions of the work and the sharp, tactical observations of the coup without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, fitting the dreamlike setting. However, it leans on filter verbs ("She recognized," "She understood") that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, balancing technical competence with lyrical introspection. The recursive "nested awakenings" imagery is handled well, though the meta-commentary on the phrase ("couldn't remember learning that phrase") slightly breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is competent but occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing. Dialogue tends toward exposition, sounding more like prepared speeches than natural conversation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. The distance is well-controlled, though the reliance on summary limits the opportunity for voice to modulate under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the fable-like tone of the piece. However, the narrative distance remains static, observing Mira rather than fully inhabiting her immediate sensory experience during the climax. The tone borders on monochromatic, maintaining a steady level of melancholic reverence without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical control that perfectly suits the protagonist's profession, using linguistic metaphors ("inadequate vessels," "syntax," "resolve into a chord") to color perception. The POV remains tightly anchored in Maren, filtering the world through her specific expertise. The transition to dialogue is natural, and the distinct "careful recklessness" of Elias's voice provides a good counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is polished, maintaining a consistent, slightly lyrical tone that suits the atmospheric setting. The shift from anxiety to resolve is reflected in the rhythm of the sentences. Perspective is firmly anchored in Mira's immediate sensory and intellectual experience without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the reflective mood. However, it occasionally slips into sentimentality ("small hearts," "songs we carry"), which slightly distances the reader from the raw reality of the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fabulist tone. The brief head-hop to the father (Track C/Mosaic) confirms the connection effectively but momentarily deflates the isolation tension built around Wren. The "intuiting" filter is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, filtering the world through Marina’s somewhat lyrical, astrological worldview. The voice is controlled and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, matching the protagonist's analytical nature. There is a slight tendency toward explanatory interiority ("She was a street performer, but not the kind...") that distances the reader from the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic register, but dialogue suffers from forced exposition to accommodate prompt phrases. Lines like "You will become spontaneously anchored" read as mechanical instructions rather than natural speech between a mystic and a desperate student.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and elevated tone appropriate for the protagonist. At times, the register drifts into flowery territory ("fingers of some vast and careful hand"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct to a glazier's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to the fable-like tone. However, it maintains a high psychic distance that keeps the reader observing the magic rather than experiencing the effort or grit of its creation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, solemn control that suits Elara's weary professionalism. The distance is well-managed, staying close to her perception, and the rhythmic cadence of the prose supports the ritualistic atmosphere without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and controlled, fitting the mythic quality of the story. However, the integration of the prompt phrase "forgiving yourself" creates a minor POV dissonance, momentarily shifting into a generic second-person address within the third-person frame.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and maintains a distinct third-person limited perspective. The tone appropriately matches the "ethereal" subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into slightly affected poetic diction ("patience of something that had already decided").

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is stable and Mira's voice is consistent, but the dialogue drifts into generic fantasy rhythms ("stubborn creature," "triply cursed"). The narrative distance is well-controlled, though the "endearingly feisty" descriptor is a breach of show-don't-tell.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative distance is frequently widened by filter verbs ("Maren understood," "she realized," "she assumed").

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, fitting the magical realism tone. There is a tendency toward slightly purple abstractions ("sunlight waited like a question"), but the narrative distance and control remain stable throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the "fable" tone, but it maintains a distance that relies on telling over showing. The focus on Mira's internal realizations ("Mira understood now") often substitutes for dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the archivist persona well. There is a strong sense of authority.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "shadow keeper" lore well. The dialogue, however, suffers from staginess; lines like "Your scars called to mine" and "teach suffocating to breathe" feel written rather than spoken, straining the naturalism of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent third-person limited perspective that filters the world through Vera's cynical yet hopeful lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies heavily on filter verbs ("suspected," "understood," "sensed") that distance the reader. The tone fits the literary aim but occasionally veers into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.5)
    The mythic, fable-like voice is generally consistent but suffers a sharp register break with the phrase "factually mystical," which reads as modern analysis rather than immersive POV. The narrative distance is otherwise appropriate for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, reflective, and suitably melancholic, fitting the archivists' perspective. It leans into a standard "literary" register ("reverent fingers," "vanish entirely") that feels polished but occasionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and clear but adheres strictly to standard YA dystopian conventions without a unique perceptual signature. The narrative distance remains safe, observing Mira's competence rather than inhabiting her stress.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality of the setting. Interiority is well-managed, though the transition to the transformed state relies slightly on abstract summary rather than embodied perception.

    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and abstract ("mechanical meditation," "nodes in a network"), often telling the reader what to feel. This high register creates distance from the character's immediate physical reality and lowers narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and polished but leans toward sentimentality ("umbral tenderness," "weep without understanding why").

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is generally polished and atmospheric ("searing reverie"), fitting the solemn tone. However, it occasionally slips into clunky diagnostic phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped") that distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is polished and fits the fable mode, maintaining a consistent distance until the ending. However, the resolution relies on an unmotivated shift to omniscience ("The former inhabitants felt it") that violates the established limited perspective to force closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is generally consistent and elevated, fitting the "venerable scribe" archetype. However, the transition "Via a curious third-grade field trip memory" is syntactically clunky and breaks narrative immersion, reading like a synopsis note. This clumsy pivot disrupts the otherwise smooth narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the contemplative tone. However, the poetic distance creates a filter that describes the character's profundity from the outside rather than inhabiting her specific, gritty experience.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the mythic quality of the premise. While effective, it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("terrible soundless way") that distances the reader from the immediate reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The contemplative, lyrical voice suits the material and maintains a consistent psychic distance. The delivery of the world-building (the Reformation) is slightly expository and detached in the opening, reading more like a summary than immediate character experience, but the tone recovers during the interaction with the capsule.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, but it suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome" during the climax, explaining the realization instead of showing the cognitive process. The shift from observation to omniscient-style assertion about alien intent creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent melancholic distance that suits the protagonist’s isolation. The control of psychic distance is excellent, zooming in on the "wrinkled" seeds and pulling back to the "narrow vastness" without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a high fantasy piece. However, the tone leans heavily on simile ("like ash," "like funeral shrouds," "like untended wounds," "like luminescent ichor"), which occasionally creates a dense, slightly purple texture that distances the reader from the immediate action.

The control of psychic distance is steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The contemplative voice aligns well with the philosopher protagonist. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") and internal summary ("suddenly she understood") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly filtered and distant, relying on a "lullaby" tone that dampens the immediacy of the character's pain.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the synesthetic filter well, preventing it from becoming a gimmick. The perspective remains close to Mira, effectively limiting information to maintain suspense until the reveal of the piano's mechanism.

    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for a titan ("mourning veil," "eternal dance"). The distance is appropriate, though at times it leans into abstraction rather than immediate sensory experience. The perspective remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and earnest, fitting the "stargazer" archetype, though it leans heavily on explanatory interiority. The use of "awkwardly confident" as a direct label rather than a demonstrated trait disrupts the otherwise lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the use of filter verbs ("Marlowe understood," "Marlowe realized") at pivotal moments distances the reader from the character's cognitive leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, melancholic, and precise, suiting the noir-adjacent genre perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is competent and stable but relies on standard expository patterns to convey backstory and emotion. Dialogue is functional but stilted, serving primarily to explain the plot ("I'm here to read journals") rather than revealing character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism tone. However, it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("instrument of pure air") and relies on repeated phrasing ("luminous disbelief" appears twice as a label) that breaks the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a "polished calm" that mirrors the protagonist’s demeanor. The distinct perceptual signature—viewing business through the lens of highway robbery—adds texture. The control over psychic distance during the time jumps is skillful.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward melodramatic filtering ("echoed through Mira's bones") and breathless exposition. Narrative distance collapses in the final third to accommodate the didactic summary of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical distance that suits the "honeyed hush" atmosphere. The POV filter is rigorous, ensuring all observations—from the server racks to the moth—reflect Mira's specific emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and gentle, suiting the fable-like tone. However, the filtering of realization ("she realized," "she recognized") creates unnecessary distance in moments that should be immediate and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a lyrical tone appropriate for the mythic subject matter. The POV remains firmly anchored in Maren’s experience. The tone manages the shift from the cold reality of the crater to the magical release effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative tone of the piece. The shift from technical description ("tumblers," "escapement") to the sensory release of the echoes is handled with controlled modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the mythic tone, with a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative distance is well-controlled, though the phrasing "boundary-lessly trapped" reads as a momentary rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent melancholic but sturdy tone that fits the protagonist perfectly. Psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Marguerite’s perception. The transition between the memory of Viktor and the present action is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent melancholic and reflective tone that suits the setting. The distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Mira’s internal landscape while managing the external dialogue with the ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative, but relies heavily on filter verbs ("she could hear," "she thought") that distance the reader. The tone leans into melodrama ("cathedral of forgotten departures") that tells the reader how to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but repetitive, echoing specific descriptors ("glacial hush," "excruciatingly gentle") in a way that feels mechanical rather than rhythmic. The tone fits the introspective nature of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but leans into "writerly" abstraction and high-density metaphor that occasionally distances the reader. The tone holds, but the reliance on the letter for the emotional peak flattens the POV's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, meditative control that suits the "oceanic hush" of the piece. While slightly elevated and precious in moments ("reverent hands"), it avoids head-hopping and sustains the specific mood from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic. It effectively manages the transition between the physical garden and the imagined presence of the brother, maintaining a stable psychic distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, drifting into poetic abstraction ("patient as forgiveness," "deep as the years"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "gracefully alert" disrupts the narrative flow, calling attention to the construction rather than the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable register that suits the material. Narrative distance is stable, though the reliance on explanatory labels for the protagonist creates a slight filter between reader and character.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic distance but often resorts to "telling" emotions via adjectives ("troubling serenity," "terrible precision"). This creates a barrier to intimacy, keeping the emotional stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies on stacked similes ("like rivers, like flight patterns, like the roots") and familiar "poetic" descriptors that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened, atmospheric register that suits the solitary, regret-filled protagonist. There is a strong sense of perception, though the narration occasionally slips into an over-explanatory mode that undercuts the intimacy of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "weaver" motif, but it occasionally slips into purple prose ("visual music," "cathedral of stars") that distances the reader. The tone holds, but the register feels slightly elevated for a gardener's POV.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative and slightly elevated tone that suits the subject matter. There is a tendency toward filtering ("Mira understood," "Mira suspected") that creates unnecessary psychic distance during what should be intimate moments of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated tone that fits the storyteller persona. The shift in focus to the villagers ("blacksmith," "children") creates a slight head-hopping effect that dilutes the primary POV's immediacy, though it serves the concept of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elegiac control that suits the magical realism genre perfectly. The shift in perception when Marina dons the mask—where the gallery "breathes"—is handled with a distinct textural change that reinforces the POV's immersion in the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but creates unnecessary distance through filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "he could hear"). The tone matches the contemplative subject matter but often slips into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled. A minor slip occurs in the dialogue, which occasionally sounds like written prose or thematic explication (e.g., "The program is ending. There's a difference") rather than natural spoken rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lyrical, fairy-tale voice is mostly consistent but shatters with the intrusion of the required scientific jargon ("synaptic plasticity"), which clashes violently with the established magical realism tone. The narrative distance is stable, but the register break at the climax disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent and the voice is competent, though it occasionally leans into melodrama ("truth insisted upon it"). The narrative distance is stable, but the internal monologue often serves to explain the plot rather than reveal distinct character psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and introspective, matching the protagonist's "noticer" persona. While effective, the narration occasionally slips into over-explanation of the character's internal state instead of trusting the imagery to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative suffers from unanchored POV shifts. It begins firmly with Veris but drifts into Mira's direct interiority ("she carried something more precious now," "Mira looked around") in the final third without section breaks, violating the single-POV default and creating head-hopping instability.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the metaphysical subject matter ("terrible, generous way"). The control of distance is effective, keeping us close to Vera’s perception while managing the surreal scope.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, suiting the magical realism genre. However, it occasionally leans into "purple" description ("forgotten amber," "waxing moon struggle") and adjective-heavy phrasing that creates a slightly breathless, sentimental distance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elegant, and appropriately elegiac, fitting Mira's background as a museum guide. The shift into the "museum voice" at the end is a masterful manipulation of the established POV to serve the emotional climax. Minor dips into slightly purple phrasing ("throat of oblivion") are the only distractions.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and assured, matching the protagonist's obsessive nature. The narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to Alaric's perception while allowing for atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, gothic tone that suits the subject matter ("dead leaves scraping against bone"). The point of view remains tightly focused on Vera, handling the surreal transitions without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the material. The distance is well-managed, staying close to the prophet’s perception while allowing for lyrical observation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and well-tuned to the story's melancholic dread. However, occasional filter verbs ("she felt certain," "she realized," "she could see") create unnecessary psychic distance during high-stakes moments where direct perception would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic elegance that suits the "historian of fictions" persona. The transition from academic analysis to the poetic imagery of the ending is smooth, controlled, and distinctly voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a melancholic tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the psychic distance is sometimes too close to the authorial thematic statement, resulting in a "telling" of insights that should be left for the reader to infer.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately measured, reflecting the protagonist's precise nature. POV remains stable and focused throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, though it occasionally dips into melodrama. The psychic distance remains stable, but the tone feels somewhat generic to the fantasy genre, lacking a distinct, idiosyncratic texture.

    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic precision that blends scientific terminology with poetic observation. The shift between perturbation equations and traumatic memory is handled with excellent control, maintaining a stable psychic distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a steady tone appropriate for the "ancient tech" genre. It effectively blends scientific terminology with mythic resonance, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and maintains a steady melancholic tone appropriate for the subject. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though a few moments of filter ("found herself," "feeling herself") slightly dilute the immediacy of the perception.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dialogue is stiff and expository ("You taught yourself to read between the lines..."), prioritizing plot mechanics over naturalistic voice. The narrative often summarizes emotional states ("terrible numbness", "jaded wonder") instead of embodying them in specific perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like tone that suits the subject matter. The POV stays firmly with Mira, effectively filtering the experience through her knowledge and sensations. The distance is appropriate, allowing for both the physical immediacy of the transformation and the emotional breadth of the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately mythic ("accumulated weight of moments"). However, the use of filter phrases like "She understood now" and "suddenly she remembered" distances the reader from the raw experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, meditative tone that suits the "ghostly resolve" required by the prompt. While the expository block on shadow work disrupts the immersion slightly, the narrative distance and perceptual signature remain controlled and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. Phrasing like "wealth felt like walls and she wanted windows" establishes a distinct worldview, though the poetic register occasionally risks feeling aphoristic or distanced from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a suitable tone of serious intrigue without head-hopping. However, the reliance on standard fantasy phrasing prevents the voice from achieving a truly distinct or memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, maintaining a strong, distant atmosphere that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is controlled, filtering the high-concept world building through Meren's specific expertise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a poet protagonist. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "oxymoron made weather" and "shadow alphabets." The voice is distinct but risks becoming overly conscious of its own poetics.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and fits the "steampunk diplomat" genre, maintaining a polished, slightly formal tone. However, it occasionally slips into melodrama ("smile sharp as any blade") that feels more performative than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is confident and lyrical, fitting the poetic subject matter well. There is a slight tendency toward performative phrasing ("stars poured... like witnesses"), but the POV remains consistent and intimate, effectively filtering the world through Mira's reverent perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, matching the story's romantic, steampunk-adjacent tone. The POV remains firmly anchored in Elara's experience, handling the shift from observation to action with smooth transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira’s neutron-star lexicon—“spectral analyses,” “chitin architecture”—without leaking into authorial explanation. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, staccato fragments (“She knelt.”) under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice carries the entire melodic load; the prose succeeds in sounding like a scientist learning to feel. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied through gloved fingers and light-split vision.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical, furnace-warmed diction (“glass-sharp light,” “molten gold”) stays within artist’s perceptual lexicon. Sentence rhythm lengthens for star-wheeling contemplation, shortens for decoding beats—controlled modulation. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered through tactile verbs (cupped palms, smudged charcoal). Frost/ledger cipher taught and paid off within POV knowledge limits.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
    <comment>No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors (cathedral walls, molten gold) are spare, mixed only when pressure low, and never obfuscate action. High density: “numbers became names” compresses entire revelation. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with canyon cold and dawn acceleration. Clean copy—no tense slips or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is crystalline, compressed, synesthetic: “spectral fragments,” “silence lived here naturally.” Rhythm accelerates with short beats during strikes, then lengthens into the final cadence of acceptance. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: precise diction (“thermal sensors arranged in careful grids”) braided with lyric metaphor (“fronds like frozen lace”). No dialogue, hence no head-hop risk. Final hummed vibration is felt, not heard—textbook POV discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is undertaker-poetic: tactile, unsentimental, salt-stained. Perceptual signature sharp: “geometry bent like grief.” Rhythm modulates—long clauses for submersion, fragmentary beats for surfacing—without losing control. No dialogue to contaminate voice; internal monologue stays concrete. Elision (“seven nights—or what felt like nights”) is pattern-taught and paid off in disorientation that replicates Ezra’s.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays locked to Mira’s sensory filter: “salt winds that came too hot and stayed too long” is perception, not meteorology. Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, then fragments during the run—“They arrived in twos and threes”—matching breathless tempo. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong (“rang,” “unloaded,” “tucked”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Yusuf’s clipped suspicion versus Mira’s ancestral cadences. The final sentence’s quiet parallelism (“until the sanctions lifted, until the borders opened…”) feels earned ritual rather than drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is crisp: Mei-Lin notices halos of exhalation, inverted skies, jasmine glow—no tourist catalog. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to imperatives (“Breathe out…”) under pressure. Compression taught early (“pilgrim of sparks”) and paid off in final spirals. No dialogue contamination; single POV distance held. One clause drifts toward thesis-speak—“she had come to believe”—but is earned by prior pattern, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains psychic distance while syntax grows more elliptical under pressure—“like a sigh releasing”—mirroring dissolution. Perceptual signature is specific: a maze designer notices geometry that breathes, parallel lines that diverge. No head-hopping; garden remains external other. Purposeful repetition of “texture” threads motif without monotony. Distinct rhythmic control heightens final diffusion without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays inside Mira’s perceptual band—sound of boots, smell of rot, musical cipher decoded by touch. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under threat. No head-hopping; scout’s motive read only through gesture and silence. Occasional elevated diction (“staggering grace”) feels authorial but is brief and motivated by oratorical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Marina’s synesthetic sensorium; diction (“salt and silence,” “singing green”) is compressed yet precise. Rhythm modulates: long lapping sentences for kelp sway, then the staccato “thin and high, like a wire snapping” at climax. No head-hop; the mother’s interior is only hypothesized, preserving POV modesty. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyrical free-indirect prose mirrors Mira’s painterly eye: “sunset surrendered,” “luminous disbelief,” syntax elongates then compresses during theft. Perceptual signature stable—every noticed detail filtered through light-thief aesthetic. No head-hop; single POV remains intact. Rhythmic control varies sentence length to breathe under sunset awe then tighten during swap—no mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person idiom is consistent—slightly sardonic, poetic, steeped in glassblower’s fire/ice lexicon. Self-narration motif is signaled early and paid off when she titles her own prologue, justifying meta-commentary. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in calm, clipped imperatives at lever pull. No dialogue, so head-hop risk absent; perceptual signature strong (notices refracted light, silica dust, split leather texture). Compression like “contemplative glassblower removes her coat” teaches reader to accept synopsis-as-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Free indirect diction stays close to a stunt-performer’s sensory ledger—“spatial awareness, timing, sequences.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, clipped fragments under confrontation. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Dialogue sparse but carries subtext of ownership vs personhood.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to oracle perception; diction (“pebble-shore,” “ambered hush”) is tidal, patient, mineral. Rhythm swells and ebbs with star-loss, tightening into staccato gold-lines. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression is taught early (“tiny metallic fragments”) and paid off in the glowing map.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person tight to Unit-7 maintains perceptual signature: slow spirals, crystalline geometries, “simple act that felt revolutionary.” Syntax is metallic yet lyrical—“amalgamated their questions together into harmonies.” No head-hopping; human fragments surface only as filtered voices in the violin. Compression (“loops it could no longer count”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited adheres to Mira’s perceptual signature—echo-location, archival noticing, lens-mediated sight. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at the approach: “She stepped forward.” No head-hopping; Theo’s interior is accessed only through external gesture and Mira’s inference. Distinct idiom in “cataloging the final recorded words of those who had passed beyond speech.” Dialogue absent by premise; silence functions as indirection. Psychic distance modulates cleanly.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter—machines breathe, wings whisper, magnetic lines shimmer. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful repetition of “mechanically warm” and “sideways” to teach the lyric pattern. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk; technical diction (“holographic principles,” “resonance scanner”) stays within her professional lexicon. Emotional modulation is subtle but present—grease, trembling hands, dream of wings—without ventriloquizing non-POV minds.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Clara’s perceptual filter: “water damage had created images” carries her speculative awe, not omniscient fact. Prose rhythm mimics a cello line—long bowed sentences in the pit, staccato fragments when fingers numb. No head-hopping; Voss’s expression is always her interpretation. Compression is taught early (“not random patterns”) and paid off in the final disappearing face. The only hairline slip is one “should have dissolved” clause that momentarily leaks authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: meteorological metaphors grafted onto emotional states (“hollow as a struck bell,” “weather shifted without warning”). Compression taught early—“an oracle who could be wrong”—and paid off in final refusal. No head-hopping; Mira’s dialogue stays within Cassandra’s filtered ear. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is justified by Cassandra’s engineered origin.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is skeptic-mechanic (asbestos as “mountain air,” flashlight arcs). Syntax modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped appraisal beats, mirroring the shift from brooding to evidence gathering. No head-hop or register drift; “religiously skeptical” is the only slightly canned phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is unwavering—moss-softened spines, constellations of moisture—rendered in rhythmic, cadenced syntax that mirrors her loosening grip. No filter-verb stacks; every compression is taught by line one and paid off in the final river-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers close to Elena with therapist’s perceptual signature—selective attention to breath, root dreams, patient archetypes—never leaking into Maya’s head. Rhythm modulates: lyrical long sentences under eclipse hush, shorter exchanges during daughter’s admission. Dialogue carries subtext (“you’re doing that thing again”) and distinguishes generational idiom. No head-hop or register drift; voice coherence intact under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person stays tightly glued to Maren’s perceptual filter—“she listened to what the paper remembered”—with patterned diction (“bronze quiet,” “strange gravity”) that teaches its cadence early. No head-hop; compressions like “three seasons learning” are strategic, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is steady, essayistic lyric with controlled cadence; clause length mimics sweep of lighthouse beam. Perceptual signature—“silence and fog,” “minor chord of her abandoned spy career”—is character-bound, not writerly. No dialogue, so register stays consistent. Minor lift in final line’s spondaic beat (“Some lights guide ships; others guide the keeper home”) gives closure pulse without showiness.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited clings to Marcus with disciplined focalization; no head-hop. The cadence of rhetorical questions mirrors the loop pedal’s layering, so syntax becomes technology—voice and tool fused. Compression is purposeful (“decoration itself”) and taught early; payoff is the muffled echo that ends the piece. Diction stays ecclesiastical without archaism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains a lyric, slightly oracular register that matches the protagonist’s lifelong trade in compressed revelation. Sentence rhythm echoes spirals—cumulative clauses that loop back on themselves. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every image through synesthetic sound: sky “folds into itself,” dawn “spills like honey.” Compression tightens under exhaustion without syntactic fracture. Voice never explains its metaphors, trusting the reader to hear the frequencies.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-philosophical yet sensorily grounded: “rain-slicked stones reflected the strange luminescence” keeps abstraction tethered to touch. Rhythm swells and contracts with altitude—long, suspended sentences while airborne; shorter, weightier phrases on stone. No head-hopping; POV stays interior-third locked to Mira. Elision (“time no longer moved in straight lines”) is taught early and paid off in the final helical image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Marina’s perceptual filter: no sounds, only vibration, light-fracture, leaf-scrape. Syntax lengthens under emotional intensity then compresses at exit (“She rose on unsteady legs”)—rhythm mirrors arc. Elias’s signed dialogue is naturalistic, sub-textual (“You seek the filament of hush”). No head-hopping; camera never leaves Marina’s sensorium. Voice texture distinct: tactile metaphors, no auditory clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual filter—wind velocity, compass pocket—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under shock (“Read it twice…”). No dialogue, so voice carries via tactile diction: “paper curled tight as a sleeping moth.” Register stays within self-taught meteorologist lexicon; no filter-verb clog. Rhythm modulates effectively, meriting high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close stays inside Maren’s perceptual filter: mineral rain scent = locked door, resinous bloom = tear wave. Rhythm flexes—long sensuous sentences during inhalation, stubbed fragments (“Tears came.”) at impact. Lexicon of scent is precise yet never perfumery-catalog. No head-hop; Dr. Vance’s dialogue is filtered through Maren’s ears, idiom remains restrained, scientific.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature—synesthetic “starlight filtered like auroras with intention”—stays character-specific and rhythmic. Compression taught early (“texture, presence, the weight of moments”) pays off in closing cadence. No dialogue contamination; single POV maintains modesty. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction sneaks into narrative, but isolated; does not breach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every noun through chemical-emotional valence (“bergamot and vanilla and something heartbreaking”). Syntax lengthens under grief, then shortens at decision—rhythmic control without monotony. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Vera’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Narrative voice stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter: cargo manifests, clipboard smiles, “shrewd seaside” diction. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats and shortens during archive raid, mirroring intensity. No head-hopping; reported dialogue stays in her paraphrase, preserving distance. Filter verbs (“she thought of…”) appear but are sparse and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric, compressed diction—“land remembered,” “wounded with beauty”—is taught early and remains legible. Perceptual signature is Veren-specific: she sees light as “heat,” trees as “glass,” bodies as “almost-touching”; no POV slippage. Syntax modulates: longer cadence for crater vistas, staccato for sculpting motion. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic—“I shape reeds” carries subtext of identity refusal. Final paragraph’s luminescent ache is earned by prior pattern, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is tight: fossil-drawer’s eye notices “spiraling shells,” “feathered impressions,” then “shape of a completed cadence.” Rhythm accelerates with stacked clauses during cage release, then fractures into exhausted brevity. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Prose texture mirrors illustrator’s precision—lines etched, then fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual signature: stalactite drip counted like heartbeats, erosion read as “language,” glass eyes that “watched from her palm.” Syntax tightens under stress—fragments (“Not Theo, but not nothing either”) mimic breath-catch. No filter-verb stacks; even metaphor (“voice like wind through orchard branches”) is focalizer-apt. Voice modulation from obsessive calibration to quiet acceptance is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—dust motes, pipe metal taste, dialect decay—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under decision pressure (“She would place it…”). Metaphor controlled: “shadows pooling like spilled ink” teaches pattern early and recurs in lighter pen-stroke at closure. No dialogue, hence no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Free-indirect style stays close to Vera: “her weathered hands,” “inexplicably satisfied,” diction plant-biased (“silk from milkweed pods”). Rhythm lengthens during reflection, fragments under shock (“Green threading through her veins”). Filter verbs minimal; perception selective—she catalogues moisture, not brands. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests in interior syntax, which passes read-aloud ear test without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Mira’s perceptual filter: rain trails as compositional vectors, warmth of stones as bodily thought. Syntax lengthens under fatigue—“the haggard awe she felt watching civilization’s bones emerge”—then tightens at the encounter. No head-hopping; Theo’s voice is external and distinct, his diction weathered. Compression like “water wars had ended the old world” is taught by context and pays off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent—“colors she had never truly noticed.” Syntax swells and contracts with cave song and pulse. No head-hopping or register drift; lyric repetition is pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays latched to Elena; perceptual signature is salted, patient, catalogic—“cataloguing the fragments of ships and sailors who never returned home” tells us how she thinks. Syntax lengthens and breathes during archival acts, then tightens into metonymic compression (“the valve told her things”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One micro-drift: “she had learned long ago” momentarily abstracts rather than embodies the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Clara's perceptual filter: "analytically artistic precision," "topographical data as something almost beautiful"—phrases no one else would utter. Syntax lengthens when she theorizes, then fractures into short sensory fragments under awe ("The door swung open."). The punch's metallic click and the brass teeth biting bronze are felt through her palm; diction never exceeds her professional lexicon. No dialogue until the final two lines, keeping voice pure and avoiding register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: whale songs “settle into bones,” starlight “danced across blank pages.” Syntax lengthens during transcendent beats, shortens at decision (“She descended”). No dialogue to distort voice. Free-indirect style clean: “She understood suddenly…” maintains psychic distance. Minor register lift—“quantum threads”—is justified by Aldric’s idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is stable lyric-fantastical, diction tilted toward the numinous without losing clarity. Perceptual signature is strong: Vera feels light “that had no earthly origin,” thinks in spider-web metaphors. Rhythmic control peaks at the collapse: short clauses mimic crystalline shatter. No head-hopping; the one-line interior slip into Korvash is filtered through Vera’s interpretation, maintaining distance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person POV stays tight; perceptual signature—chemical perfume of death, alibi mathematics, anomaly child—remains consistent; no head-hop; diction stays within Maya’s plausible lexicon; rhythmic compression under stress (“He asked. I chose.”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mei’s perceptual filter—synesthetic taste of electricity, paper-maker’s mineral eye—never slipping into monk or customer mind. Syntax glides from lyrical long sentences to staccato note-taking (“Dawn 744 - 58.3 Hz”) that mirrors her cataloguing obsession. No dialogue, so voice purity is total; diction stays within her craft lexicon without sudden graduate-seminar lifts. The lamp’s flicker is described with the same reverence as cherry petals—cosmic and domestic registers seamlessly fused.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays pressed to her skin: “she felt it in her bones,” perceptual signature of rust-salt-metal. Diction is corrosive, tidal, maritime—“sodium-orange,” “corrugated canyons,” “bureaucratic acid”—never elevated beyond her lived lexicon. One near-slip: “she preserved it between two squares of glass” momentarily sounds curatorial, but the next clause anchors the act to evidence, not art. Rhythm swells and recedes with sentence length, echoing the tide without drum-beat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close sustains crisp perceptual filter: “her boots echoing against rust and silence.” Syntax lengthens under grief, contracts under denial—rhythm mirrors pressure. Figurative language stays within POV lexicon; no head-hop. Distinctive phrasings (“abandoned observatory…forgotten thought”) seed voice early and repay at close.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited holds tight to Elena’s calibrated scientific perception; diction (“orbital shipyards…blazed like fallen constellations”) stays within her professional lexicon. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, compresses during timed packet releases, mirroring emotional modulation. No dialogue to test, but interior voice avoids filter-verb staleness and sustains a mournful rhythmic cadence that peaks in “It was enough.”

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s sensorium; no head-hop. Syntax breathes with her rhythms—long sentences for exploratory touch, fragments when rotors click true. Diction stays within plausible blind mechanic lexicon; no decorative latinate drift. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: warmth-pattern, micro-hum, brass basin echo. Dialogue minimal but natural; merchant’s “anchor lifts at noon” carries subtext of desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature: cartographer’s diction—“atlas,” “coordinate,” “watershed scars”—threads every observation. Rhythm compresses under decision: paratactic “The ice held. The silence held.” mirrors breath puffs. Free indirect cleanly fuses with physical action; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue sparse, indirection sharp: “You make it sound noble” / “I make it sound necessary.” No head-hop; lens steady.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains hushed, ritual distance; diction of “frozen midnight,” “ghost town revival,” and “wild hush” is consistent, poetic, and never spills into exposition. Rhythm mirrors the tuner’s tread: long sentences swell, shorten at strikes, echoing the pattern being carved. No dialogue, yet voice never defaults to tour-guide; perceptual signature stays otherworldly and disciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marina’s perceptual lens; no head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under emotional pressure (“the memories were snarled…”) then shortens at ascent, mirroring breath. Diction remains within a deep-sea researcher’s lexicon; only “lonesome splendor” edges toward poetic license but is earned by cumulative mood. No dialogue, so voice evaluation rests on interior monologue, which avoids filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Milo with no head-hop; perceptual signature is strong—“honey-slow,” “birthstone no one wanted to wear,” “silence like skin.” Sentence rhythm modulates: longer accumulative clauses for density, then staccato “He turned.” when void appears. No dialogue to judge; interior voice avoids filter-verb stacks. Register remains in a seventeen-year-old’s plausible range while still achieving lyric lift.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—cathedral of glass and iron bones—feels alchemical-lyric yet precise. Rhythmic control accelerates toward sunrise: clauses shorten, verbs strengthen (“cracked… bled… wept”). No head-hop; Maren’s interior accessed only through Elias’s reading of her face. Voice modulation under pressure: from reverent caretaker to overwhelmed witness, syntax mirrors breath-catching awe.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Meren’s perceptual filter: she sees moonlit water that never existed, feels “ancient breath” in stone, speaks of “phantom fishing boats.” Syntax lengthens in reflective paragraphs, shortens during sewing, mirroring breath. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; the prose itself becomes her idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: “patient fingers,” “warmly curious wonder,” tactile attention to copper wire and soil. Syntax elongates under awe, shortens under action (“She began to rebuild.”). No dialogue, so no contamination. One near-slip: “something older than memory” edges universal, but is saved by immediate bodily reaction. Voice is coherent, textured, and modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person hovers at Vera’s shoulder, perceptual signature filtered through patina, brass, ink scent. Syntax lengthens during transcription, shortens at mail-slot—rhythmic mimicry of task. No head-hop; diction stays within her antiquarian lexicon. Voice is unmistakably hers: “small poems, identities that contained multitudes.”

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira with perceptual signature—needle = compass, thread = star-chart. Syntax flexes from lyrical elongation to staccato mock-babble (“Always do, my lord”) without losing control. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect cleanly handled. Dialogue limited but differentiated: officers’ clipped conspiracy vs. Mira’s singsong submissives. No head-hopping or register drift; patterned elision (“syllables she collected like scattered pearls”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Celeste’s perceptual filter: rainspout edges “worn smooth,” moonlight “impossibly bright.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into the single-word whisper. No head-hopping; spirits’ dialogue is filtered through her chest vibration. Voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person-deep POV stays stable; no head-hopping. Voice texture is translator-specific: “languages tanched together like fishing nets,” “brain coral fragment … salvaged from a reef destroyed during a naval skirmish”—diction precise, maritime, professional. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences under anesthetic give way to staccato questions between the pair, mirroring slowed then sharpened attention. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: “You understand it” carries accusation and relief in four words.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric-omniscient stays consistent, focalization tight to Mira’s perceptual quirks—“light flowed…like exposed film.” Syntax lengthens during creation beats, contracts at the surprise laugh, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; neural-network whispers are still her filtered access. Diction remains painterly but avoids purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Narrative voice carries scholar-rogue perceptual signature: “charming smile that had talked him out of three expulsions,” “angles & escape routes.” Syntax modulates—compressed when surveillance is near, expansive when describing insect choruses. Free indirect clean: “Time is the one thing they haven’t figured out how to tax yet.” Dialogue indirection is present (“Show me the alphabet”) but limited; more subtext would have nudged higher. No head-hopping; distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Minerva’s perceptual filter—calcium dust, algae glow, cracked singing. Syntax lengthens and softens during lullaby passages, then contracts into chiseled declarations (“Beauty was not a place…”). No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the diction never drifts into abstract therapy-speak. The lyric repetitions (“tonight, as every night”) are pattern-taught early and pay off in the final cadence, giving the prose a sung quality that mirrors content.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is dense, lyrical, syntactically varied—“sugar in time’s indifferent waters”—and remains inside Mira’s lexicon and perceptual bias. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Pattern-taught metaphor chain (foxglove, calcified hope, copper pennies) pays off in final orchid bloom. Psychic distance tightens under ritual precision then widens into wonder; compression during climax (“impossibly, beautifully”) matches emotional surge. Distinct perceptual signature achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s perceptual signature—linguist synapses firing at dead phonemes—remains consistent and specific: “symphonies of truth hidden in ancient syntax” is eloquent yet plausible for her training. Syntax modulates with pressure: short, paratactic clauses during the first admission (“You came.” “You asked.”) then elongates as they settle into joint translation. No head-hop; Elias’s interiority is read only through his voice and touch. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual, e.g., “That sounds terrifying” carries the micro-turn of willingness to keep listening.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Mira’s machinist lexicon: stone breathes, machines sleep, adhesive ages in amber-to-violet spectra. Rhythm accelerates during decoding, then lengthens into resolved calm as she climbs out. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is chosen for tactile precision. The single POV never leaks; even Elara’s voice arrives only as ciphered artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyrical, controlled third-person single POV; perceptual signature filters world through avian motion and attic light. Syntax mirrors breath: long clause for circling motes, abrupt stop for meteorite burn. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but narration stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (no direct scandal recount) is taught early and paid off in confession beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; refraction-whispers and wood-braille create a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the violet edge, longer reflective spirals earlier. No head-hopping; father’s tremor is inferred through Wren’s body. Register stays within Wren’s plausible lexicon of light and grain.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is strong: “shadowseam wonder,” “continental shelf dropped away like a sigh,” “liquid aurora”—diction specific to a stargazer who reads terrain. Syntax mirrors pressure: longer, clause-stacked sentences during descent compress into short, breath-aligned fragments at the spawn climax. No dialogue clutter; Theo’s two spoken lines carry subtext of invitation vs. self-protection. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt”) they serve emotional distancing consistent with her character.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—selective attention to texture, color, moisture. Syntax mirrors her recursive thinking: long accumulative sentences for transliteration, staccato fragments when seeds are noticed. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within her lexicon (“transliterates,” “sea-foam”) without forced lyricism. Meets 9+ gate: distinct rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is precise, cool, musical: “constellations like scattered chess pieces,” “acoustics of this place,” “astronomy and acoustics aligned.” Syntax is clean, rhythmic, never drifts into overture-purple. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“She watched faces transform”) they amplify her observer stance. No head-hop; psychic distance stable; diction stays within a self-taught street-mathematician’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person hovers at lyric distance yet filters through Selene’s dancer-perception: starlight “pooled,” gaps “observed,” verbs like “trace,” “spiral” echo choreography. Syntax lengthens during dance, contracts at burn—“Kira gasped but held steady”—mirrors breath. No head-hop; Kira’s interior accessed only via Selene’s gap-reading. Diction stays within coastal-priest lexicon: “lunar phase,” “salt and motion,” never academic. Rhythm controlled: soft sibilants for tides, hard plosives for stylus burn. Experimental elision (cosmic verse unnamed) taught early and paid off at inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elena’s glazier eye: light is “fractured,” fog is “painted,” beams are “fingers of some vast and careful hand.” Syntax lengthens and softens with mist, then contracts to clipped sketching motions at the end, mirroring the shift from expansive contemplation to decisive action. No dialogue appears; absence is harmless. Free-indirect diction (“her folly… her conversation”) remains in character, never drifts into editorial. Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive enough to reach the 9-band edge; only the single abstract phrase “noctilucent reckonings” feels slightly writerly rather than Elena’s own idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited retains physicist lexicon (“variable,” “equation,” “quantum entanglement”) without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in grotto calm, tighter fragments during light fracture. Figurative language (“contradictions like water in cupped hands”) stays within Marina’s metaphoric range. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct and stable through beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perception is filtered through Mira’s synesthetic bias—stone hums, light is “filtered,” diaries “curl.” No head-hopping. Syntax is rhythmic but controlled: longer sentences for archive awe, fragments for tactile beats (“She extracted them carefully”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Compression in the last paragraph is purposeful, mirroring sensor cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with syntactic parallelism that mimics breath-held ritual (“she worked in the hush… her hands moved… the painting guided her”). Perceptual signature is painterly: color, refraction, spectrum that shouldn’t exist—details only this narrator would notice. No head-hopping; distance stays steady. The elevated register is earned by the mythic frame; rhythm modulates from long incantatory sentences to the final clipped vanishing, achieving charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: “operatively gentle fingers,” “throat constricted around the words.” Diction remains within her exhausted diplomat register—no corporate drift. Rhythm compresses under torch-gutter breeze, then lengthens with dawn bleed. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Theron’s ceremonial stiffness versus Kell’s reed-whisper flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close sustains Eleanor’s lexicon of infrastructure and geology: “water rights,” “acoustic resonance,” “coordinate in a language only the dying earth spoke.” Rhythm accelerates under thunder, then breathes in bird-call clauses. No head-hop; perceptual signature filters every detail through her priorities—salt is map, egg is balance-sheet item turned relic. Compression taught early (“extinction in her palm”) and paid off at close.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Meridia’s skin, filtering every image through her bodily poetic: snow is “silver courtyard silence,” threads are “gossamer strands of light.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with the untangling rhythm, teaching the reader the pattern without exposition. No head-hopping; the collective voices arrive as overheard whispers, not interior invasion. Register remains sensual and slightly archaic, matching the Velvet House’s self-mythology while staying believable.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual sieve—calligraphy muscle memory, puppet-carver’s eye for carved faces. Syntax modulates: longer reflective cadences early, clipped sensory beats during puppet moment. No filter-verb clusters. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Vera’s journalist precision vs Marcus’s aphorist compression. Voice never explains what the dust image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature: “esoteric realist” diction, knot-as-language, wind-as-data. Syntax mirrors her tactile precision—short, corded sentences when lashing frames; longer breaths during cloud watch. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under butterfly arrival. Prose texture is distinctive yet never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elin’s perceptual filter; aurora is “memory refusing to settle,” rope hums “behind her eyes.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath-like rhythm, matching the act of braiding. No head-hopping; diction remains within her artisan lexicon of wax, fiber, and metal. Final cadence—“ice sang with names”—lands with resonant compression.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—“vine-draped bunker had waited seventy years” gives inanimate desire that mirrors her gift. Syntax modulates: long sentences for dream-flood, clipped fragments at seal-crack. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly bounded to her sensory field. Diction within POV lexicon; Latin tag is external text she literally fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is crisp, slyly lyrical (“truth required no gilded frame”), with astronomer’s precision in diction. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Syntax mirrors Mira’s taxonomic mind—parallel clauses cataloging stars, costs, numerals—yet loosens into longer breath at twilight. Filter verbs minimal and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistently at lyric distance, compressing centuries into breaths without head-hop. Syntax flexes with reality slips—fragments when gravity warps, elongated sentences when memory dilates. The POV’s lexicon of “cellular memory,” “between moments,” and “conceptual cost” is justified because the narrator is the sanctuary itself—an aware non-human witness. Only tiny tic: one “would” modal too many in the climax line, barely audible.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara; perceptual signature is artisanal—light is “caught,” frost “sings,” fog has a “pulse.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, fragments during breath sync, mirroring physiological shift. No dialogue, so voice contamination is N/A. Diction stays within lens-maker lexicon; no elevated register drift. Final sentence cadence—“the fog closed behind her, but it felt different now”—delivers Charged Poise with quiet rhythmic lift.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Mira’s quartz-eye whirr, climber-body filter, cathedral-as-vertical-garden idiom. Dialogue rhythm separates age: Petra’s clipped jabs versus Mira’s gruff tenderness. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Minor register drift—“conceptual integrity” in narration feels academic—but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature (“silver blossoms drifted upward instead of down”) is character-bound and rhythmic. No head-hop; purposeful compression (“between the first and last page”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder with botanist precision—“petals pressed flat from gardens that would never exist”—and flexes into lyric compression under pressure. The time-traveler’s voice is distinct: clipped, regret-tinged, future-burned. No head-hopping; temporal displacement is signaled through sensory cues (ozone, scorch). Rhythm accelerates into single-clause bursts as shelves shift, mirroring heartbeat. Closure retains coherent perceptual signature: Mira’s final line of root-speech reads as both surrender and conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Maya’s metaphors skew aquatic (“drifted like a forgotten promise,” “spoken through water”), tying to bay setting. Compression (“blissfully aberrant joy”) is taught early and pays off when decayed horses watch the reunion. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under stress—sentence fragments appear only at flicker moment. Dialogue minimal but voice-differentiated: sister’s softer, fog-blurred cadence against Maya’s imperative pleas.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays latched to Mira; perceptual signature is curator-precise (“catalogued every entrance,” “filing system she hadn’t yet decoded”). Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during tactile work—rhythmic control without monotony. No head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is strong: cave textures are felt through Vera’s ripple-marked skin, light is “softened to a pale glow,” silence is “pregnant.” Rhythm modulates from groaning caves to final hush-cadence without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to evaluate. POV remains tight third with no leakage; inference is modest and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Perceptual signature favors synesthetic physicality (“frequency in her teeth”). Prism, star charts, and moth-eaten velvet are noticed through her custodian bias. Prose is lyric yet syntactically varied; no template cadence. One line of疑似 thesis-speak (“coincidences were the universe’s grammar”) is forgivable because it is internalized as her culminating synthesis and immediately embodied by the beacon blaze.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual signature—she clocks distances by lung capacity, color by emotional valence, gravity by how hard her pulse knocks. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer, breath-stacked clauses aloft, then staccato landing. No dialogue appears; the absence is purposeful, letting hush itself speak. Filter verbs are sparse and earned (“she felt it absorb”), never damping immediacy.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
    <comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses: elastic sentences during inversion, crisp fragments on touchdown. Metaphors stay physical—“silence tasted like possibility”—and never clog high-stakes beats. One scaffold loop (“silence tasted like…”) repeats three times; each reprise adds a new flavor layer, so the pattern pays rather than dulls. Only minor paraphrase in “she had come here to collect silences / she wanted the other kinds” costs a sliver of density.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature fuses maritime engineer and mourning mother: cables “sing,” silence “presses like a living thing,” vial crystals form a “staircase ascending toward nothing.” Diction stays within Eris’s technical lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm breathes with gondola drift then tightens at brake-release, mirroring her pulse under decision.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Meridia’s perceptual signature—cataloguer’s diction, circuitry metaphors, color-precision. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure: “She climbed as the sky brightened.” Rhythm accelerates across paratactic clauses mirroring ascending stairs. Filter verbs absent; sensory verbs are strong: “coated,” “fractured,” “shimmered.”

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: ash, starlight, ritual cadence, anatomical precision (“constellations across her arms”). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hop. Compression (“timber by timber”) and lyric elongation (“permeable as grief”) modulate with emotional tempo. Dialogue carries subtext: “Your scars called to mine” implies both accusation and plea. Register stays within Mira’s wounded-poet lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“shadowseam,” “multilevel vegetables”—is character-specific, wry, precise. Rhythm accelerates into sentence fragments during dimensional flood (“The pressure was immense…”) then steadies, mirroring Vera’s anchoring tactic. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on interior metaphor; “shame compressed into clarity” is fresh, not template. Filter verbs absent; perception filtered through tactile cues (oxidized brass, glowing gills).

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited remains fused to Margaret’s perceptual filter: “amber light pooled like honey” is her momentary metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens then fragments as attention unfocuses into intuition, mirroring the platter’s deceleration. No head-hopping; grandmother’s consciousness is inferred only through Margaret’s interpretation. Voice is distinct without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; syntax tilts toward liturgical cadence that suits the numinous turn. No head-hop; perceptual signature (“darkness seemed to breathe”) is character-bound and pays off in the healed-sky image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature (“learned to read dust like scripture”) is distinctive and sustained. Syntax modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped closing declarations, mirroring shift from memory to resolve. No dialogue, so voice tests default to narration; register stays within Eleanor’s plausible lexicon. One hairline slip—“something unfurl in her chest” approaches cliché—prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature leans architectural ("engineered...forgettable") and archival ("margins and signatures"). No dialogue, so voice is carried by interior cadence that stays controlled, almost reportorial, matching clandestine temperament. Occasional elevated diction ("auric lagoon," "conceptual repricing") slightly overshoots Mira’s civil-service perch but remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: syntax lengthens during melodic arcs, fragments at silences; filter verbs serve voice (“she felt the familiar pull”). No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned elision (“note by absence, breath by silence”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Psychic distance modulates—wide at grotto rim, micro inside throat—without head-hop. Tense stable; metaphor vehicles (virus, prism, shroud) stay consistent and physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Wren’s perceptual filter—“weight,” “shell,” “subtle imperfections” are sorter’s diction. Syntax lengthens in calm, fragments under hush (“Not a message. An invitation.”) mirroring altered time. No head-hopping; narrator knowledge never exceeds hers. Dialogue absent by design; voice sustains lyric authority without purple drift. Tiny register lifts (“crystallized sap,” “conceptual repricing”) are justified by her years of solitary study.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: gears “that no longer measured time,” fungi “impossible blue,” leaves that “never settled.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then fragments under physical strain (“She began to dig. Finger-touch leather.”). No head-hopping; admiral’s voice enters only via found text. Diction stays within her mechanical lexicon; the final ascension sheds numbers—“she didn’t count them”—a rhythmic release that mirrors theme.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice is lyrical but anchored in alchemical diction—“tincture,” “crucible,” “transcendent”—with syntax that mirrors heating/cooling rhythm (long reflective sentences, then short declarative beats). No dialogue, so no register drift. Occasional elevated phrasing (“captured tears,” “celestial scorpion”) borders on poetic overwrite but stays consistent with her factually-mystical vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly sewn to Maren’s perceptions; diction (“opaque as river fog,” “wheezed genuine delight”) is specific to her melancholy humor. No head-hopping. Rhythm swells with harp note, then fractures into shorter clauses under spirit voices—intentional modulation. Lyric elision (centuries summarized in two lines) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person deep POV maintains stable psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is character-specific: numeric pollen, voltage-tinged proprioception, actuary diction—“rounding error.” Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses when she kneels, longer reflective runs when tracing equations. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Compression and ellipses (“three hours ago…”) are taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Miriam’s technician diction—“multimeter,” “mainspring barrel,” “oilcloth.” Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices dust thickness, spiral heart of metal, weight distribution. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Syntax is clean; occasional lyric lift (“wind through paper”) is ghost-permitted and brief. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly anchored to Maren’s perceptual filter—ink-stained fingers, glass hum, frost dialect—without drifting into omniscient tourism. Syntax elongates in contemplative beats, then compresses during the lever pull: “She pulled the lever. The whisper exploded…” mirroring her pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the diction stays within a printer’s plausible lexicon (“composing stone,” “lead type”). The rhythmic drop into fragmentary awe at the end (“laughed. The sound was crystal chimes…”) is earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric-accumulative voice is consistent, with patterned diction (“baroque asteroid,” “burnished sorrow”) taught early and paid off in final poem. Syntax mirrors temporal glide—long, winding sentences calmed by fragmentary beats. Perceptual signature is specific: Maren sees “faces like polished amber,” counts “cold spaces.” No dialogue, so voice never contaminates. Register stays within her poetic-academic lexicon; no corporate drift. Rhythm modulates—short final poem acts as heartbeat stop—charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s tuner-brain: harmonic vocabulary, mechanical metaphors for emotion, no knowledge beyond the bench. Rhythm swells and thins with the music; short sentences under the “wilting” beat mimic skipped gears. No dialogue, so voice carries solely through syntax and sensory filter. Compression (“tinkersong wonder”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly lensed through Maren’s perceptual quirks—smell-first, map-skeptic, sternum-pull. Syntax leans toward liquid length in lagoon descriptions, then fragments under threshold pressure (“The compass needle began to spin.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One near-drift: “hinged awakenings” risks coined abstraction, yet the phrase is anchored to Vennard’s journal and paid off in the hinge of her own awakening, keeping diction earned.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Marina’s perceptual filter—wind “like a turbine’s hum” mirrors her sculptor ear for rhythm. Compression taught early (“patterns she hadn’t carved”) pays off at closure; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyrical close-third stays steady; no POV leakage. Perceptual signature—light rendered as copper, snow as silver stream—matches painter’s eye. Compression such as “dawning hush became her teacher” is taught by repetition of pre-sun vigils and pays off in mural consecration. Sentence rhythm rises and falls like breath, matching hush-to-bloom tempo; no syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lush yet disciplined metaphoric register—“clouds the color of old bruises,” “wound in the earth that remembered”—remains anchored to Celeste’s archivist precision. No head-hopping; Josefina’s granddaughter speaks in terse, desert-tested idiom that contrasts with Celeste’s cataloguing diction, marking status shift. Retrocognitive fragments compress time without confusing tense; patterned fragments taught early and paid off at final pebble circle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays consistently anchored to Mira’s perceptual filter—warmth of glass, selective attention to lantern sway. Syntax is controlled, slight rhythmic lift in the dawn sequence mirrors emotional rise; no head-hopping. Diction remains within an alchemist’s lexicon without forced academic register. Voice is distinct enough to avoid generic fantasy cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: archaic-linguistic precision (“Akkadian…Linear A…proto-language”) yet tactile—wax warmth, stylus drag. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long sentences for incantation, fragment at “Accidental prophecy.” No head-hopping; single POV stable. Filter verbs used sparingly and voiced (“she felt tears” justified by childhood memory). Diction stays within scribe’s arcane lexicon; no corporate register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Maren’s perceptual filter—she notices frost patterns, seed Latin, the ache of cold—never venturing beyond what her gloved hand can test. Syntax lengthens under starlight, then fractures into short pulses during the hum, mirroring molecular alignment. No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythmic burden and succeeds. Diction stays within her seed-saver lexicon; “vortex inheritance” is the lone abstract coinage, but it is taught by ritual context early enough to feel inherited, not invented.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter—she feels for frays, tastes thin air, hears micro-winds—without leaking omniscience. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic hush: “Pressure shifted without storms… light arrived unfiltered…” Metaphor is sparse but precise: the rope “resembled a living thing, scarred and strengthened.” No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the quiet diction never drifts into academic or corporate register. Rhythm breathes with the scene—short clauses build anticipation before the long, resonant pull.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s synesthetic perception—”honeyed, alive”—and controls psychic distance; syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses at dawn. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent cosmic loneliness. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; diction never drifts above her self-taught star-reader register.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual bias: she clocks “heat shimmer,” “translucent tears that vanish,” never external diagnosis. Syntax grows paratactic under pressure—“She opened the box… the ghost was already fading”—mirroring her stripped attentiveness. No head-hopping; diction stays within desert-isolate register. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“Maren felt the weight settle”), serving immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Vera notices temporal decay as weight, light sediment, radio frequencies of childhood kitchens. Syntax stays spare, scientific, matching a timekeeper’s precision. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight. Compression (“green light as shimmering green waves”) is taught early and paid off at capsule sealing. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence issue. One register wobble—“emotional archaeology” drifts academic—but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, poet-tinged diction (“cobalt lagoon,” “woven dawns”) filtered through Mira’s perceptual lens without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences post-storm tighten into clipped kite-repair motions. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is coherent—no mixed vehicles. Dialogue is sparse, natural, kid-authentic. Meets 9+ quick test; only hairline restraint from 9.0 is one “burnished hush” that flirts with preciousness, but cadence earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—selective botanical noticing, copper gleam as syntax. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during climbing beats, breathes during diary entries, mirroring stamina drain. No dialogue present; narrative voice carries subtext through imagistic indirection. Diction stays within rustic-scientific lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mira with a perceptual signature—“she called it an artificial pilgrimage”—and modulates into lyrical compression at the height: “luminous now, lit from within.” No head-hopping; syntax mirrors her analytical bent then softens into reverence without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, diction aligned to Erasmus’s scholarly bereavement: “Sumerian best,” “Linear B that he had reconstructed.” Rhythm ebbs and flows like tidal sentences, mirroring surf-patterned ritual. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Perceptual signature is consistent—bird calls read as genuine syntax, not magical trope. Experimental compression (lyric loops) taught early, paid off in glowing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited clings to Marta’s bloodhound perceptual grammar: verbs of scent, color-as-odor, joints that “protest.” Rhythm mirrors stamina—long sentences for trudge, staccato for dig. No dialogue from Marta keeps voice inside sinew and sniff; Ven’s brief line is utilitarian, avoiding voice clash. Compression like “the dead were everywhere, and the living had stopped counting” teaches the pattern of lyrical ellipsis that closure reprises.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s slowed perceptions; no head-hopping. Syntax elongates subtly—“each beat a sustained drumroll”—mirroring temporal stretch without overwriting. Diction stays within her scientist-poet lexicon: “stellar movements visible only to someone blessed and cursed.” No dialogue, so voice carries all; the prose breathes at climax when single-sentence paragraphs mimic the slow pulse of her heart. A hairline slip into lyric repetition (“silence echoed around her”) but it is pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Corwin’s perceptual filter: violet sky “pressing like a living thing,” pawn warm despite frost. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical cadence for sky, clipped clauses during puzzle—mirroring tension. Diction within lexicon except “sacredly playful reverence,” a coined phrase that reads self-conscious. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on metaphor and syntax; succeeds but one register drift keeps it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight inside Vera’s perceptual filter; no head-hops. Syntax lengthens and compresses with her walking rhythm, mirroring camp-metric cadence. Diction—“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless”—remains within lexicon of a multilingual survivor who has rehearsed official euphemisms. Free indirect (“She called it purgatory”) fuses narrator and character judgment cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Vera’s perceptual signature: silver lungs, dust she “breathes,” symbols that “move like insects beneath glass.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses during inscription beats, mirroring the accretive process. No head-hopping; the reflective passages are anchored to present tactile cues. Diction stays within the fabulist register without drifting into pseudo-epic bombast.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited sticks to Marcus’s sensory sieve: flour clouds, maze ridges felt by eye, metallic taste of remorse. Syntax lengthens during decoding, shortens at release, mirroring breath. No POV leakage; village voices remain frozen externals. Distinct perceptual signature—thread twist direction as data—keeps voice individuality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Sera; perceptual signature filters through artistic metaphors (“paint-stained fingers,” “light through glass”). Rhythm modulates from ritual cadence to cascading anaphora (“She stole bread…”) under peak pressure. No head-hopping; Elders’ voices remain external, indistinct—intentionally dissolved. Diction stays within Sera’s lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: alchemical diction (caustic, transmutation, grimoires) braided with maritime corrosion lexicon (pockmarked, pontoons, submersion). Syntax mirrors breathless compression under stress—“Time compressed. She saw herself as a child...” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, staccato for lurch. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she wondered if today...”) and stay consistent. Tense and psychic distance stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays close to Edwin’s perceptual filter: “improbably clear,” “living punctuation,” “intimately aloof” are his idiom. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during painting frenzy, then relaxes into lyrical cadence for closure. No head-hopping; distance stable. Free indirect slips (“temporary eternity—that was what his art teacher had called…”) are character-bound and motivate the canvas choice. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “stone breathe,” “ocean eyes,” syntax breathes with her fatigue. No head-hop; distance tightens at hand-off moment. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon yet achieves lyric compression. Voice modulation under stress is visible in the fragment “Come, the gesture said.”

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s salt-cracked perception: diction of “patina green-black,” “shattered lenses,” “raw solace” feels hers, not authorial. Rhythmic compression under fatigue—sentence fragments mirror her clipped stamina. No head-hop; unreliability surfaces only when she misrecognizes the caller until the final beat, a payoff seeded by earlier doublings (echoed coordinates, mirrored starlight). Filter verbs appear only when they voice her professionalism (“she could plot exact locations”). Dialogue-free design is apt for solitary watch; voice remains singular.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays inside Maren’s scientific perceptual filter: spores, pH, mycelial language. Syntax tightens under pressure—“she wept” stands alone as two-word paragraph, mirroring the stripped new freedom. No filter-verb stacks; “seemed to hold something patient” keeps uncertainty in POV. Voice never slips into editorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is razor-specific: “language of silences,” “salt of lives he had never lived”—diction that only a lifelong eavesdropper on emptiness would use. Rhythm modulates: long clause-stack sentences for contemplative beats, then clipped fragments (“The memory fractured”) under intrusion. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy stays intact. Compression (“borrowed memories, he called them”) teaches the lyric pattern early; payoff in final handwritten sentence is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is precise, antiquarian-tinged, rhythmically controlled—“silence pressing against her like water,” “counterpoint to her heartbeat.” POV distance stays tight third; perceptual signature in map jargon and tactile paper details. No head-hop; free indirect slips cleanly into peak beat. Compression taught early (“empirically intuitive sense”) and remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to queen; perceptual signature favors tactile detail (“her body remembering movements…before the crown weighted her skull”). Syntax lengthens under fatigue, shortens after revelation: controlled rhythm. Diction royal yet bodily (“luminous ichor,” “weighted her skull”) maintains class without purple drift. Filter verbs minimal; no POV slippage. Dialogue sparse but subtext-laden (“You already knew”), distinct from narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature: logarithmic spirals, half-lives, starlight wavelengths. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under threat—rhythmic control evident. No head-hop; Theo’s interior accessed only via readable externals. Diction stays within alchemist lexicon; “ember nexus,” “pocket-sun” feel native, not grafted. Voice remains distinct even in peak emotional flare.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature sharp—“jade of her exhaustion,” “feral nostalgia” belong to Vera’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences for memory, clipped fragments under jealousy. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Metaphors integrated to POV: scroll as net, chaos as narrative. Meets 9+ quick test for distinct signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s anosmic perception, filtering world through touch and sound; no head-hop. Diction—“petroleum of old lubricants,” “copper oxidation”—mirrors clock-repair precision. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for foggy patience, staccato for screw’s release. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual (“They said you restore things” = restore me), distinct from Elena’s tactile internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyrical close-distance stays inside Mira’s perceptual filter: selective crow-count, scent of char, geometry of scar. Syntax lengthens during calms, fragments under frost flare—rhythmic modulation matches breath control. No dialogue to judge; narrator diction within apprentice lexicon. Filter verbs (“she saw”) appear only when perception itself is the stakes. Voice is consistent, textured, and distinct to her storm-scarred worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no head-hop. Voice is metaphor-steeped yet precise: “voice like wind through hollow reeds,” “crystal facets catching what little light remained.” Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, shortens under generator hum, mirroring tension. Ghost’s diction (“My mother’s. I thought it was lost”) is distinct, airy, yet goal-driven—she wants the bottle back, then the symphony played.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a rapt, incantatory cadence; diction stays within cosmic-philosophic register without jarring shifts. Perceptual signature is consistent—witness notices geologic memory, etymologies, spiral geometry—filtering world through abstract curiosity. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal texture is controlled via patterned metaphor and hyphenated coinages (“wanderingly exact”) that teach the reader early. Compression and elision are purposeful, payoff legible at closure; rhythm breathes with paragraph varietals that mimic spiral turns.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Einar’s perceptual filter: he “squints harder,” hears blood in veins, notices “too sharp” stars. Diction is precise and slightly archaic (“calloused fingers,” “brass horn”) matching the isolated, pre-digital station. Rhythm compresses during the countdown—short, paratactic clauses mimic pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on interiority and description; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Prose texture is lyric but always in service of the accumulative pattern, culminating in the crystalline razor image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person floats close to Maya’s skin; perceptual signature is color-wavelength synesthesia fused with network-architect spatial sense. Rhythm breathes—long lyrical sentences for cavern glow, clipped fragments when she presses the laser. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing) is internally licensed by her tech background.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Margot; no head-hop. The prose’s rhythmic control—“the beautiful impossibility of being human”—matches her mathematically inflected melancholy without leaving her lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The only micro-drift is the phrase “theoretically rebellious,” which sounds like outside copy rather than her self-description, but it occurs once and early. Cadence modulates from long rain-soaked sentences to the staccato of found coordinates, mirroring her pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera; perceptual signature leans auditory (hum of lamps, teeth-like clicks) and tactile (worn-smooth glass edge). Syntax flexes with pressure—short sentence bursts during advice (“Start there.”), then languid cadence for resonant close. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue carries subtext: caller’s ellipsis before “My son’s old number” reveals more than exposition could.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Marguerite’s archivist perception—attention to ink, faded ink, paper-settling sound. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, never drifts into committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s logistical gaze; diction like “logistician,” “relief camps,” “airlifted” remains inside her lexicon. Rhythm accelerates at the hand-off, then exhales into lyrical final paragraph. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Okonkwo’s “quite hostile without regular negotiation” is scientist-gardener hybrid; Maya’s quip about the vineyard is jocular armor. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop. Voice could edge higher with more idiosyncratic syntax under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays inside her perceptual logic—ultrasonic textures, ring pulls, bark grammar—without POV slippage. Syntax lengthens in calmer passages, fragments under sensorial rush, mirroring heartbeat of discovery. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is singular: precise scientific diction braided with lyrical compression (“time folded like wet paper”). Psychic distance modulates—tight for palm-equations, mid for cosmic static—without head-hop. The dry-pen micro-movement is rendered in tactile, rhythmic shards that match anomaly shudders. No register drift, no filter-verb bloat; the final cadence lands with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyracal third-person hovers at Mira’s perceptual frequency—“sheet of liquid silver,” “music waiting to be born”—syntax mirrors her tidal patience. Sign-language passages adopt telegraphic brevity, rhythmically distinct from surrounding prose, teaching the reader the pattern. No head-hop; Elena’s interior is surfaced only through observed gesture and dialogue, staying within Mira’s deaf POV. Diction stays inside Mira’s plausible lexicon while achieving poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is volcanic—compressed, hot, exact: “love so fierce it threatened destruction, so quiet it barely disturbed the air.” Perceptual signature is analytic yet sensorily acute (“cataloging every temperature shift”). Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary breathlessness during descent, then widens into cathedral hush at the portrait. No dialogue to contaminate; internal diction stays within a twenty-four-year-old autodidact’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays tightly pinned to Mira’s sensory cascade; no head-hop. Percussive syntax (“drumming on everything within reach”) mirrors musical cognition. Lexicon stays within credible scientist-patient range—quantum fibers, molecular lattice—without jargon dump. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered as physical resonance (“she heard Elias in its shimmer”). Voice modulation under stress: clauses shorten as beat intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Celia’s auditory perceptions; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, whisper-calibrated; diction never exceeds dock-worker lexicon. Rhythm tightens with shorter beats during the final approach, mirroring her spontaneous yet rehearsed footfall pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person intimate sustains a hushed, tidal rhythm; syntax lengthens then contracts like canal breath. Dental-mirror perceptual signature recurs—“angles where darkness gathered thickest”—without drifting into clinical detachment. Metaphors stay within her vocational lexicon: nautilus of light, scattered diamonds. Filter verbs almost absent; immediacy intact. No dialogue, so voice evaluation defaults to narrative texture, which is singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Eleanor’s perceptual signature—magnetic fields, starlight on iron, the hush where prophecy meets past—without head-hopping. Syntax flexes with emotional temperature: long, clause-heavy sentences during reflection, then clipped prepositional phrases (“Down she went”) when she descends into action. Diction stays inside her plausible lexicon; no corporate or academic register intrudes. The only voiced line is the town’s collective silent thought, rendered as italicized subtext, a clean indirection that preserves POV distance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Performer’s idiom is sustained—measured theatrical cadence, script-like stage directions (“our heroine returns inside”)—without syntactic monotony. Perceptual signature filters every object through dramaturgy (shadows = broken clock hands; wood curls = unshed tears). No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Filter verbs (“she wondered”) are few and motivated by narrator persona.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains psychic distance tight to Mora’s perceptual lens: “like a ghost remembering its bones,” “read its surface the way others read manuscripts.” Syntax grows cadenced, almost chant-like under quartz hum, mirroring poetry’s rhythm. No head-hopping; diction stays within her aesthetic vocabulary (“lantern-moth hush,” “cloud-shadow poet”). Compression taught early (“cobalt atrium stood…”) and paid off in glowing final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays close to Mira’s synesthetic attention; perceptual signature strong—she “feels” color as heat before she sees it. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for courtyard catalog, staccato for visual explosion. Dialogue minimal but distinct; Theo’s register is cool oracular, hers pragmatic. No filter-verb stacks or head-hop. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” diction creeps into narrative once, but it’s brief and doesn’t contaminate voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s synesthetic ear; perceptual signature is consistent (“she could almost taste” whale frequencies). No dialogue, so voice distinction test waived. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, breathless sentences during the whale station, clipped fragments at the empty silence. No register drift; carbide-lens terminology stays within miner-grandmother lexicon. Rhythm under bell-ringing finale mimics tolling cadence—intentional and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bias: stars as clocks, paper as pulse, stencil as map. Syntax grows leaner under stress—“She picked up her tools, not to escape grief but to carry it forward”—mirroring her shift from numbness to action. No dialogue, so voice purity is judged on narrative texture alone; register remains consistent, never drifts into editorial. The final line’s sibilants (“secret promise that withering”) echo crane-fold whispers, a rhythmic callback.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filter: numbers, distances, absorption values—her world is metrics. Syntax lengthens when she confides, mimicking academic candor, then tightens back to observational fragments. No filter-verb stacks; rain “drumming like impatient fingers” is the single figurative reach, earned by her metaphor-starved mindset. Marcus’s dialogue is clipped finance-speak collapsing into monosyllabic need.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet controlled: “colors that no longer existed in the modern world” is perception-specific to a historian of lost spectra. Rhythm climbs from languid twilight cadence to staccato ritual verbs (“began by avoiding patterns, speaking words in random sequences”). No head-hop; interior access stays strictly Mira-bound. Occasional elevated register (“anguished joy”) is justified by Netharan mythic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“petals of translucent walls,” “hope-lattices”—is lyrical yet disciplined, avoiding purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through a reptile-centric eye: starlight “pools,” mist “curls,” color “shifts.” Syntax lengthens in calmer reflection, fractures into clipped participles during sanding—rhythm mirrors breath. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on diction control; no register drift into jargon. Metaphorical vehicles (starlight as liquid, tail as lighthouse) stay consistent with Vera’s vocation and are paid off in the charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual signature: synesthetic plant whispers, circular time in coffee stains.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filter; diction (“nitrate dreams,” “incubated hope”) is voice-specific without purple drift. Syntax breathes with the psychometry surge—long, clause-heavy sentences under pressure, then quiet declarative exits. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext alone. Rhythm control is secure enough for 9-band but one clause-string approaches 40 words near climax, slightly diluting punch.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception (“colors she could almost taste”). Rhythm swells with aurora, then breathes in the quiet rust close; no head-hop or register drift. One clause of therapy-speak (“she had not experienced since childhood. Peace.”) is a micro-slip.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person hovers close to Mira’s sinew: "boots sinking," "chest ache," perceptual filter tuned to quantum lullabies. Diction stays within her colloquial range—no academic leakage—even when folding wave functions. Rhythm modulates: long sand-dune sentences breathe, then shorten at the summit encounter. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; the child’s speech is brief, distinct, and child-simple ("I fell through").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s sensorium; perceptual signature is acoustic-philosophical—“hum of insight,” “minor keys,” “gossip in frequencies.” Syntax flexes from pastoral calm to clockwork diction without register drift.

Consistent interior idiom anchors lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric-accumulative voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: “lanterns burning with the soft persistence of stars that refuse to fade” is both sight and metaphor filtered through Mira’s regret. Rhythm modulates from lullaby cadence to short, breath-catching fragments at each unlived reveal. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Mira. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but voice-bearing—eldest guide’s shoreline-smoothed kindness contrasts with Mira’s swallowed silence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays tight to Mira’s ancient, courtly idiom—“regally unpretentious,” “stars learned their current positions”—without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: Marina’s world is felt through fingertip percussion—wood, paper, glass—creating a phonograph of grief. Compression taught early: “periodically eternal” and “creature that had forgotten how to swim” prime the reader for lyric density that never drops clarity. No head-hopping; temporal slips (“had documented”) are motivated by archival drive. Final cadence—“whatever reckoning it would bring”—modulates to propulsive anticipation without leaving the established rhythmic palette.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lensed on Maya; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—celestial metaphors, barefoot sensitivity, vintage-tool nostalgia—creating a distinct stargazer idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical, compressed diction mirrors steam—“the plants fell silent, listening”—with aging-singer rasp; no head-hop; patterned elision (kite symbols→song) taught early and paid off at closure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is horticultural—plants “clinging,” roots “threading,” orchids as stress-barometers.

Filter verbs (“she felt”) are justified by somatic tracking; diction stays within gardener-therapist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Eleanor’s perceptual quirks: noticing dust motes as “passengers on a sinking vessel,” feeling walls “closer now than when she’d entered.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short questions that mime her broken sight. No head-hopping; psychic distance choreographed—intimate for finger-thread, middle-distance for lantern memory. Rhetorical questions read as self-conversation, not reader nudge; diction stays within her artistic lexicon (“transparency over opacity”). Voice modulation matches pressure: clauses shorten when walls contract.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lean, wind-scoured, neurologically exact: “seconds became hours and she could see every mote of dust suspended in amber light.” Perceptual signature—red-eyed albino noticing light gradations, mechanical drone as counter-rhythm—never slips. Syntax tightens under pressure: single-word sentences (“Needle descended”) mimic clock-tick. No head-hop; lyrical elision (“the world remembered how to breathe again”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“cataloging the dead-but-dreaming,” numeric chamber labels—archivist-biased. Syntax breathes: long cold opening, then staccato “One keystroke… One more.” Dialogue sparse, indirection adequate: “Whatever you think you understand—” conveys threat without exposition. No head-hopping; Vance’s interior accessed only through external cues. Voice control strong but not quite virtuosic enough for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)

Diction stays within a coastal worker’s lexicon until “conceptual” finale, justified by cosmic re-pricing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Margaret; perceptual signature is mathematical, almost proof-based (“proof by contradiction—she remembered that much”). Syntax glides from long atmospheric sentences to staccato realisations (“Tomorrow.”). No head-hop; focalization disciplined. Prose rhythm mirrors emotional intake: slow circling of notebooks, then abrupt laughter that breaks the cadence. Diction stays within her educated but non-astronomer lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and particular: time curls like smoke remembering flame, meteor hush ripples the fold, dawn tastes of forgiveness—Vera’s synesthetic ear shapes every line.

Free-indirect texture stays clean; “impossible, but Vera had stopped believing in impossible…” keeps psychic distance tight yet lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tight keeps close psychic distance to Mira; perceptual signature is color-acoustic: “colors that no longer existed,” “spirals nesting within spirals.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for mandala building, staccato for whisper interjections.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric distance stable; perceptual signature filters every detail through retrocognitive bias (“the world dissolved”). Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during vision dumps, longer cadence for carving. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within Kira’s plausible lexicon; “tessera,” “retrocognitive,” “aberrant mercy” are concept-terms she would own. One near-filter stack: “she felt his pride, his exhaustion, his quiet hope” could compress, but rhythm serves the beat and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The synesthetic ghost-voice paints applause as crimson swells, despair as indigo pools—perceptual signature that never slips into generic color symbolism. Rhythm modulates: long breath-sentence of twilight settling, then staccato shard-cuts of historical dialogue. No dialogue from the living woman, a deliberate absence that turns the coin’s glint into her only spoken line. Register remains consistent: 18th-century diction in echoes stays lightly antique without pastiche.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at Vera’s thermal register: diction of gradient, pulse, strata, bioluminescence stays inside her professional idiom. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for descent, shorter fragments at luminous encounter—mirrors tension without drumbeat monotony. No filter-verb clusters; perception remains embodied. Just shy of 9: syntax could push further at climax to mimic sensor blur.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside coachman’s perceptions; perceptual signature is auditory/tactile—“fog speaks,” gutters “tick,” rope creaks.

No head-hop; girl’s interior accessed only via observable hollow eyes. Dialogue minimal but carries subtext: “I listen. I feel.” Voice cohesion survives gift moment without sentimental uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person close maintains potter’s perceptual signature: angles of light read as wheel-thrower would notice, smoke ribbons flatten like pressed glass sheets.

Grandfather’s quoted line is the only external voice and is framed as remembered speech, not narrative intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited hugs Mira’s perceptual bias: mist currents “arrive,” stones “hum,” chirp hits her chest. Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under shock (“Not leviathans… something new”). No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Register stays lyrical yet internally consistent; only a single elevated clause—“atomically reflective”—leans toward textbook, quickly absorbed by the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Detached, scientific diction (“concentric circles,” “gravity lens”) stays inside an astrophysicist’s lexicon; syntax grows clipped under EM pressure (“Good.”). Perceptual signature is strongly particular—she notices declination lines in candlelight, feels subsonics “in the liquid of her eyes.” No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue (Morrison shout) is brief, goal-driven, subtext of institutional panic.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)

Rhythm accelerates during the sketch, then settles into the final quiet cadence as mist lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual filter—“spongey dread,” “nervous confidence”—with no head-hopping.

Final image (“winds…promise of their own undoing”) is rhythmically controlled, recharging earlier motif without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays tight to Margaret’s perceptual signature: sound-first metaphors, musician’s catalog of faces, photographer’s eye for silver halide.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person keeps perceptual distance befitting Elias's guarded "polished calm"; selective attention favors salvageable artifacts and currency iconography, consistent with entrepreneur hobbyist.

One minor filter-stack (“she recognized the expression immediately”) but voice remains distinct and consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly interior to Mira; perceptual signature is botanical and somatic—“roots she had cultivated herself,” “hummed against her skin like a tuning fork.” Rhythm modulates: lyrical open, compressed urgency during maze growth, stateliness at the Charged Poise. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Metaphor chain (bruise sky, tuning fork, overlapping shadows) is purposeful and pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“mineral memory,” “wounded bird”) is hers, not tour-guide. Rhythm accelerates during the bargain, then breathes in the final ascent. No head-hopping; Gardener’s voice is external and distinct. Compression (“fiercely gentle, soft as moss, warm as decay”) is patterned and paid off in his touch at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter—roadie lexicon, appraisal jargon, quarry dust on skin; rhythmic compression under stress (“Facts were armor. Facts didn’t ask…”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final stripped sentence, no POV drift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person hovers just above the protagonist, sustained by fog, gauze, and cipher imagery; diction stays within her perceptual lexicon (“captured fog,” “champagne bubbles held beneath a cork”). Rhythm modulates: long vowel runs for awe, fragmentary clauses when she touches the frozen-tears spine. No head-hopping; focalization remains pinned to the Dreamer. The single POV and poetic compression meet the 9- gate; only the slightly expositional “now she understood” keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)

Register stable; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, never wider than her perceptual field: temperature gradients, metal grain, formula syllables.

The sustained musical note momentarily compresses diction (“mirrors sing… shattered frost”) without breaking POV coherence, fulfilling 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Narrative voice is lyric-accumulative, present-tense stable, with controlled psychic distance.

No head-hop; grandmother’s voice arrives only via letter and painting, never omniscient intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mei Lin; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture (gold leaf, tape spools) over abstract concepts. Free indirect style is clean: “She should have told you…” slips into mother’s idiom without head-hop. Diction remains within Mei Lin’s artisanal lexicon—“zinc-etched,” “gilded-leaf”—never drifts into academic register. Rhythm mirrors tension: short clauses during descent, longer lyrical sweep in the archive; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings to Maren’s synesthetic sensorium; diction stays inside her plausible lexicon (“taste of bronze,” “sandpaper” dissonance). Rhythm mirrors altitude: long inhalant clauses ascend the bluff, then shorten into percussive fragments as the bell rings.

Distinctive rhythmic signature sustains without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves a hushed, incantatory rhythm that mirrors content; syntactic parallelism (“She summoned… She called… She placed…”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final quiet. Perceptual signature is acute: Mira hears “water that moved without sound” and sees “silver-lit branches” exactly as a silence-worker would. No head-hop, no register drift. Dialogue absent by design—no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: elevators sing, banisters deserve apologies, window glass holds memories—idiosyncratic, consistent.

Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. No dialogue on page, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; “resonance structures” is the only tech phrase, already diegetic. Distinct texture sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person tight stays inside Veren’s perceptual filter: “ink the color of midnight,” “calibrated treason” are scribe-thoughts.

Free indirect style cleanly fuses with lyrical elevation without breaking lexicon ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)

    Lyric third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “ice held memory,” “voices scattered across dreams.” Syntax lengthens in calm beats, fragments under trance compression, always purposeful. Zero dialogue removes voice-distinction risk; interior diction stays consistent and glacier-cold. Patterned elision (dream snapshots shuffled) is taught by line 5 and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; qualifies for 9+ if one more rhythmic surge had been timed to the final step onto snow.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited remains fixed inside Mirelle’s perceptual filter; diction—“net-mender philosopher,” “moon paths,” “mathematics hidden in their knots”—is idiosyncratic yet believable.

No dialogue, so voice carries solely through textured narration that sounds like her inner whistle—quiet, precise, persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited remains tight to Maya’s investigator diction: “counting mutations,” “ink consistencies,” “paper grain.” Rhythm compresses under storm pressure—short clauses mimic respirator cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature—sound as frequency data, color as navigational code. Rhythm accelerates with clause fragmentation under molecular stress: “fleshly and ethereal simultaneously.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter: magnifying spectacles become “magnifying spectacles pushed up on her forehead,” not “Ruth’s glasses,” because he notices tools before faces. Syntax lengthens under guilt—“I was young, frightened, and I convinced myself…”—then fractures into short clauses when he accepts imperfection. No head-hop; Ruth’s interior is accessed only through her observable pause. Voice modulation under pressure is evident when the storm-light sentence suddenly blooms into painterly cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a consistent, gear-tinged diction: “mechanical heartbeat,” “mathematical hunger.” Syntax stays short, ratchety, mirroring cog-clicks; pressure scenes compress. No head-hop; POV modesty maintained—she wonders, doesn’t declare metaphysics. Boiler’s diction is distinct steam-snort. Final image (“it was listening now”) lands with rhythmic snap. One tiny filter stack in “she could transliterate” but beat is low-pressure; no 9+ bar broken.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Helena’s cataloguer diction, compressed sentences under vault pressure (“hunted for meaning,” “pounding against her ribs”) keep rhythm distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)

Diction—“lexicographic,” “etymology,” “calcified” —remains within scholar’s lexicon; rhythm lengthens during reflection, shortens during acoustic tests. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks. Crystal personification (“testified,” “shivered”) is motivated by her enchanted-scientist stance. Voice distinctiveness is moderate; a hair more syntactic quirk could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is saturated with hush, salt, and videotape static—“the particular silence of moments recorded but never played back.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with Marcus’s fugue states, teaching the reader the rhythm of memory loss.

    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira with clean psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction is lightly elevated—“borrowed starlight,” “language of power”—but remains within a scholar-apprentice lexicon. Rhythm varies from long, winding sentences that mimic spiral stairs to short, chime-like automaton speech. No dialogue between humans, so voice distinctness is shown through Mira’s quiet precision against the brass figure’s cryptic aphorisms. Perceptual signature is present: she notices runes, mechanisms, and star-gaps rather than landscape prettiness.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays inside Maren’s perceptual grid: minerals “glisten,” glass “catches,” mist “breathes”—all jeweler vocabulary. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for descent into memory, staccato for placing fragments. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Filter verbs (“seemed to answer”) are voice-motivated, showing her habit of anthropomorphizing tools and place.

Distinctive rhythmic signature in recurring “swimming against the current” without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—mechanics jargon, color-return synesthesia, fear of her own voice. Rhythm swells with clause-length cadence that mirrors spinning phonograph gears, then fractures at climax (“Her voice cracked”). No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under pressure. Register never exceeds her plausible lexicon. Meets 9- gate on texture but lacks the final hairline risk to punch 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close sustains alchemist’s perceptual signature—attention to fracture lines, oxidation, latent luminescence. Syntax slows with ritual, contracts with cold: “Each placement took minutes, sometimes longer.” No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythm; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“she could feel it”) are rare and voice-motivated, appearing only at closure to mark the map’s activation. Diction stays within artisan lexicon—vial, etch, starlight—never drifts into pseudo-poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, patient, syntactically lathed like the gears Elena files—"the marble cavern breathed with the patience of centuries" sets the cadence and the metaphoric register holds. Perceptual signature is consistent: locksmith first, mystic second—she hears "tumblers fall" where another might hear thunder. Compression is taught early ("autumn first stumbled and fell wounded") and paid off in the final silence that "refused to commit," completing the seasonal motif. No dialogue means no register drift; interior diction stays within the plausible lexicon of a craftsperson who thinks in angles and tensions.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature is Elara’s auditory bias—“shingled hush,” “mineral sweat,” threads that “hum.” Syntax grows shorter under peak pressure—“She whispered it once, testing the shape of it in her mouth”—mirroring crystallization. No dialogue to distort voice. Diction stays within mythic register without drifting into academic or therapy idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual filter—selective attention to warehouse decay, fingertip feel of corrosion, internal contradiction between filial love and forensic instinct. Syntax stays restrained, mirroring her methodical habits, then compresses into short clauses as the chain tightens: “Hand over hand, she began to salvage…” No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation centers on narrative texture, which remains internally consistent and idiomatically English without register drift. Father’s letter adopts a slightly formal antiquity that contrasts yet fits a dying smuggler’s written confession, so brief convergence is earned. Distinctive perceptual signature is sustained: professionalized attention to hollow spaces in narrative, not inherited sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s haptic attention; diction is restrained, marine, and winter-cold, with rhythmic alternation between short observations and longer sinuous sentences that mimic rope spirals.

    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual bias: heat, glass, dental hum. Syntax lengthens under kelp peace, shortens when “radio sat silent.” No dialogue, so voice distinctness assessed via interior diction—“volcanic glass pooled beneath the dunes like frozen midnight”—which is character-specific, not tour-guide. Filter verbs are sparse; when used (“she realized”) they serve cadence, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is light but consistent (“brushstrokes frozen on gray canvas”). No dialogue to test. Prose rhythm modulates with scene temperature—lyric frost vs. rushing release—achieving modest but effective voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax lengthens and shortens with her breath—long clauses climbing, staccato counts descending. No dialogue, so voice contamination impossible. Diction remains inside her lexicon—“escapement,” “weights,” “loupe”—precise but not showy. The one risk—lyric abstract noun phrases like “slow arithmetic of the soul”—is earned by prior concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)

Voice never leaks into grandmother’s or stars’ perspective; focalization is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)

No dialogue, so no convergence risk; voice stays idiosyncratic and unpunctuated by editorial intrusion.

    Third-person limited clings to Margaret’s sensory filter: “velvet library held autumn like a secret” is a perception only she could craft. Diction tilts toward musical and botanical precision, reflecting her profession and heritage. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during the first pluck, then relaxes—an acoustic heartbeat. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Darius avoids harder subject → “Teach me”). Voice remains singular, textured, controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined: rusted ribcage, bleeding orange, synaptic bloom—metaphors cohere within chef’s synesthetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for moonlit growth, clipped harvest beats for dawn exit. No head-hopping; single POV holds.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person omniscient edges toward Veris's telepathic focalization without head-hopping; distance is stable. Syntax elongates to mimic watery slow-motion ("stone grinding against stone after millennia of stillness") then compresses under Mira's adrenaline. Diction stays within a diver's lexicon—regulator, ampoule, phosphorescent—without jargon spill. Perceptual signature is Veris's tactile memory of warmth versus Mira's copper-salt grief.

Syntax mirrors his mind—“spiraled wrong,” “wrongness felt like home”—and compresses under peak stress into fragmented percussive clauses as the beam ignites. No dialogue, hence no voice drift. Free indirect (“He understood then…”) is clean and character-bound. Near 9.0 but a few filter verbs (“he could only describe”) dull the final thrust.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Vera’s scholarly perceptual signature—parchment chemistry, idioms masked in archaic script. Syntax modulates: long cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for action (“She photographed every detail”). No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays inside Marina’s perceptual filter—every noticed barnacle routes through her grieving taxonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)

Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are spare and organic (“stillness settle around her like sediment”). Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during discovery, mirroring emotional contour. Distinctiveness is high; slight deduction for occasional elevated diction (“dappled resolve”) that edges toward the poetic-generic.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mei’s artisan perception; diction of polish, refraction, and paper grain feels specific. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences calm, then shorten at the capture. No head-hopping or register drift; “luminous torment” is the single allowed poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person psychic distance stays tight to Yara’s sensory filter: “tasting copper and ash,” “watching her breath fog.” Diction is controlled—no academic jargon beyond “perturbation theory,” which she literally uses. Rhythm accelerates into short beats during console beeps, then exhales into longer lyric sentences on clouds; the modulation mirrors her pulse. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; internal voice remains coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Detached, atmospheric third-person stays consistent and achieves a lyrical-cognitive texture suited to code-breaking. Sentence rhythm modulates—long reflective cadences contract to staccato drone commands under pressure. Diction stays within Mira’s tech-cartographer lexicon; no register drift. “Perpetually surprised expression she now wore” is the one filter-heavy line; otherwise perception is concrete and body-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited remains snug inside Maren’s perceptual filter: she reads tide-smoothed fingers as “desperate precision,” not artisanal praise. Syntax lengthens and fragments under shame—comma splices echo breath-catching. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom alone, and it does: “sieved hush” coined once, then left to resonate. Register never drifts into academic; diction stays within a forger who notices patina, grain, ink ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira; no head-hop. Diction—“furrowed hush,” “synchronize through moon phases”—is controlled and POV-apt. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, carries subtext (“I expected you would send someone else”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for reflection, clipped countdown for swap. No filter-verb clusters; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s perceptual filter: selective attention to brass weight, pole silhouettes, cormorant’s silver fish. Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long sentences in calmer fog, shorter fragments at pole sightings. Distinct maritime idiom (“swells,” “sentinels,” “bluffs”) without caricature. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior diction; no register drift. The “merrily melancholic” chord is voiced through contradiction in imagery rather than explanatory label.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close stays locked to Marcus; perception skewed by surgical haze and con-artist pattern-hunting instinct, e.g., “first letters that spelled coordinates.” Syntax mirrors his sifting mindset—clausal, slightly suspicious, culminating in abrupt short sentence “The date stopped him cold.” Elena’s dialogue carries jaded weariness in monosyllabic blow-outs: “I know.” Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“phantom limb”) stay in Marcus’s medical lexicon. No head-hopping; voice control holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: “luminescent fruit,” “feathers pressing from beneath flesh,” syntax mirroring bodily pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction reaches for cosmic register (“universe held her in its palm”) but remains anchored in her beast-whisperer sensorium. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses during metamorphosis, then softens into the final shared quiet, demonstrating control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited remains pinned to Morrigan’s perceptual signature: “lungs burning,” “jasmine and ozone and something older,” syntax lengthens then fragments as she weeps. No dialogue, so voice purity is judged on narrative texture: ink-in-veins metaphor recurs without churn, rhythm modulates from climbing cadence to hush of firefly dark. Free indirect style is clean: “She understood now…” stays within her lexicon. Compression (“three years of love restored”) is strategic, placed after sensory flood to maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric-scientific: “cathedral of salvaged memories” marries spiritual and mechanical registers in one breath. Perceptual signature is Mei Lin’s gravitational bias—she notices mass, drift, salt weight—consistent throughout. No dialogue, so naturalism test is waived. Free indirect slides cleanly into internal monologue without filter-verb clutter. Prose rhythm mirrors breath: long sentence for stitch meditation, fragment for “I am still angry,” mirroring tension release.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Miriam’s perceptual signature: astronomical patience, fiscal metaphors (“wealth felt like walls”), synesthetic craving for texture. Syntax lengthens and contracts with planetary or wing motion; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Register never drifts into self-help; even “texture of transformation” is earned through decades of tactile obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices keys, angles, loose stones, unrecognized footsteps—never the Duke’s interior. Diction is controlled, slightly elevated but consistent with a vigilant, self-schooled sentinel (“lens through which she saw the world”). Rhythm grows clipped during ascent—“She climbed the tower stairs... warm against her thigh”—then relaxes into the final luminous sentence, mirroring her release of tension. No head-hopping; no filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles (glass as gold, sparks as friction) stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close sustains eel-herder perceptual signature: nautilus proportions, meteorite grit, algae glow. Syntax grows clipped under visionary pressure (“The vision struck immediately, as it always did”). No dialogue, so voice purity judged via lyrical, tide-breath cadence that accelerates at climax. Elision taught early—“she had learned to look away”—and paid off when she chooses to look.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited sustained; perceptual signature filters cosmos through photographic lexicon (“distant fires,” “electric wonder”). Syntax lengthens during reflection, contracts at choice beats (“She pressed”). No head-hop; psychic distance controlled. Idiom stays within Elena’s lyric-intellectual range; diction never drifts into textbook abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is philosophical but particular—she notices cipher-angles, gear-whir, ethics in motion. Diction modulates from calm observation to compressed parry syntax. Dialogue indirection works (“curious that it remains unfinished”). One register hitch: “dignified chaos of political philosophy” is abstract where a visceral image would serve.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual signature—“rusted things are invisible to those seeking power”—a bias that filters every description. Syntax flexes with pressure: long lyrical sentences for starlit calm, clipped fragments when patrols near (“They won’t find this place”). Dialogue is sparse but idiosyncratic: Ezra’s pennies rattle as sonic calling card; his line “Resistance isn’t complicated...” carries street-poet cadence without ventriloquism. No head-hops; focalization remains cleanly anchored until the final inclusive “Always together” that expands to shared anthem.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third lyrical close, stable throughout; perceptual signature filters observation through musical ear (notes “dissolve into mist,” tonal patterns). Syntax flexes with emotional swell; no filter-verb tics. Dialogue minimal, natural, sub-textual: “You surprised fate.” Compression and patterned diction taught early (“clouds broke against invisible shores”) and paid off in final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited voice is稳定, with a perceptual signature attuned to soil, botanical impossibilities, and haptic seed contact. Syntax grows shorter under storm pressure; final paragraph releases into longer, breathy cadence mirroring rain. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Register stays within Yara’s trained lexicon; “luminous doubt” is the single near-lapse.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between measured observation and lyric uplift; no template cadence or repetition. Metaphors (“doubt glowed…like phosphorescence”) are singular and paid off. Information density high—each sentence carries botanic specificity or interior tilt. Minor scaffold: “she saw…and further back…” chain could trim one “she saw” without loss; stays under artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers close to Mei; perceptual signature—“rhythmically placid whisper,” “cerulean regret”—remains hers. Syntax lengthens or breathes with tide rhythm. No head-hops. Dialogue minimal, distinct: Tanaka’s “each syllable unfurling like a careful leaf” mirrors bonsai patience. Filter verbs rare; diction stays within Mei’s plausible lexicon.

    POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature rooted in Elena’s glass artistry (“molten gold” dawn, “glass-sharp light”). Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during decoding, lyrical flow at dawn. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments (“scorched testament” feels earned, not imposed). Minor deduction for one slightly overwritten phrase (“luminous, surviving heart”) that edges toward abstraction, but overall diction stays within plausible artisan lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Margaret’s sensory deprivation: narration avoids sound-based descriptions, favoring touch (“palm against glass”), sight (“blues and greens”), and thermal sensation. Voice modulates with intensity—short sentences during transcription (“Strike, touch, translate”), lyrical flow in reflection. Syntax mirrors her scientific-poetic duality: precise (“thermal sensors arranged in careful grids”) yet imagistic (“orchestra of the conservatory played on in colors beyond hearing”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)

No head-hopping; voice remains singular and consistent. The prose embodies her consciousness without filter-verb stacks or explanatory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single third, with Mira’s perceptual signature shaping every image (“keys yellowed like old teeth,” “dust motes swirling”).

Prose as character: syntax mirrors her controlled flame work.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in Marla’s phobia-filtered observations (“stars pressing down like cold witnesses”). Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during confrontation but retain lyrical texture. Dialogue distinguishes characters—Sandra’s manipulative defensiveness vs. Marla’s trembling certainty—without convergence.
