  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "luminous," "drifting resonance," "quiet resolve" recur without character-specific idiom. The prose carries elevated diction throughout ("luminous echo of his own artistry," "quiet canvas for creation") that fits a lyric mode but does not modulate under pressure—early canyon reflection and final workshop resolve share identical register. No dialogue. Purposeful compression is attempted in the two-shard structure, but filter verbs and summary statements ("He understood," "Kael felt," "He knew") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Mara's musician-survivor lens ("heat-mapping emotions," attention to resonant frequencies). Diction is consistent—slightly elevated, contemplative—though phrases like "a sign that beauty persisted" and "a promise of music yet to be born" drift toward abstractness under pressure. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature (silence, vibration, color as emotion) is character-specific, but the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("She realized she could rectify the silence") rather than letting the realization emerge through image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: elevated diction ("sip from pockets of trapped atmosphere like a miser hoarding coins") anchored in physical specifics. POV remains stable third-limited throughout. The perceptual signature—filtering the drowned city through burial and memory—is consistent. However, register occasionally drifts into abstracting poeticism ("twilight state of neither and both," "marrow" instead of bone) that feels more authorial than character-particular for an undertaker, and some figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching ("minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself"). These prevent 9+ but the voice remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV on Mara is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-declarative register ("gently persistent force, a whisper among the weary") but syntactic patterns recur: "The bell would chime," "The community listened," "The antique silver bell seemed to…" across multiple beats. Perceptual signature is generic (moonlight, flicker of lantern) without Mara-specific bias. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the grandmother's tale is summarized rather than voiced. Psychic distance remains steady but offers little modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—light, aperture, prisms—is consistent with Mira's role as camera obscura artist. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lucid dream," "silent blessing," "foggy lucidity") that reads more literary than character-particular. No head-hopping, and the lyric compression is purposeful, but the voice lacks the grit or micro-choices that would make the texture feel lived-in under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person POV with stable focalization on Elara. Diction is consistent and elevated ("quaking reverie," "fibrous as mycelium networks"), though occasionally it drifts toward poetic abstraction that obscures immediacy. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara sees geometry and temporal decay—but under peak stress the prose remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrator's voice is generic elevated prose ("his heart a steady drum," "the soil...seems to sigh") that converges with the thematic mood rather than filtering through the liberator's particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance is consistent but distant throughout—no embodied texture or character-specific diction. No dialogue is present; the single focalization avoids head-hopping. Minor register drift into abstract lyricism ("compass," "map of hope") without grounding in concrete perception. The piece reads as consistent committee voice rather than a singular, pressured consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic perception, accumulation metaphors, technical precision ("harmonic gaps," "frequency voids"). Diction is elevated but consistent, matching the narrator's specialized idiom. No head-hopping; all access flows through Lyra's filter. One friction: the narration occasionally drifts into abstract declaration ("a wound that wouldn't clot," "the battered marvel of it all") that tells emotional stakes rather than grounding them in embodied perception, slightly softening immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent—lyric, elevated, fairy-tale register with patterned repetition of signature phrases ("golden-hour portrait thief," "illuminated moments," "destiny's door"). No dialogue appears, so conversational tests do not apply. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; Lux notices emerald tiles, moonlight, and constellations in the same poetic register across calm and peak beats without modulation under stress. Psychic distance remains stable third-close with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose teaches its ornamental pattern early and sustains it, meeting experimental tolerance for lyric compression, but the voice does not degrade or sharpen when pressure would demand it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Marek's perception. Voice carries distinct texture: "Behold! The silica, purged of its memory, prepares to become transparent witness!" blends theatricality with technical craft vocabulary. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (touching dampness) to wider reflection (seven winters of suppressed mourning). Diction remains within Marek's lexicon—glassblower, engineer's widow—though "weighty lightness of an answer that wasn't also a question" and "ordinary alchemy" edge toward elevated register at closure. No dialogue present; monologue to machinery reads as character-specific coping mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature—"phobia-ridden," "trembling certainty," heightened awareness of heights and liquids—is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("vulnerability as shield," "circuits of strength," "map of hope") that exceeds Mira's immediate crisis and reads as authorial thesis rather than character voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional (Caela's intercom offer); the internal voice is coherent but occasionally lapses into therapy-speak ("firmly adaptive," "raw wound") that flattens urgency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature ("flaking gold leaf," "ambered hush") recurs but does not shift under pressure. Diction is elevated and consistent, though recycled phrase stems ("ambered hush" appears six times, "marbled hush" four times) flatten rhythm. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains fixed; the narrator's voice is legible but lacks intensity modulation during the traveler's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, with narrative distance matching J-3's robot perspective ("optical sensors locked," "processors began to amalgamate"). The prose has distinct texture through technical vocabulary and philosophical register that reads as purposeful rather than generic. Diction stays consistent within the established voice; elevated language ("spectral ribbons," "mundane mysticism") fits the contemplative tone. One notable strength: the perceptual signature filters experience through sensors, circuits, and chronometers, maintaining specificity even during surreal moments. Minor slip: "each moment a note in a larger symphony" leans slightly toward stock metaphor, though it's integrated into the violin motif.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature leans toward the professional (she notices timestamps, ticket stubs, "meticulously kept" records) and her interior voice remains consistent. Diction is serviceable but generic in emotional beats: "heart beat," "quiet freedom," "gentle smile." The manager and stagehand appear only in brief confession moments with no distinct speech patterns. Psychic distance stays controlled, and the prose avoids filter-verb stacks, but the voice lacks a character-particular texture that would elevate it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable in third-limited, and Silas's perceptual signature (vine-dresser idiom, attention to tendrils and blooms) is consistent. Dialogue from Silas and the youngest heir feels functional but lacks subtext—lines explain rather than pursue goals. Psychic distance is controlled, but voice flattens under pressure: "dry rustle" and "wisely pragmatic" repeat as labels without fresh embodiment. Free indirect style is clean, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("commemoration," "resonance") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV with stable close-third focalization. Perceptual signature is strong: mechanically warm traces, frost patterns, magnetic whispers, dimensions beyond waking. Diction remains consistently lyric-technical ("spectral grids," "singularity of probability," "violet flower opening in the aether"). Chen's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, contrasting with Kael's formal reply. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the nexus bloom. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present (water as "tide of forgotten melodies," shadows "danced between notes not yet played"), but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated, abstract register ("spectral diagrams," "temporal pockets where time had folded") that risks floating above Mara's immediate experience. Filter verbs ("She understood now," "She had learned") are frequent in reflective beats. Psychic distance widens during explanation ("The diva hadn't wanted to be freed; she wanted to be remembered"), flattening the final turn. No dialogue on the page to assess. Texture is lyric and consistent, though some constructions lean toward narrative summary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The single-POV narration maintains stable third-person close distance and a consistent lyric register. The prose carries a meditative texture appropriate to the oracle's reflective state. However, the voice relies on repeated conceptual abstractions ("swaying certainties," "peripherally aware," "auroral sorrow") without grounding them in action or perception that changes under stress, and the diction occasionally drifts into thematic essay mode in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—appraisal vocabulary, religious skepticism—colors the narration ("beaded like rosary beads he didn't believe in," "appraising the hysteria"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, several phrases drift into elevated register ("phantom looms and ghost shifts," "memory's mass") that feel more authorial than character-particular. No dialogue, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply. Compression and rhythm are controlled, but the lexicon sometimes outpaces Elias's established blue-collar texture.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable distance with lyric diction ("paper-thin boundary," "breathing organism of memory"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—poetic, reflective register. However, compression and patterned syntax lean heavily on stock phrases ("drift of untold seasons" recurs five times, "regenerative silence" four times) without fresh variation. Purposeful repetition is taught but borders on template cadence in cumulative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and Mira's perceptual signature (measuring time in breaths, noticing breathing patterns) is consistent. Diction is character-particular ("cautious exuberance," "hush of dreaming roots") with purposeful repetition of the "dreaming roots" motif. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at peak moments (the suspension, the memories surfacing). Filter verbs ("believed," "felt") are voice-motivated. Eleanor's single line of dialogue—Mira's mother's name—is goal-driven (reconnection) but lacks subtext; it declares the miracle rather than implying it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a distinct textural signature: "bronze quiet," "moth wings," "dragons seeming to move across the weft." Diction is consistently elevated and somber, matching the archival setting. The repeated phrase "sensitively perceptive" and formulaic constructions like "that particular hush of contained memory" signal slight template reliance. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The voice modulates appropriately with the discovery beats, though peak moments lack rhythmic intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tight to Mei Lin's perceptual filter; the prose reflects her kitchen background and newfound clarity through phrases like "orchestrated it by directing flow" and "a heartbeat of glass and brass." Tomás's brief dialogue ("Found it on the ferry... meaning he knew and wouldn't speak") carries subtext and advances plot without filter leakage. Psychic distance is well-controlled, with selective sensory detail (fortune cookie crumbs, wet stone, twilight-colored shell) anchored in her present stakes. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Miriam's perceptual signature (sound, color, theological framing). However, elevated diction at peak beats—"rhetorical device sharp enough to cut assumptions from their roots," "dimensional anchor groaned"—drifts from intimate craft voice toward abstract register. The loop pedal's mechanics are legible and voice-motivated, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the exorcism, wider for the monastery frame). No head-hopping, but some phrases read as writerly ornament rather than Miriam's lived idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. However, diction drifts toward elevated abstractions ("dawn's alchemy," "patience of ice") that feel ornamental rather than character-particular, and key interiority relies on filter-heavy constructions ("she could feel exhaustion curling," "she smiled, knowing"). Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or urgency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Voice leans toward elevated register throughout ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness," "cognition's knot"), creating a uniform lyric texture that does not modulate under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing. Diction stays within an abstract philosophical lexicon but lacks the specificity or rhythmic control that would elevate to high bands. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elara's perception. Diction leans lyric ("cotton silence," "filament of hush") throughout, which reads as consistent voice rather than register drift. However, perceptual signature is generic; the narrator's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. The drum maker's explanation ("silence could be carved like wood") and the backward-song mechanics arrive as exposition rather than filtered through Elara's understanding, creating a small psychic distance slip at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (barometric pressures, wind velocities, pattern recognition) distinguishes his attention. Diction is controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing ("bordered on obsession," "the layered tranquility of his purpose") reads writerly rather than character-rooted. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; focalization is clean. The voice modulates from tense (rooftop chase) to contemplative (courtyard) to resolute (ending) with purpose. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift in peak reflection ("nurture integrity in solitude") slightly distances the reader, but overall distance and psychic control are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice remains stable and carries a consistent lyric register, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful reverence," "impossible choices shimmer like mirages") that feels authored rather than filtered through the poet's lived perception. Perceptual signature is generic—"he wondered," "he realized," "he felt"—without character-specific bias. No dialogue. The prose texture is uniform across emotional beats, missing the modulation or compression under pressure that would elevate voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (acoustic focus) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("magnificent simplicity," "collective song," "testament to the power of listening") that reads as authorial rather than character-filtered. The voice lacks syntactic variety; many paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating template cadence. No dialogue appears to test differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single close-third POV maintains stable distance and a lyric, meditative register throughout. Diction is elevated and poetic ("moth's wing," "fragile bridge," "borrowed frequency"), consistent with the dealer's artisan self-concept. The voice is distinctive but leans on repeated sentence stems ("I…", "The…") and recycled constructions ("half truth," "professionally thorough"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Under peak emotional moments the register remains uniform rather than degrading or sharpening, flattening the sense of pressure. Perceptual signature is present (static as sensory method, affectionate detachment), but lacks the rhythmic modulation that would elevate voice control into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable single-focalized through Lena with no head-hopping. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction drifts into elevated register ("shrewd seaside cargo broker," "cautious exuberance," "guardian angel") that feels imposed rather than Lena's lived idiom. Caleb's dialogue ("calling her a guardian angel") and the narrator's phrasing converge in tone. The final third leans heavily into thematic declaration, diluting the voice's specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression ("a remembering," "dusk's last tag") that reads as pattern-taught rather than artifact. POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. The girl's traced-air speech and berry-dye fingers offer distinct texture. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Kael's likely lexicon ("dialects he couldn't parse," "citation of lineage") without clear POV anchoring. Perceptual signature—Kael notices reeds, weavings, shadows—is selective and character-specific. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara's illustrator lens notes phosphorescent algae, petrified feathers—but does not modulate under peak stress. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("tectonic breath," "audible fossils," "liquid architecture") yet lacks variation in rhythm when pressure peaks. Filter verbs are sparse. The voice is distinct but syntactically uniform: many sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrases, creating a measured cadence that does not accelerate during the Gasp sequence. Purposeful compression is visible but not pattern-taught early enough to exempt it from monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, incantatory rhythm ("silvered droplets into silent music," "a quiet symphony of stone and root") that suits the conjurer's perspective. Distance is consistent, though the vocabulary occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dovetail," "fractal of grief and hope") that reads more authorial than character-native. No head-hopping. Psychic distance remains close enough to track Vesper's sensory experience (cool stone, warm pulse) while maintaining lyric remove. Perceptual signature is present but abstract: she notices patterns, equations, constellations of meaning. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately, slowing for ritual and quickening slightly at the doorway's emergence. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but serve the dreamy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Mara, with clean focalization and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in touch and sense memory. The prose carries her idiom: "Her hands remembered every rivet, every rusted elbow joint." However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels less embodied—"sapphire-hush moments," "the library's bones," "dark arteries"—creating mild register tension during peak beats. The boy's minimal interior access is appropriate to the distance, but the lack of any dialogue flattens opportunities for subtext and voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and grounded in Elena's observational mode; diction ("circuitously sincere," "reluctant metamorphosis") matches her studied, reflective stance. Perceptual signature (leaf edges, vine posture, root grip) is character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable third-close. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor slips: "a quiet ceremony of renewal" and "gentle chaos of nature" edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds Elena's established lexicon under pressure, but the effect is contained and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV; focalization remains stable. Voice carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("haggard awe," "wryly earnest," "thresh meaning") that fits the painter's reflective stance. The scavenger's one line of dialogue ("the rain trails had led him to the ruin, where the paint had bled into the stone") is serviceable but generic. Perceptual signature is evident in the painter's attention to textures and colors, though the syntactic rhythm flattens across emotional beats—many paragraphs open with "She" + past-tense verb, creating template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited stays with Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic-mystical ("shimmering," "luminescent," "radiant flares") without character-specific bias. Diction tilts elevated ("clairvoyant," "latent magic," "symphony of crystal pillars") but remains legible and consistent. No dialogue to assess. The pilgrim's silent presence and Lira's interior remain summary-level rather than immediate perception under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched," "realized") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV (archivist) with stable third-limited distance and no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("reactively visionary," "negative spaces that defined a shape," "cartography of silence"), fitting an archivist's lexicon. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing could belong to any contemplative professional. Sentence stems recur ("She collected," "She accepted," "She recorded," "She summoned," "She placed," "She returned") without rhythmic variation, flattening momentum. The navigator's speech appears once ("This, he said, was all that remained") without distinct idiom. Orientation debt (late anchoring of who/where) and cross-cap from Q2 applied, capping this category at 7.8; absent that, internal voice control would still plateau mid-6s due to template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-literary texture with purposeful compression: "when the city exhaled its secrets like smoke through manhole covers," "Her maps hadn't been of places, but of absences." Psychic distance modulates effectively from close interiority ("Her reason warred with instinct") to wider atmospheric sweeps. Diction remains largely within a heightened literary register appropriate to Elara's "analytically artistic mind," though "经纬度" (Chinese characters for longitude/latitude) breaks idiom and locale without explanation—likely a generation artifact that jars credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but Lira's perceptual signature is generic: "her heart was courageously kind" and "she realized" constructions repeat without embodied texture. Diction remains consistent but lacks character-specific rhythm—sentences often begin with "She" or "The," creating template cadence. No dialogue appears. Fisherman interiority is asserted ("his silence a heavy shroud") without dramatized access, reading as distant omniscience rather than focalized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register fitting Althea's ancient perspective ("dimensionally aware mind," "quantum foam between realities"). However, diction frequently drifts into academic abstractions ("harmonic alignment with the spatial rebellion") that feel more explanatory than embodied. Psychic distance stays consistent, but the prose often prioritizes metaphysical vocabulary over sensory immediacy. Under peak stress (the dissolution), syntax compresses appropriately, but the perceptual signature remains more conceptual than character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Sam's perceptual signature: "breach of pure geometry," "deathly vitality," "chemical persistence of memory" establish a voice balancing adolescent precision with metaphorical reach. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Sam's "My family too" and the director's response carry subtext and shift power. Minor register wobble: "ethical algebra" and "ratio that kept a soul intact" feel slightly elevated for a fourteen-year-old's real-time thought, though the voice-motivated intellectualism mostly coheres. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is distinct and consistent—lyric, elevated, with a contemplative register. Psychic distance remains stable and no head-hopping occurs. However, the prose leans on repetitive syntactic stems ("She recorded," "She imagined," "She traced," "She felt") and template phrasing ("Each hue represented," "Each map became," "Each beat a measure"). Under pressure, the diction does not modulate; the contemplative tone persists without intensification or compression. Filter verbs ("imagined," "felt") stack in high-density passages without urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the survivor notices corrugated metal texture, vent-hole confessions, tidal marks. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("ghost with fingerprints," "topology of erasures"), though occasional register drift into elevated abstraction ("administrative erasure," "cosmic scale") feels slightly unmotivated for a character living in containers. Narrative distance modulates purposefully (closer during the poison-label recognition, wider during tidal summaries). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats. Minor template cadence in some paragraph openings ("The survivor...," "He...") but not pervasive enough to flatten rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent elevated register. However, perceptual signature is weak—Elias's way of noticing doesn't feel character-specific; phrases like "inside the whisper of closing pages" and "the breath before speech" recur as lyric decoration without embodying a mind under pressure. The piece uses filter verbs moderately ("he realized," "he finally saw") in moments that should carry immediacy, and diction occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("ephemeral compass spinning toward whatever answer you needed") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited anchored in Mira's perceptual filter. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific ("liquid sky," "orderly intuitive"). The piece maintains appropriate psychic distance and no head-hopping occurs. The child's understanding glance and Mira's embodied handling of the stone chip demonstrate clean focalization. Minor: some lines approach elevated register ("defiant roar against the tide of privatization") that slightly exceeds the established voice texture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction remains lunar-pastoral throughout ("regolith," "stardust," "dawning hush"), though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the weight of the space age in the stillness"). Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the inspector notices the bloom, hourglass, and horizon, yet her way of seeing does not reveal idiosyncratic bias or hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Miren; perceptual signature (vibration, temperature, refracted light patterns) is distinct and sustained under pressure. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Kael's lines pursue understanding, Miren's carry magnetic authority without exposition. Diction remains controlled—no register drift. Very minor: "magnetic calm that drew projects toward her like filings to a magnet" stacks vehicle and tenor redundantly in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Kael's perceptual signature (cartographer's eye, polyglot's ear) filters details consistently: he reads condensation as script, knows "the Thaw-tongue word" by heart. Diction is controlled and poetic without major register drift. The piece uses purposeful compression ("To find where the rivers began, he'd followed their silence upstream") and patterned syntax ("A spiral, then a line, then a dot"). However, the final third employs repeated sentence stems ("To find where the rivers begin…") across multiple lines, creating template cadence that flattens rhythm under peak pressure, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct in its lyric register—"wild hush," "cobblestones remembered," "ghost town breathed"—and the elevated diction fits the three-century timeframe and mythic stakes. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming from close interiority ("feeling the wild hush") to wider narration of the town's response. However, several beats recycle identical syntactic stems: "Kael had been listening," "Kael had memorized," "Kael stood beneath it now," "Kael began to walk," "Kael walked on." The repetition of "infinitely patient" (three times) and "wild hush" (three times without sufficient reweighting between first and second use) creates a template cadence that flattens momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lira throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (scientific framing, urgency-driven selection). The prose modulates from clinical urgency ("oxygen gauge trembled at red") to lyric intensity ("salt and starlight") as pressure peaks. Two frictions lower the score: occasional filter-verb stacks ("Her fingers found," "Instinct screamed") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, and late-story intrusions into the captain's interiority without section break create brief POV leakage that weakens distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but psychic distance is uncontrolled: the prose alternates between close register ("He knew that soon they would find the bodies") and distant lyricism ("The hush lingered. Forever, the lighthouse stands") without purposeful modulation. Perceptual signature is absent; the narrator's diction is uniform poetic abstraction ("copperlight repose," "sustained impossibilities") that does not reflect the protagonist's mind under pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed to sustain," "began to hover") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The final paragraphs shift into omniscient summary ("When the search party finally arrived, they would read…") that breaks the established POV frame. Sentence openings repeat stem patterns: "The lattice…" "He…" "The door…" across adjacent lines without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual signature leans heavily on atmospheric description ("breath hitched," "weight of centuries") without character-particular idiom. The ghost's dialogue ("I have come to repay a debt") is formal and generic. Diction remains consistent but elevated throughout—no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear frequently without voice-motivated purpose. The prose texture is uniform: every beat receives the same lyric treatment, flattening urgency. No head-hopping or tense drift, meeting baseline competence.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing defaults to elevated diction ("pale orchid," "ghost-light," "luminous thread") without character-specific selectivity or bias. Psychic distance stays far throughout; no interior contradiction or embodied perception during high-pressure beats. Diction is uniformly poetic, reading as authorial overlay rather than focalizer's idiom. No dialogue appears. Register is consistent but abstract, favoring stock lyricism over concrete sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, perceptual signature is consistent (Lina's noticing filtered through reverence, archaeology, and longing), and diction remains within her register—concrete, slightly elevated, poetic without jarring academic leaps. Narrative distance modulates appropriately: closer during the fragment discovery, broader during the orchard's description as living archive. Minor register drift: phrases like "cautious enchantment," "living archive," and "continuous unfolding" edge toward essayistic abstraction rather than embodied thought, especially under the emotional pressure of the final paragraphs. No head-hopping, tense is stable, and the prose reflects Lina's mind and state throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("liminal hour," "surgical precision," "muscle memory of a hand holding chalk") that suits the contemplative futuristic-nostalgia tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic literary phrasing ("fossil of commerce," "hymn to obsolete practices") that could apply to many settings. Mira's single line of dialogue ("We're all looking for meaning in the margins nowadays") echoes Kael's interiority too closely, suggesting voice convergence rather than distinct speech. Perceptual signature is present (Kael notices chalk stubs, grid positions, the worn clipboard) but remains consistent throughout without modulating under stress. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited and the perceptual signature is consistent—poetic, attuned to silence and light. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("galaxy-chart embroiderer," "adjacent possibilities," "echoed silence") that reads as authorial rather than character-specific. Purposeful compression (e.g., "whispered secrets," "blue-white heart") is present but the rhythm flattens under metaphor density in high-pressure beats. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Filter verbs and stock metaphors ("breath caught," "heart beat in time") appear in peak moments without fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is grief-soaked and metaphor-dense ("voices like wind chimes made of broken glass and memory"). Diction is purposeful and sustained, though the elevated register risks distancing the reader during peak emotional beats (e.g., "the fierce tenderness of the message cutting through my denial" tells more than it shows). No dialogue, so those bullets are waived. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor deduction for filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("I felt the unsent letters flutter inside my chest").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: translator's habit of parsing codes, layered time under anesthetic, lexicon balancing technical (fentanyl, polyp) and lyric. POV stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in coral-tracing, wide in atrium dissolve). Minor register drift: "colonized his silence" and "archipelagos despite ourselves" elevate slightly beyond peak-stress diction, though voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual filters (fog, light, tactile handling of tools) reflecting Lyra's artistic focus. Diction is elevated but consistent: "swirled," "pulsed," "lattice of fiber-optic strands." Two patterns weaken voice: recycled sentence openings ("She unrolled," "She projected," "She danced," "She realized," "She vowed," "She packed," "She walked") create template cadence across the middle third, and figurative language ("mercury," "skeletal hands," "bridge between past and present") appears in most sentences without building a taught pattern. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("bewitched," "nested awakenings," "boundless curiosity") that feels more thematic than character-particular. The visitor's single line of dialogue is not distinct from narrative voice. Perceptual signature is weak: Elena's noticing does not reveal bias or professional priority. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched," "realized") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, applying −0.5 in Q7 and capping 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Aris's botanical lens ("cathedral of controlled chaos," "lexicon of lateral vines"). The coded dialogue between Aris and Chen carries subtext and goal pursuit. Distance modulates appropriately under pressure (tightening when auditors arrive). However, some diction drifts into elevated register ("linguistic subversion," "neural pathways as revenue streams") that feels more authorial than Aris-in-crisis. The perceptual signature is consistent: Aris notices ladybugs, seed textures, pollinator pathways.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person narration maintains consistent distance and a distinct lyric texture ("fossilized moon," "spire of shell"). Perceptual signature is present but static across centuries without degradation under stress. Psychic distance does not modulate with pressure. Repetitive syntactic patterns ("She sang of," "She knew," "She had") create template cadence (−0.5). Diction occasionally elevates beyond the POV's immediate stress ("photosynthesis of sorrow") in peak moments without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization and a consistent lyric register. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature; Lyra's way of noticing remains generic and interchangeable with any caretaker in any museum. Diction remains elevated and uniform across beats without modulation under pressure. The repeated template cadence ("She knew that…," "She realized that…," "She understood that…") flattens voice and creates a mechanical rhythm that undercuts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is controlled and the narration maintains Elara's POV without head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("harmonic resurrection theory," "phrased in Jorvik, they became binding equations") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Kess's single line of dialogue ("I was wrong… afraid you were right") carries subtext but the rest of the reconciliation is narrated rather than spoken. Psychic distance is stable but the prose doesn't modulate rhythm or texture under peak pressure (the wait, the reply).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature (machinist's eye on valves, ridges, pressure points) is consistent. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("throbbed with the slow, rhythmic breath," "dappled resolve") that edges past Alia's likely lexicon under stress. Dialogue is minimal (council murmurs, no direct speech), so naturalism and subtext tests are untested. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "realized") cluster but do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias filters sensory input through music and light. Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, with purposeful compression in dust-mote metaphor and "withered song of wood." No head-hopping. Distance control is stable. However, peak-stress moments ("fragile trust solidify") lean toward abstract assertion rather than voice-specific texture, and the final paragraph's rhythm flattens into summary. Experimental compression is taught and legible, but does not fully charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (prisms, fractured hush, featherly determination). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("prayer," "reverence," "legend") that blurs urgency, and the patterned repetition (threshold, distance, grain) reads as taught motif rather than voice-driven necessity. The father's voice and the logbook provide purposeful elision that primes the ending, partially offsetting the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Iyana throughout. Diction is elevated and poetic ("landscape astrologer," "stratigraphy of belonging," "shadowseam wonder"), consistent with a scholarly character but occasionally drifting into decorative abstraction ("geometry ghosts," "softly ingenious"). The AI Orpheus's voice ("its cadence like tide through coral") is distinct but brief. Perceptual signature is present in how Iyana reads the city as celestial patterns, though under peak pressure the prose remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency. Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("she felt," "she saw it") appear frequently where more immediate rendering would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited holds steady; Lira's perception is consistent and voice-specific ("salt-soaked heart," "earth's glittering throat"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with fantasy-register vocabulary that fits the invented occupation. However, lines like "sweet sorrow that celebrated the cycle of forgetting and remembrance" and "melancholy joy" drift toward abstraction. No dialogue is present. Focalization remains clean, and the prose texture is distinctive, though peak beats favor poetic summary over embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ezra; psychic distance controlled. Diction carries a consistent analytical texture: "orchestrate serendipity," "mental chessboard," "reverse-engineered." The phrase "lightly attentive" recurs as both POV filter and descriptor for secondary characters, which reads as prompt-element insertion but remains voice-motivated. No dialogue except the couple's brief exchange about the bishop, which distinguishes their voices and carries subtext (the word "sacrifice" does double duty). Perceptual signature is consistent—Ezra notices patterns, coordinates, variables—though it flattens under peak moments rather than fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    Narrative distance is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("obsidian grace," "perpetual fledging," "cosmic tapestry") that exceeds Lyra's plausible lexicon under stress. Perceptual signature is generic; Lyra notices "silvered leaves" and "dew-laden petals" without character-specific bias. Template cadence pervades: "She had learned…," "She realized…," "She danced…" recur without variation. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as a narrator explaining Lyra rather than inhabiting her.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, anchored in the glazier's reflective register. However, the prose relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("noctilucent reckonings," "tempered pane," "clear complexity") that feel imposed rather than voice-motivated. The glazier's perceptual signature—seeing stories in cracks, reading between lines—is declared but not dramatized through specific, idiosyncratic noticing. Diction stays within a narrow literary register without modulation under pressure, and the lack of dialogue removes one test entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds consistently; distance and tense remain stable. Perceptual signature appears (fire language, burn pattern reading) but diction drifts into elevated literary register throughout ("exchanged innocence," "choreography," "embodiment"). Under peak emotional beats, syntax remains uniform and ornate rather than degrading with stress. No dialogue present to judge. Voice reads as authorial rather than character-particular, with recursive poetic phrasing ("hard softness," "simple act of remembering") that flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a measured, lyric-scientific register ("cathedral of limestone," "calculus of renewal") that fits the logical-dreamer frame, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("serene upheaval," "fibonacci sequence of shells") that risks distancing the reader from immediacy. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (lucidly watchful, trial balloons, decorations) teach a rhythm, but the voice feels more like authorial synthesis than Kael's particular perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, so conversational naturalism is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated throughout ("sonic fossils," "residual pulse," "harmonic of guilt"), which fits the lyric-essay register but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sensitively perceptive nature translated chalk dust into feeling") that obscures concrete perception. The phrase "sensitively perceptive" recurs seven times, creating template cadence and synonym churn. Interior texture is consistent but generic—Mira's way of noticing reads as authorial summary rather than character-particular perception. No dialogue appears; the piece relies entirely on narrated reflection and description.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register that remains consistent throughout. Perceptual signature is present but generic—prisms, whispered dreams, dusky harmony—without character-specific bias. The prose carries a distinct texture (prism parapet after rain, borrowed heartbeat, echoing terrace) that recurs purposefully. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but do not flatten immediacy given the lyric mode. No dialogue; voice modulates minimally across beats. Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon, though the elevation risks abstraction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is controlled with a formal, lyric register consistent with the negotiator's reflective stance. Perceptual signature is present (e.g., "slow wheeling of the heavens," "flawed beauty of the night"). No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. However, elevated phrasing occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("forgotten promise," "fragile future") that feels curator-voiced rather than character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Vesper's perception throughout. Diction is controlled and elevated ("fractured grace," "ghostly melody"), fitting the lyric-textural lens. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is visible in Vesper's focus on cracks, echoes, and relics. Minor register drift occurs in late exposition ("visitors would pause, hearing a sound never known"), shifting briefly to external summary, but the narrator's core voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices sound, silence, and movement in poetic register ("footsteps silent as memory," "snowflakes fell like forgotten syllables"). Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Elara's sensory experience. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor that clashes with moment-to-moment urgency—"bodily poetic," "alarming serenity," "poetic finality"—terms that feel externally imposed rather than voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative stance remains coherent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV third-person focalization holds; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("traced phantom serifs," "knotting fishing line with deliberate clumsiness") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Adrian's lived thought ("epiphanies of the dome's flickering bulbs," "meteor hush fell—not from space, but from realization"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs ("he intended," "he had grown sick") cluster without clear voice motivation. Purposeful compression in the puppet-show sequence works, but some lines read as thematic essay rather than Adrian's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person maintains stable distance with a lyric, elevated register consistent with Esme's contemplative stance. Perceptual signature is present (she "recognized it as an interrupted cadence," calculates angles, reads the landscape through entomological memory) but the diction occasionally drifts into expository abstraction—"mathematics of loss: each extinct pollinator erased seventeen plant memories"—that feels more like authorial essay than character thought under pressure. Rhythm modulates appropriately, lengthening in reflective passages and tightening at the moth-wing and monarch beats. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent artisan register ("lost wax training taught her that absence defines form"). Voice modulates with emotion (weeping, smiling) and diction reflects her craft. However, "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" recur as author-inserted labels rather than character-owned perception; under peak stress, she remains fully articulate without compression. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally shifts into elevated summary ("the symphony of the lost") that reads more like narrator commentary than her lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV, third-person limited with tight focalization: perception stays bound to Mara's pattern-seeking lens ("each tendril a timeline she could almost read"). Diction is consistent—lyric, compressed, image-dense—and modulates appropriately under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads the world as recursive symbol. No head-hopping. A few lines approach over-ornamentation ("gift that felt like trying to drive by watching the rearview mirror") but remain voice-motivated. The prose maintains its ethereal-grit texture through calm and storm beats without flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Kael as focalizer throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct archaic-scholarly texture with purposeful diction ("devotion," "schematic essence," "gloaming"), though some register drift occurs when elevated abstractions ("unknown mathematics," "cosmic indifference") sit awkwardly next to concrete observations. Perceptual signature is present but generic to the "astronomer" archetype rather than character-specific. Several filter verbs ("believed," "realized," "suspected") dull immediacy in peak beats (the eighth night, the final activation). Psychic distance remains consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately across reflective and action beats, but sentence stems show minor repetition ("The tile," "Kael") that flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. The voice carries a distinct texture—elevated, precise diction ("coalesced," "helices," "glyphs of intention")—that suits the liminal setting. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing during peak beats ("the architecture of empathy itself"), dulling immediacy (−0.3). Elara's dialogue is minimal and lacks subtext; the exchange reads more like demonstration than goal-driven conflict. Perceptual signature is present (silver breath, reality shifts as clock) but the syntax remains uniform across emotional beats, missing the rhythm modulation expected under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature filters through his craft ("calloused from grinding glass," "metal cold as a glacier's memory"). Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("ghost-scent of apples and stardust," "starlight sap"). Some register drift occurs in abstractions like "the space between what was and what could never be" and "the boundary between seeker and sought," which feel writerly rather than grounded in Kael's embodied experience. Under peak pressure (the breath synchronization), compression is minimal and the prose remains ornate when tighter syntax might heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in the mender's craft lexicon (chisels, resin, silver wire, quartz eyes, graft, sap). Diction is controlled and voice-specific in the opening and middle passages. The dialogue between mender and daughter is goal-driven and advances the plot, though the mender's reply is overly articulate for spontaneous speech ("without thinking" undercuts the polished phrasing). Psychic distance shifts purposefully during the locket discovery and the final threshold reflection. However, the closing passage ("In the years that followed...") shifts into summary narration with a flatter, more distanced register that loses the mender's immediate texture. The daughter's final line converges with the narrative voice, diluting character distinction at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance; Evers's perceptual signature favors cosmic scale and memorial language. Voice modulates purposefully: compressed clarity in the bathroom, lyric expansion at the final tree. Lexicon is consistent—"nonlinear inheritance," "simply complicated," "brightened"—and the elevated register fits a curator of astral phenomena. Weakness: several beats rely on stock constructions ("trembling palm," "flood of understanding," "terrible beauty") and filter verbs cluster in the middle section ("realized," "understood," "seemed"). The bathroom breakthrough paragraph stacks explanation where scene pressure could carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the metaphoric register ("forgotten organ," "mute chords," "golden chords") is consistent throughout. However, diction drifts into generic elevated prose ("Color returned to his cheeks," "plucked a volume at random") that lacks Elara's particular perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the botanist's "murmuring thanks in a language that had not been spoken for centuries" is told rather than rendered. The "unheard symphony" frame is coherent but leans on repetition of the same lexical cluster without fresh inflection under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent and the voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic poetic phrasing ("narrative threads," "sensory echo," "mosaic of two lives") that flattens specificity. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-particular; Mira's way of noticing reads more authorial than idiosyncratic. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are acceptable within the chosen register.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering the investigation through Elara's professional lexicon ("spectroscopic analysis," "semantic bomb," "temporal ambiguity") and her perceptual bias toward pattern and precision. Diction is purposeful and elevated—"phoenix that never existed," "submarine precision," "captured starlight"—creating a distinct archival-scholarly texture, though some phrases verge on over-polish ("warmly methodical" repeated verbatim, "defusing a semantic bomb" feels slightly self-aware). No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests are inapplicable. Psychic distance remains controlled; Elara's interiority is concrete ("her fingers still tingling") and the narrative never leaks into other minds. Register occasionally drifts toward decorative metaphor ("surgical precision," "sonic ghost") in peak beats, and the recycled phrase "warmly methodical" (used thrice) creates minor template echo, but the voice remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices vibrations, traces cracks, listens to the stone. Diction is elevated and poetic ("hammered repose," "gentle luminescence," "ripple-mark mapkeeper") and remains voice-coherent across the text. However, register is uniform and somewhat abstract; under peak pressure (the first bloom's failure, the second bloom's initiation) syntax and rhythm do not modulate—every beat reads at the same lyric pitch. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression is present (the energy beings' nature, the ancient mapkeepers) and legible. Minor penalty: "hammered repose" and "gentle luminescence" recur as static labels rather than evolving in context, creating slight template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is present—"fingers following constellations," retrocognitive flashes—but interior lexicon drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a custodian's idiom: "thistle of hope rooted in ruin," "precise geometry of repair." No dialogue. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose voice converges toward a consensus literary register rather than character-specific texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("summer-quill weighted with something unnamed," "deepening hush of observatory settled around her like a cloak"). Focalization remains controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—attention to shadow lengths, crystal fragments, storm-scent—is consistent. However, interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction ("preemptively nostalgic grief," "identity was not sculpted from experience") that feels more like prompt echo than character-particular thought. Diction is largely apt, though some phrases ("deepening hush," "space between words where meaning lived") recur without evolving function, bordering on ornamental repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a purposeful lyric register ("void, a tapestry with no stars," "wordless chant, echoing the mantra") that suits a wandering artisan-protagonist, though it drifts toward stock poeticism ("gravity of hopelessness thick as tar") under peak beats rather than tight perceptual signature. Psychic distance is consistent, and sentence rhythm modulates (short bursts at the fire-spin, longer cadence in the final walk). No dialogue; voice remains coherent, if somewhat generic in its metaphoric choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV distance is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("warm and observant," "soft current"). Perceptual signature leans heavily into the chronicler's observational idiom. The brother's single line of dialogue ("spoke of returning one day…") is reported rather than quoted, flattening his voice. Under peak emotional pressure, the prose maintains its rhythmic cadence without compression or roughening, reducing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and diction ("intangibly tangible," "stretched knot") attempts a lyric texture. However, abstract phrasing dominates peak beats where concrete sensory particulars would sharpen pressure. The father and protagonist lack distinct speech patterns; no dialogue appears to test voice differentiation. Perceptual signature is present (silence-tasting) but mechanically repeated without modulation under stress, and the phrase "intangibly tangible" contradicts itself without purposeful ambiguity that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited through Kael; psychic distance is controlled, with perceptual signature evident in her focus on meters, glass, and harmonic balance. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching her specialized role. The diplomat's interior is inferred through externals (drumming, flinching, tears) without head-hopping. Two weaknesses: "fluidly logical" as a repeated phrase feels like template cadence rather than character-specific thought, and the diplomat's dialogue ("I've been trying to outrun quiet my whole life") lands as too articulate for someone mid-breakdown, sounding written rather than spoken. Filter verbs ("could see," "watched") appear but remain sparse and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent narrative distance; the lore keeper's perceptual signature (reading graffiti as strata, matching ruby pulse to glyphs) gives the voice texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sally forth," "midwifing tomorrow") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted, and the final paragraphs shift into omniscient summary ("a child born under the double moons would soon dream") without clear motivation. No dialogue present to judge. The voice is controlled but not distinctive enough under peak pressure to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the keeper, but psychic distance is inconsistent—early paragraphs offer close sensation ("calloused hands"), while later beats drift into distant summary ("She realized," "She decided"). Dialogue appears in two brief exchanges; the keeper's "Because shadows are the only breaths..." and "Breathing is a bridge we build" sound like thematic placards rather than goal-driven speech with subtext. Diction repeatedly uses "loaded emptiness" and synonym variants ("tender," "careful," "fragile") without distinct perceptual signature. Filter verbs cluster in the middle third ("she recognized," "she knew," "she realized") without voice motivation, but the spread does not reach the stack threshold for the global 9+ disallow.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent, with a lyric-philosophical register ("probabilistic bond," "waveform collapsing") that fits the sci-fi premise. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the moment's urgency—"virtuously mischievous" and "shadowseam wonder" feel authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are non-applicable. The prose modulates with pressure (short bursts during the bolt turn) but filter verbs ("knew," "realized," "wondered") cluster in reflective passages without always anchoring to present stimuli. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV distance is stable and third-limited, but the narrative voice is generic literary-sepia without perceptual signature: "his heart a drum," "eloquent silence," "bridge of intuition" read as imported diction rather than the protagonist's idiom under pressure. Repeated phrases ("golden shadows" ×7, "first yawn of evening" ×4, "eloquently silent" ×3, "bridge of intuition" ×3) create template cadence rather than purposeful variation. Filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he listened," "he stared," "he smiled") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: Aldric's noticing defaults to generic fantasy diction ("luminescent," "transmuted," "harmonic") without character-specific bias. Register drift appears in phrases like "factually mystical truth" and "fluid geometry that defied logic but felt utterly true," which read as prompt echo rather than lived perception. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through Marianne's archival expertise. Perceptual signature is distinct: "dust told her the sequence of events," patina matched to inner documents, the envelope sealed "before the dust of history could claim it." Diction stays consistent—"tactfully hopeful," "specialized grief," "dust patterns Marianne could read like a map"—with rhythm modulating between archival precision and emotional weight. The social worker remains speculative ("she imagined") without head-hopping. Minor: "magnify small kindnesses" phrase recurs without fresh coloring in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Voice carries a consistent lyric-noir texture ("flickering like dying stars," "starlight coded in water"), and diction remains within Mara's plausible register. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific; descriptions could fit any resourceful rebel. No dialogue on the page to assess. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent but generic—every image filtered through the same elevated, misty lens without character-specific bias. Register drifts into abstract poetic diction ("vested hush," "quietly vivid," "negative space") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Template cadence runs dominate: "The [subject] [verb], [gerund] [object]" across a dozen lines. No internal texture shifts under pressure; the narrator's syntax remains uniformly ornate regardless of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts between lyric register ("ashen skyborne arbor," "cocoon of silken roots") and flat exposition ("The map points toward the forgotten grove"). Narrative certainty is unmodulated—Lira "realizes" and "knows" on cue without visible inference—and interiority consists of summary emotional labels ("her heart quickens," "mossy delight") rather than character-particular perception. Sentence openings recycle stems: "She decides," "She gathers," "She sprinkles," "She climbs."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual anchors ("Her fingers traced," "She kicked aside"). Diction is mostly controlled, with purposeful metaphoric texture ("cathedral of dead leaves," "choreography of air"). However, late-story lines drift into diagnostic abstraction ("learning to navigate by the moment, not the map") that feels authorial rather than character-voiced. The prose rhythm varies effectively, and no head-hopping occurs. Minor: "uncertainly certain" is repeated as a label without fresh embodiment in action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose sustains a distinct alchemist's register—"factually mystical," "balance, not belief," "the weight of one name, then two, then twelve"—and Elara's perceptual signature (kintsugi metaphors, zodiac-coin handling) remains consistent. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw now") appear at key turns but are voice-motivated within the reflective mode. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("meaning old-wise, meaning to grow") is taught early and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (sound-focused, metaphor-dense). Diction remains controlled: "modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "sob turning inside-out" create a cohesive voice. No dialogue appears; interiority is filtered through Kael's professional lens. Register is elevated but consistent with the mythic-folkloric tone. One hesitation: the narration occasionally edges toward explaining metaphor ("not as joy but as a wound that refused to close") where image alone might suffice, and the syntax maintains a steady lyric cadence even under pressure rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and sensory focus throughout, with some perceptual specificity ("each flicker an echo," "textured surface a tactile anchor"). However, diction drifts into abstraction and academic idiom under pressure ("proprioceptively enhanced," "geometry of grace," "coefficient," "variable"), which feels unmotivated by Elena's interiority. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood"), dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's shift to summary mode ("And as the light intensified, she understood") breaks the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent psychic distance. The voice carries a lyric, market-inflected texture ("elusively tangible," "between-worlds translator," "whisper-soft click") that fits the alchemist-market milieu. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("eternal instant," "anchors of intuition") that feels prompt-adjacent rather than organically voice-driven. The alchemist's brief dialogue ("such anchors...formed only when a keeper's will imprints") reads more expository than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present (memory, salt, grandmother's voice) but not deeply particularized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with perceptual signature: Marlon's professional eye ("every worn cable, every slipped pulley told its story") filters setting and ghost encounters. Diction remains character-consistent (e.g., "choreography" for dust, "structural grief"). The ringmaster's single line of dialogue ("We wound the clocks. We kept the time. But time forgot us.") carries voice and purpose. Minor register drift: "architectural longing, a structural grief" and "the weightless burden" elevate slightly above a technician's lexicon at peak beats, though they read as thematic coloring rather than POV break.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the surreal premise, but register occasionally drifts into generic poeticism ("the gentle displacement of certainty," "beautiful, terrible geometry") that could belong to any narrator. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; the voice sounds more like the world than Elara's particular consciousness. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression (elliptical transitions, dreamlike logic) is taught early and held through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions read like neutral catalog ("gilded skull," "translucent veils"). Diction drifts into elevated register ("restless specter," "crucible," "cipher") that feels authorial rather than earned by Kael's voice. The storm's "chorus of lost moments" and "burnished sorrow" repeat abstract poetic gestures without grounding in Kael's particular idiom. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a heightened, quasi-mythic register ("tinkersong wonder," "luminous melody," "ancient harmonics") that coheres across beats. Diction is consistent but occasionally slips into stock fantasy phrasing ("malignant flower," "serpent of corrosion"). The woman's single line of dialogue ("The song must play before the clock strikes twelve, or dawn will never come") reads stiff and expository. Perceptual signature is present (the repairman notices gears, vibrations, resonance) but not deeply idiosyncratic. No purposeful elision or POV withholding that serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices scent-molecules, "sensory detours," mineral breath. Diction remains controlled and voice-particular: "the water clarified, revealing layers of time stacked like pages." No head-hopping. One register slip: "explanation's architecture collapsed" and "coordinate where measurement dissolved into mystery" drift slightly elevated for a field collector, though her university affiliation provides some cover. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between intimate (fingertips, breathing) and reflective (survey team, valley history). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (sculptor's attention to grain, form, simplicity-from-complexity). Diction remains within her artisan idiom ("scaffold complexity with simplicity," "hands perpetually learning") without register drift. Purposeful compression in phrases like "timewoven alliances" and "turbine-hum reverie" is legible and pattern-taught. Minor slip: "The distinction no longer mattered; they were the same node" edges toward abstract declaration in a peak beat, slightly flattening the embodied voice under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited, stable distance throughout. Perceptual signature is present (visual artist's eye on light, color, glass) but diction drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "reckoning," "communion") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—emotional peaks ("breath caught") use stock embodiment. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative voice is coherent but not distinctly Sable's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    The POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and literary ("searing reverie," "retrocognitively trapped," "time-capsule accusation"), consistent with an archival voice but occasionally edging into abstraction. The dialogue in the parley—"These people were terrorists" / silent counter-arrangement—is economical and subtext-driven. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices symbols, beach debris, photographs) but does not modulate distinctly under stress. The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" and similar terms repeat as labels rather than varying through embodied perception, and the voice remains uniformly formal across emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Kael. Distance is consistent. Diction elevates at moments ("condensed breath of the town's final wish," "tapestry of possibilities") in a way that fits an alchemist-philosopher voice. However, syntactic variety is limited: many paragraphs open with "He" or "Kael" + verb, creating template cadence. Perceptual signature is generic—Kael notices concepts and symbolic objects rather than idiosyncratic sensory priorities. No dialogue appears. The voice reads competent but not distinct or rhythmically controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("green testament to forgotten horticulture," "velvet shroud") consistent with Elias's vocation. Perceptual signature reflects his archival mindset. However, diction occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction under pressure ("quiet disquiet wrapped in velvet") where concrete embodiment would sharpen voice. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") are used sparingly and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register with fantasy diction ("heirloom seed saver," "vortex inheritance," "furious tranquility"). However, perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices abstractions (vortex, entropy, texture) rather than filtering them through character-specific bias or professional idiom. The prose modulates little under pressure; stakes rise in exposition ("the choice was clear") but not through syntax or sensory narrowing. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric texture ("prayer frozen mid-breath," "curiosity, that other compass"), though several phrases edge toward purple prose without serving peak pressure. POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, with free indirect access to Elara's reasoning. However, perceptual signature is weak—her "way of noticing" does not shift distinctively under stress, and the prose maintains the same elevated register throughout. The repeated descriptor "credibly curious" and the phrase "windblown sanctuary" recur without evolution, reading as template anchors. No dialogue is present, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction aims for elevated lyricism ("silken shroud," "primal elegance"). However, register drifts into generic inspirational prose ("vulnerability is not weakness, but the very force that allows light to pierce darkness") that lacks character-specific texture. Perceptual signature is weak—Sola's noticing feels authored rather than selective. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is controlled but uniform, relying on similar lyric cadences throughout without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. However, diction recycles template phrases across the text: "tranquilly perceptive" appears verbatim four times, "mute eloquence" three times, "tangled covenant" six times, "weight of unspoken words" five times. This label-churn flattens the narrative voice into a committee consensus rather than a singular perceptual signature. Under peak moments (ghost dissolving, vow sealing), syntax does not compress or shift—rhythm remains uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("corroded jewel," "ink in water," "voice like pages turning"). However, elevated metaphor saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "timeless," "eternal hum," "grammar of numbers" all arrive in quick succession, flattening urgency. The figure's exposition ("He knew the Recalibration was coming…") shifts into flat summary rather than embodied voice. Elara's perceptual signature (cataloguing damaged capsules) is established early but does not modulate under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited holds without head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("harmonizing discord," "burnished hush," "woven dawns") that clashes with embodied perception. Psychic distance remains static—no modulation under pressure. Repetitive sentence stems plague the text: "He [verb]" opens 18 paragraphs, and "The [noun]" opens seven more, creating template cadence across the entire piece. Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perceptions. The prose carries a distinct, measured texture—"weathered calm," "gently systematic," "brazen calm"—that mirrors the protagonist's stance. However, these signature phrases recur as labels rather than evolving through embodied perception, creating a template cadence. The diary excerpts and the orchard's whispered words ("patience, gratitude, continue") blur the line between Elias's voice and authorial design. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is moot. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the final shift to the new caretaker's POV is clearly marked by a section break, though it risks diluting the closure's immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic; the narration could describe almost any patient craftsman.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent perceptual signature: the protagonist notices chemical traces, resonance, molecular blueprints. The diction ("luminous skeptic," "quiet forge of bronze resolve") is elevated and consistent, though it borders on ornamental in high-pressure beats. The narrative voice avoids head-hopping and maintains distance control. No dialogue appears. The rhythm modulates appropriately, slowing for reflection and tightening during the climb and data analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric-mythic register ("gloom-hill coachman," "narrow vastness," "ghost of the reef"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; the narration filters perception through the coachman's knowledge of languages and birds without head-hopping. No dialogue appears. The prose maintains its texture under pressure, though the final summary paragraphs compress weeks without modulating rhythm or showing perceptual degradation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with bloodhound-specific perception (parsing frequencies "like reading Braille with his eardrums," scent memory navigation). Diction remains grounded in canine interiority without anthropomorphic overreach. The prose modulates effectively from settlement détente to trek urgency to vault intimacy. Kess and the archivist exchange is brief but distinct (raccoon pragmatism vs. Wick's driven focus). Minor slip: "intuitively descriptive" and "translating pressure waves into syntax" drift slightly into analytical register for a dog's lived experience, though the metaphor recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with elevated diction ("blessed pariah," "cruel stretch of time") that fits the solitary, reflective stance. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, the prose occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction that dulls immediacy ("the echo of the deck's silence following me like a shadow"). Perceptual signature is stargazer-specific but lacks the bias or blind spots that would reveal internal contradiction. The final paragraph's register ("blessed pariah in a gilded compass rose") is awkward—one cannot be "in" an appliqué—suggesting a minor syntactic slip under the lyric mode's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narrative voice is stable third-person limited, with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacredly playful art," "cathedral of glass," "spiraling shaft of frozen starlight") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Kaelen's perceptual signature is generic; no idiosyncratic bias shapes what he notices or ignores. Reflection and interiority lean on label-speak ("cautious abandon," "chivalrous thief turned guardian") rather than sentence-level rhythm or compression that would reflect his mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with purpose-driven figurative language ("ghost who had learned to cast a shadow"). POV distance is stable and Kael's perceptual signature (poetic, memorial) is maintained. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence") that feels concept-driven rather than character-specific. The prisoner has no distinct voice or interior access, which is acceptable for single-POV, but his few quoted words carry no subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (mercury-glass metaphor, "every glance...spilled a silvery memory that burned") establishes voice. Diction is elevated and consistent ("geometry of belonging," "ghostly shimmer") but leans toward ornamental lyricism that abstracts rather than sharpening under pressure. Key beats rely on passive constructions and filter verbs: "the light poured into her mind," "she realized that the mountain bookstore itself was a living map." No dialogue. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but does not degrade under stress—syntax remains decoratively uniform rather than compressing or fragmenting at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The tutor's perceptual signature—chess-trained fingers, reading threads as "cryptic notation"—is legible. Diction elevates at times ("fierce repose," "woven hush," "temporal stasis") in ways that feel ornamental rather than voice-rooted. The girl's single line of dialogue is brief and functional. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose occasionally drifts into essay register ("forgiveness was not a single act") that undercuts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; distance is consistent and psychic access clear. Diction ("forged hush," "calcium-white monoliths") is elevated but voice-coherent. Two weak points: the phrase "innocently mischievous" recurs as label without behavioral texture, and register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("forgiveness without understanding was merely forgetting dressed in sacred robes") that reads more authorial than character-rooted. Mara's dialogue carries subtext but her internal voice is underwritten, flattening the secondary presence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Elara's perceptual signature—alchemist's precision, mapping procedures vocally—is consistent. However, the prose frequently shifts into elevated, poetic register ("dire enchantment," "threadbare map," "embroidered that truth") that reads more authorial than character-filtered, especially under hypoxic stress when diction should compress. The narration of her procedure ("Scarab aligns with crater seven, left temple, fracture pattern delta") anchors the voice in technical discipline, but phrases like "conjuring meaning from absence, the alchemist's last true transmutation" sound like thematic annotation rather than her lived thought. Under peak pressure (final breath, inhaling poison), the rhythm maintains lyricism when urgency might strip language bare.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature (painter's eye for light, color, shadow) is consistent. Diction is mostly clean, though phrases like "intimately aloof" and "temporary eternity" repeat as thematic labels rather than lived perception. The final two paragraphs slip into summary voice ("He would paint again, but now his brush moved with a lighter heart") that tells emotional resolution rather than showing it through action or image. No head-hopping, but distance control loosens at closure when it should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Elara's perceptual signature: she reads Marcus's intent "beneath the noise" and recalls her mother's garden with olfactory precision. Psychic distance tightens at the climax when the narrative zooms into Marcus's chest and his forgotten feeling, a brief but clean slip that serves the emotional beat. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("cobalt glass...sang when struck," "screaming tenderness"). One slip: "the way scent carried intention better than voice ever could" edges into thesis statement mid-reflection rather than anchored observation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Kael's grief and determination. Diction is elevated and lyric ("black tide lapping," "mosaic of cold light"), appropriate for the voice. However, several lines drift into abstraction or stock phrasing: "raw solace," "tears carved rivers," "fragile peace" feel generic rather than character-particular. The midnight caller's refrain ("Follow the foot, trace the glow, bring them home") is evocative but borders on over-stylized. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter holds, but the voice occasionally smooths into aesthetic posture rather than urgent interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is distinct and lyric ("each sentence a splinter I could not swallow") with controlled register in descriptive passages. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("I knew I had to occlude," "I realized that the eye was not a curse"), and the narrator's diction occasionally drifts into workshop idiom ("cultivate psychological safety," "fragile, shared safety") that sits outside the truffle-forager's established lexicon. POV remains stable (single first-person throughout) with no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. The final paragraphs shift into summary mode ("In the days that followed, I learned…") which lowers immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (lantern swinging, focus on gaps, whispered name) is consistent. The phrase "softly persistent" recurs purposefully as a textural anchor. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vestige of light dissolved," "borrowed memory settle gently") that feels more authorial than lighthouse-keeper particular, and the final paragraphs' retrospective summary ("From that day forward... would often pace") shifts out of present-scene focalization into distant narration without dramatized cost, flattening immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Merrick sees patterns in ink, age, and now entomology. The prose carries a distinct texture—"ghosting," "pipe smoke," "river of formicans"—that suits an antiquarian's mind. Filter verbs ("seemed to say," "could almost read") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Elision is minimal and purposeful. No head-hopping. The phrase "empirically intuitive to the last" at closure reads slightly explanatory but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("velvet cloak catching on thorns," "mineral water that caught the bleeding starlight"), appropriate to a disenchanted queen's perspective. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing during peak beats ("not the bitter resignation of a crown, but the quiet devotion of a keeper") without embodied grounding. No head-hopping, but the mountain's voice at closure shifts narrative authority without clear filter, creating minor focalization blur.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice defaults to elevated, abstract register ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity," "palette of resolve") that remains constant regardless of pressure. Dialogue is indistinguishable between characters—both speak in the same quasi-mystical idiom ("By letting the past fold into the present like ink into water"). POV distance is stable but the perceptual signature is generic: no character-particular way of noticing or filtering detail. Filter verbs and summary interiority ("she felt," "she understood") flatten immediacy throughout, and the final paragraph slips into thesis statement rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinctive—hyperliterate, poetic, steeped in dream logic—and maintains coherent psychic distance throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: the chronicler notices in metaphor ("wind howled through chinks like a bored oracle," "stars rearranged themselves into constellations I'd named in dreams"). No dialogue to evaluate. However, elevated diction ("preemptive grief," "harmonic," "lucid truth") occasionally drifts above the embodied present, especially under peak stress where compression might serve better. Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. The voice modulates with intensity but leans heavily on lyric register, risking distance from immediate pressure in climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with Elena's perceptual filter (metallic taste, topography of screw, fog as watercolor wash), and her selective attention reflects an aromatherapist's trained focus redirected. Marcus's dialogue carries subtext (clock as translator, birthing metaphor) without exposition. However, elevated philosophical register ("humanize our losses by giving them form," "trembling calm of morning") occasionally exceeds Elena's crisis-state idiom, and Marcus's perfect insights at peak moments flatten into wisdom-dispenser voice rather than a peer under his own pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelin; psychic distance is consistent and diction ("crow spirit," "youthful superstitions") fits her scholarly voice. Perceptual signature is selective (focus on ink, quill, crystals) and voice-motivated. However, some filter-verb stacks ("She felt," "She imagined," "She thought") and repetitive sentence stems ("She whispered," "She tucked," "She remembered") compress texture under pressure. No head-hopping or tense drift, and the reflective mode anchors in present ritual, but rhythmic variety could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored in Mira's perceptions. However, the voice oscillates between grounded column-writer idiom and elevated lyric register ("a sensory bridge spanning years of silence," "ethereal grit"). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful but stylized to the point of artificiality: "A broken chord still vibrates if you listen in the right silence" and "The orchard's final hush is like the fermata" feel crafted for the reader rather than spoken under emotional pressure. Mira's perceptual signature—gossip columnist, exorcism metaphors—is present but not consistently embodied in syntax or diction; her interiority often defaults to poetic narration rather than character-specific thought patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited with elevated diction ("wanderingly exact," "entropy's yawn") that fits the cosmic-temple register. Perceptual signature exists but leans abstract: "definitions bleeding at edges" and "false narratives pressed against her skin like moths" are vivid yet generic to any mystical observer rather than character-particular. The whispered phrase "Journeying inward while walking out" reads as thematic device rather than the witness's own idiom. Psychic distance holds, but the prose feels authored for effect rather than emerging from her specific consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific; diction ("eminently peculiar," "the space between being and not being") tilts abstract-philosophical without embodied texture. Sentence stems recur ("He counted," "Elias squinted," "The razor edges") creating mild template cadence. Voice lacks distinct rhythm or lexical fingerprint; the prose could belong to any meditative narrator. No purposeful distance shift or strong idiom emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person POV, cleanly filtered through Lila's academic lens. Diction matches her training ("hidden Markov chain," "gambler's fallacy") and stays consistent. Perceptual signature is present (noticing ratios, patterns). However, elevated register pervades even emotional beats ("theoretically rebellious act," "lucid contradiction," "clover-melancholy"), reducing embodied texture under pressure. Reflection dominates the middle third without micro-choices that alter present tactics, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("glass harmonica disc spinning silently," "thorny hedge," "fragile thread of connection") that stays character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "wondered") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the disc-touch, wider during tunnel walk). Minor slips: "The story, like the tunnel, ran deep" intrudes as meta-commentary in the final third, and some syntactic stems repeat ("She had," "Mira's," "The phone").

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through the archivist's preservationist lens. Diction is elevated and lyric ("salt-kissed twilight air," "ghostly echoes") with a consistent texture, though register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("proximate cause," "context"). Perceptual signature is present: she notices ink, paper, scent, weight. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and tense remains consistent. Brief compression at peak moments (climb, writing, offering) fits voice and does not obscure clarity. Purposeful lyric elevation supports the accumulative design without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and the prose carries a faint lyric texture ("sleep beneath a blanket of ivy," "polite anarchy"). Dialogue is absent, so subtext cannot be evaluated. Psychic distance remains consistent, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("harmonious resonance of shared loneliness") rather than sharpening through the focalizer's lens. No perceptual signature distinguishes this narrator's way of noticing from generic literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third; distance is consistent and Elara's perceptual signature (tactile, sonic) is distinctive. Diction occasionally inflates into elevated register ("dialect of unspoken grief and love," "hinge of night") that sits uneasily beside concrete sensory moves. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (repeated "language," "quiet blaze") are taught early, though by the final third the recurrence begins to feel templated rather than charged. Focalization remains tight; no head-hopping or withheld knowledge that the POV already possesses.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct syntactic rhythm and vocabulary ("ozone and old regret," "thresh meaning from the chaff"). POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and perceptual filters are character-specific (signal interpreter tuned to cosmic noise). However, the voice uniformly elevates across emotional beats without modulation; peak moments ("he smiled at the thought") match the same register as exposition. The final third recycles stems ("strange comfort" appears four times in close succession, "He wondered," "He decided") and several paragraphs paraphrase the same thematic stance without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices absences, the camera's cracked leather, the moon's pressure on water. Diction is lyric and elevated ("the between-places where mist and memory blurred") but voice-motivated for this contemplative, ghostly narrator. The advisor's silence and sign language are handled cleanly without head-hopping; her interiority is accessed only through visible gesture. One friction: some phrasing leans ornamental ("charisma not a performance but a gravity") where a more concrete action would sharpen the image. Psychic distance holds steady; no filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leakage. The prose carries a distinct texture that modulates subtly as Elias's emotional state shifts from stasis to engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, and diction ("deep层 archive" intrusion aside) remains consistent with Kael's analytical yet emotionally charged perspective. The prose modulates well between catalogue detail (star maps, botanical studies) and lyric intensity ("volcanic tenderness," "breath thick with forgotten stories"). Two slips: "deep层" is untranslated code-switch without context, and the narration occasionally drifts into convenient omniscience (e.g., knowing the tapestry was slashed "with deliberate hatred" when Kael can only infer motive from artifact).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear psychic distance; Kael's perceptual signature (translating memory as percussion, noticing resonance frequencies) is character-specific. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the sci-fi elegy mode, but some lines veer into ornamental register ("auroral sorrow," "the hush of the universe inhaling") without varying under peak stress. No dialogue present to evaluate. The phrase "at the hush of the universe inhaling" recurs as a structural anchor but feels more poetic convenience than earned POV idiom. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and focalized through Marek's expertise. Vocabulary is controlled and voice-specific ("corrugated," "acoustic architecture," "ghost walks"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You're the one who says whispers carry further than screams"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately with tension, and perceptual signature (identifying walks, hearing vibrations) is consistent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV with poetic diction holds a consistent register ("spiralingly calm," "weave light"), but the narrative voice feels more like external narration than the guardian's or child's perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable, yet the piece offers no interior access to the guardian's wants or contradictions, and the child's interiority is summarized ("unspoken fears," "quiet awe"). The single line of dialogue (line 28) carries naturalism, but surrounded by lyric abstraction it cannot distinguish voice. Sentence rhythm varies, but many stems repeat ("The child…," "The guardian…," "The dental mirror…") without cumulative charge.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    Third-person limited holds to Hartwin's perspective without head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (hearing unspoken fears, noticing cobalt shadows) attempts character-specific texture. However, diction drifts into abstraction at key beats: "forests of second thoughts," "hush where past meets prophecy," "magnetic pull of shared uncertainty." The final whisper ("Even the smallest piece can dream of becoming a queen") shifts into didactic register that breaks the established voice. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—each paragraph maintains the same meditative pace regardless of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close ("felt the island's pulse match her own heartbeat") and lyric remove ("a dancer's grace"). Perceptual signature leans poetic and dance-inflected ("body a silhouette," "arms tracing arcs"), though it occasionally slips into elevated register that doesn't feel earned by a dock worker's lexicon ("sublittoral fringe" is narratorial, not Mira's idiom). No dialogue is present. Prose rhythm supports the lyric-accumulative mode, but some figurative language feels decorative rather than voice-motivated. Internal thought formatting is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("phantom limbs of a forgotten world," "brittle as the promises"). Perceptual filtering is consistent: the performer notices turbines, shavings, petals. No head-hopping or POV leakage. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract literariness ("emotional void," "fleeting lightness") that sits slightly outside the performer's lived experience under pressure, and the final paragraphs shift toward explanatory summary rather than maintaining the performer's immediate perceptual lens through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person close with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and texture is purposeful ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow," "spine of frozen music"), establishing a lyric register. However, perceptual signature is generic—any aesthetically driven poet could narrate these observations. Register drift into abstraction ("tremor of certainty," "boundary between self and world") flattens immediacy in peak beats. Sentence structures repeat template cadences ("She realized," "She felt," "She whispered") across multiple paragraphs without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is generic (morning light, molten glass swirls, silver stones) without character-specific filtering. Register drifts into lyric/abstract ("a tapestry of grey and silver," "a language of flawed grace") that does not match Elara's trade-focused goal. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is unstable—Elara's interior is summarized while Dorian's is asserted ("felt a stirring") without access.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third around Kaelen; perceptual signature is present in her focus on acoustic detail and light refraction. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "the grain of wooden pews worn smooth by desperate prayer" and "the space between them, textured and golden and impossibly alive" feel more like authored prose than Kaelen's urgent thought under pressure. Dialogue with Mara is purposeful and goal-driven ("What if the 0.3% isn't error, but the entire point?"), yet both characters' speech shares a similar philosophical cadence. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("After the power grid stabilized, people wanted certainty") reads as narrator intrusion rather than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but psychic distance drifts between immediate perception and omniscient summary ("For three eternities," "The observatory remained timeless"). Perceptual signature is generic—elevated metaphoric diction dominates without character-specific bias in noticing. The woman's dialogue ("You taught my dying star to bloom," "voice like curtains closing and opening") reads as thematic echo rather than goal-driven speech. Diction stays in a narrow lyric register that does not modulate meaningfully under pressure, and the prose lacks the specificities of a lived-in mind.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close access to Mara's professional stance. However, voice distinctness is weak—Mara's interior diction ("sacred geometry of greed," "topographical map of human choice") reads elevated and abstract rather than character-particular, especially during a ritual she performs routinely. The architect's silent interiority is briefly accessed ("realized it was a mirror") without clean focalization cues. Dialogue is minimal but functional; "Your mistake was believing in single chains of truth" carries the thematic load directly. Perceptual signature is generic high-literary rather than Mara-specific, and filter verbs ("watched it pool," "studied the pattern") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("latent energy," "fragile epoch," "mosaic of joy and grief") that reads generic rather than Lyra-specific. Perceptual signature is weak: her way of noticing (historian, scholar, mourner?) is never character-particular. The phrase "steadily unpredictable" appears three times with identical phrasing, creating template cadence. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") cluster in the final third without voice motivation, dulling immediacy at closure (−0.5 in Q7 spillover, noted here for distance control).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (notices shadows, dusk, subtle movements), though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("luminous regret," "the delicate shape of hope") that feels slightly removed from lived interiority. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, reflective constructions early, shorter decisive beats at the stone-placement climax. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but some filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew," "she wondered") appear where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose voice is distinct but borders on uniform lyricism without enough variation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization on Elara; perceptual signature is wildlife-handler specific (she reads Veridian's color shifts, gauges gecko injuries). Diction remains character-bound and modulates under pressure (short clauses when she hears the car). No head-hopping. Minor slip: "shimmering stillness" and "liquid silver" in the opening paragraph push briefly toward elevated lyricism that feels slightly imposed rather than fully Elara's idiom, but the voice settles into her professional register and holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable without head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between concrete detail ("cool water lapping at her fingers") and elevated register ("the meteor hush she felt was the calm before a great reckoning") that exceeds naturalistic interiority. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric texture, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Elara notices in poeticized generalities rather than through a distinct filtering lens shaped by her wound-opening habit.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-close with a distinct lyric texture—"celluloid ghosts," "neutron star matter," "hushed thunder"—that matches the archival, incantatory subject. Diction is elevated but consistent, though "spatially imaginative" and "psychometry reading" repeat as labels without fully inhabiting Mira's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "understood") cluster in the revelation sequence, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present; interior voice is coherent but leans abstract under pressure rather than fragmenting or sharpening with stress.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but generic, relying on stock poetic constructions ("silken shadows," "whispered secrets," "luminous scar") that could fit any mystical-journey template. Distance is stable third-limited but offers no perceptual signature—the protagonist's way of noticing is indistinguishable from the narrator's tour-guide descriptions. Psychic distance never modulates; the prose maintains the same elevated register in crisis ("let the silence enfold her") and resolution ("each line a meteor's streak"). No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with a distinct lyric-metaphysical texture: "probability cloud stretched across the waste," "wave functions干涉ed" (note the non-English verb intrusion, likely a generation artifact). Psychic distance is consistent, though the elevated register and abstract diction occasionally drift from embodied perception—"cancer of nothing eating possibility" reads more authorial than character-grounded. The narrative voice is purposeful and atmospheric, but the reliance on concept-language ("might-be into is," "quantum foam") flattens urgency in peak beats. No dialogue to assess. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains it, but some constructions ("干涉ed") break legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual signature (everything filtered through the philosopher's contemplative lens). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: elevated, lyric, philosophical register throughout. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (anaphora, parallel constructions) are taught early and sustained. However, psychic distance never modulates with pressure—the same meditative tone persists regardless of stakes, missing opportunities for rhythmic variation that would track emotional urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual filter (fog, twilight, lantern glow) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("threshold," "persistence of their steps," "talisman of courage") that abstracts rather than grounds. The ferry guides' dialogue ("Sometimes the courage we haven't used is the brightest star we carry") reads as authorial wisdom rather than character-specific speech. Free indirect style is clean but lacks distinct rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (nerve sensation, sign-language habits, "divine purpose when viewed through the lens of service") is distinct and character-specific. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the rust-stain discovery and the descent to report. Diction remains controlled ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence") without register drift. No dialogue on the page; the precentor's nod and gesture serve as silent exchange consistent with the silent-choir setting. Compression of thought ("She stopped. She could report. She should report.") reads purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Sylvar, with brief access to Vael's gleaming eyes and gasping lips. Diction is elevated and ornate throughout ("a quiet symphony of ink and paper," "the slow lung of eternity"), creating a consistent texture but minimal perceptual signature—Sylvar's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. The prose does not modulate under pressure; metaphor density remains constant from opening to closure, and Sylvar's internal voice lacks distinct idiom or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV, third limited, with stable perceptual signature (witness vocabulary, pattern-seeking, tactile engagement with objects). Psychic distance is controlled; Lina's interiority is specific ("silent scream," "the deep," "the rhythm of a world reborn"). Minor diction drift: "periodically eternal" appears in narration as concept rather than Lina's own idiom, reading slightly imposed. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain consistent. Voice is competent and purpose-driven, though not maximally distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kai; perceptual signature is consistent (stargazer mind seeing patterns, frequencies over tactics). Diction carries purposeful compression ("margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity") and lyric density that fits the accumulative mode. Some register drift occurs: "reigniting the beacon's pulse with each note" and "defiant meaning" lean slightly elevated for the focalizer's idiom under stress. Free indirect style is clean, though one brief venture into collective rebel/occupier reactions ("frowned at the inexplicable signal") widens the lens without full POV break.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Mara's perspective with stable distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a folkloric register ("Chamber of Resin," "Covenant of Amber") that fits the setting. However, perceptual signature is generic – "her gnarled fingers," "clear-eyed intent" – and lacks character-particular idiom. Filter verbs ("feeling the water's heat climb") and expository interiority ("This is what we're meant to protect") dull immediacy at key beats. Dialogue is sparse and functional but unremarkable; Mara's speech to her grandson could belong to any wise elder. Psychic distance widens during peak moments (unsealing, seed retrieval) when tighter focalization would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices grooves, pressure, paths (forensic architect's eye repurposed). Diction matches his interior idiom ("somatic marker activated," "anchored in nerve endings") without register drift. The curator's dialogue ("The body remembers what the mind cannot bear to hold") fits her soil-under-nails authority. Filter verbs ("feeling," "realized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the conservatory sequence (hours of sketching summarized) serves momentum. The final paragraph's metaphor stack (body as tower, markers as beam, pearl as lens) is dense but legible, teaching the pattern through parallel structure. POV modesty holds—Elias infers but does not claim omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("velvet fingers," "pivot point," "mortar weeping salt"), consistent with an artist's interior but approaching ornamental density in high-pressure beats (thread-touching sequence). Perceptual signature is present (paint-stained, brush-weight metaphors). The rhetorical-question loops ("did truth matter," "was she saving or sentencing") establish voice but also create a repetitive syntactic tic. Filter verbs are sparse. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (walls closing), the prose remains lush rather than compressing, which slightly undercuts urgency but reads as intentional voice choice rather than control slip.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction such as "molasses slow" and "silent pulse" carries texture, and the narration filters perception through Kael's heightened senses. However, the prose leans heavily on compound-adjective constructions ("wind carved," "consciously wild") and label phrases ("serene anger," "calm anger," "quiet fury," "conscious wildness") that repeat without embodied differentiation. The voice feels constructed rather than character-particular, especially in peak beats where the metaphors ("blade," "forge," "shaping the ephemeral") elevate diction beyond the tracker's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric-archival texture ("breath fogged," "dizzying quiet," "nitrogen haze"). Perceptual signature is present in Elara's attention to schematics and server racks. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgent choice: "gestating something loud and alive," "blade and wound," "the static of possibility." The phrase "bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label rather than embodied perception. Filter verbs ("She wondered," "She had expected") flatten immediacy in high-pressure beats without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct with lyric texture ("petals thick like parchment," "perfume a quiet fire") and the prose modulates with scene pressure (shorter syntax during the storm). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-filtered ("inculcating plants with values," "fractured mosaic"). Free indirect style is mostly clean. The deserter's interiority is read through observation, which maintains distance appropriately. Rhythmic control is evident but some figurative density ("quiet fire" appears twice) feels recycled.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Avery; distance is consistent. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("fisher of echoes," "voicing silence," "smoke made of midnight and milk") that coheres as intentional stylization. However, the same elevated constructions repeat mechanically across beats—"transliterated," "voiced through silence," "zigzag"—creating template cadence rather than modulating with pressure. Dialogue (Echo's single question and Avery's silent answer) is purposeful but minimal. The perceptual signature (cool-headed fisher) is asserted more than shown through varied observation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Victoria with a distinct perceptual signature: astronomical metaphors, journalistic observation, father's editorial ruthlessness internalized. The voice maintains consistent diction and psychic distance. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("solemn playfulness of it," "ironical precision") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-bound under pressure. The rosewood nib description and proof-by-contradiction interiority carry voice-specific texture. No dialogue present; monologue in the counter-memo reads purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, stable distance, consistent past tense. Perceptual signature is controlled: Elara's lens filters through constellation tattooist idiom ("celestial ink," "star-pattern," "tether"). Diction remains elevated and voice-consistent ("dark membrane," "golden weight," "cold absolution"). However, the prose occasionally slips into explanatory register without urgency: "She understood now that the haunted firmware wasn't malfunctioning; it was grieving." Filter verbs ("could translate," "could hear") stack in expository lines. No head-hopping. The piece maintains a lyric, incantatory rhythm, though some lines ("Each word was a small death") flatten into abstraction during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("socially perceptive as any diplomat's," "emergent hush crystallized into pure silence") that clashes with embodied urgency at peak beats. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: the artist notices symbolic objects (tile flake, mandala) but her way of seeing lacks character-specific bias. Voice modulation is minimal—tone remains uniformly lyrical and declarative without rhythmic shift under pressure. Free indirect access is clean but delivers exposition ("Her motivation had never been mere curiosity") rather than live thought.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a lyric register throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy") but risks convergence with the narrative voice—Arin's interior reads like the prose frame rather than character-particular thought. Perceptual signature is weak; sensory details (ash, sky, stone) feel uniform rather than filtered through a distinct mind. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (fire, steel, warmth/cold) are present but the repetition trends toward mantra rather than taught pattern with payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to the ghost is maintained throughout with no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, leaning lyric/elevated ("synesthetic shimmer," "luminous path," "tapestry of colors"), and the diction matches the ghostly, theatrical milieu. Psychic distance is stable. However, the prose sometimes drifts into explanatory mode ("He knew that the timeline had splintered," "She would never know the ghost's name") that flattens immediacy. Free indirect style is clean when present. No dialogue on the page, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature (sound-to-color) is declared but not deeply inhabited through micro-choices or stress-driven shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV third-limited is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (studio artist's eye, geode appreciation) but diction drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "resonant reconfiguration," "somatic marker") that feels imported rather than voice-native under the established sensory focus. Psychic distance is consistent. The final paragraphs repeat syntactic stems ("She [verb]," "The studio's [noun]") and recycle phrases ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "hidden pathways") without variation, creating template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature that filters the cave through metaphor ("repository of transitional objects," "colours bled into one another"). Diction remains stable and apt for the contemplative mode. However, the prose occasionally tips into expository interiority ("Lira realized that these caves were more than stone") that tells rather than trusts the image, and the final paragraphs lean on summary ("she would offer them the map") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a distinct lyric texture—"time pooled like resin," "phonetic shards that rattled"—and the compression and patterned diction feel purposeful for an accumulative design. POV remains stable in third-person limited with no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("syntax of possibility itself," "raw possibility") that feels more prompt-aligned than character-particular, and the perceptual signature does not shift under pressure; the turner's way of noticing remains consistent and calm even at the climactic assembly. Psychic distance stays controlled, and no dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering setting and memory through Kael's operative perspective (e.g., "dead drop protocol," "safehouse coordinates"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the exchange and opening slightly for the reflective beats. The dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("You brought what was promised?"), carrying subtext in the courier's economy. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully motivated by an ex-operative's voice: "vouchsafe," "prudently daring," "silver hush" in narration feel imposed rather than organic to Kael's idiom under stress. The perceptual signature is present (the pillbox's worn initials, the courier's breath ghosting) but not deeply idiosyncratic. No head-hopping; tense and stance are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchored in Silas is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during waiting, slightly wider during the crossing). Diction is elevated and consistent ("ambient awareness," "palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity"), but the register occasionally drifts into philosophical abstraction ("distillation they had both pursued," "architecture of the girl he remembered") that risks voice uniformity. The two brief dialogue lines carry subtext and avoid exposition. Perceptual signature is strong: Silas notices through coachman's expertise (reins, wheels, vibration). Filter verbs ("he felt," "he perceived") appear but are voice-motivated. Minor slip: the woman's interior is opaque, so we cannot assess voice distinction beyond her single line. The prose reads as a singular, lyric narrator rather than distinct character voices.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kai notices through a potter's lens (clay settling, glazes, wheel rhythm). Voice is purposeful and imagistic, with occasional compression ("phototropic to kindness") that fits the lyric-meditative register. No head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately—tighter during wheel work, wider during reflection. Some diction edges toward elevated register ("temporal overlap," "bent time around itself") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Elision is taught and paid off; the piece sustains its textural coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya, and perceptual signature is present (locksmith's precision, machine oil memory, measured soil cuts). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some register drift occurs: "wistfully pragmatic devotion," "translating it, turning grief into geometry," "protected vulnerability" read as elevated summary rather than Maya's lived idiom under pressure. The recurring phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" is purposeful but borders on over-crafted lyricism that distances rather than deepens immediacy. No dialogue is present; the piece maintains coherent distance and internal texture, though emotional peaks sometimes compress into abstraction rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the speculative-mythic frame. However, perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "brittle awakening," "resilient truth," and "weaver of time" could apply to any contemplative protagonist. Syntactic patterns repeat (she + verb constructions) without purposeful variation. Voice texture is present but not character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present in the whimsical lens ("watercolor dream," "prismatic quiet"). Diction stays elevated and lyric throughout, which supports tone but flattens pressure—no rhythmic or lexical tightening occurs under stress. The phrase "prismatic quiet" recurs as a motif but risks becoming a label. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (astronomical charts as star map of suspicion, ozone and vinyl sensory anchors) is character-specific and consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("infra-linguistic commands," "ethereal grit") that feels imposed rather than Mara's lived idiom, especially under peak stress. Dr. Chen's brief dialogue ("demanding answers") is functional but generic. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during discovery, wider during summary exposition), and the compression during the climax ("flipped the switch") matches urgency without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction stays elevated throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's noticing does not feel character-specific, and the prose converges on a uniform lyric register ("prismatic desire," "wistful rebellion," "sonic tempest") that reads more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance remains fixed; no modulation under stress. The elevated diction ("malevolent will," "spatial mutiny") clashes with practical explorer interiority. No dialogue to assess. Stable execution but lacks the voice particularity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature (geometries of grief, ratios of loss) is distinct. Register control is strong in the opening and studio sections. However, the final paragraphs drift into elevated abstraction ("the furrowed hush had lifted, replaced by something quieter") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. Diction remains within plausible lexicon and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited to the librarian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices maps, coordinates, atmospheric data, and the journals' coded language. Voice modulates appropriately from anxious cataloging to defiant certainty. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("fractured jet stream," "reversible exile," "crystalline purpose") that fits a scholarly map librarian. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Look at what she found for us... Look at what we've been erasing"), carrying subtext of vindication and challenge. Minor slips: repeated phrase stems ("nervously confident" appears three times) and filter-stack in one passage ("she understood," "she knew," "she would catalogue") slightly dull immediacy, though the clustering does not pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with no head-hopping. The prose establishes a consistent lyric-metaphysical register ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty," "dynamically observant") that is voice-motivated and legible, though at times it drifts toward abstraction that obscures immediate perception. Perceptual signature is present but generic for the archetype (mystic musician); diction occasionally inflates ("recount the tale, turning the scaffold's secret into a melody") where plain narration would sharpen momentum. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-close on the son; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("polished calm," "dusky harmony") that matches the reflective stance. Dialogue is sparse: the son's single metaphor and Leo's whispered reply feel purpose-built rather than natural speech. Filter verbs ("believed," "thought," "understood") stack in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is generic—"traced the rust patterns"—without character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated abstractions ("phonetic amber," "vigil," "syllables of solace") that strain the POV's internal texture during high-pressure moments. The line "healing with words was not a gift but a responsibility passed down" reads as thematic summary rather than lived perception. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she understood") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third limited; distance is stable. Diction ("guarded," "warlike serenity," "ravenous hunger") is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into stock fantasy register ("maelstrom of dead fruit and rot"). Perceptual signature reflects the druid's magical focus (silver light circles, ice groaning, curse tasting of bitter betrayal). No dialogue present. Some filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood") dull immediacy at peak beats. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, tightening during the chant sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register with purposeful compression and patterned lyricism ("root-bound visionary," "dreamstuff leaking through the seams of reality"), and the perceptual signature—metaphor-dense, attuned to light and texture—feels character-particular. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that blurs immediacy: "the future press against her ribs" and "anxious elation fluttered in her throat" rely on conceptual constructs rather than concrete sensation. The ancestor-figure's dialogue ("You've come to renew what was broken") carries functional subtext but reads slightly formal for a voice composed of "rustling leaves." No head-hopping or POV leakage; distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a heightened register ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle," "inlaying meaning everywhere") that reads as intentional voice. However, the repeated phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" (used six times) and the stock metaphors ("conviction and borrowed time," "hole she left behind") create a template cadence that flattens immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the Keeper's "voice like rustling leaves over stone" fits the setting. The narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge, with no head-hopping, but the perceptual signature is not character-particular—adjectives like "dusky" and "fiercely gentle" feel imposed rather than arising from Elara's internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent—Mara filters experience through appraisal language and musical memory. Diction is controlled, with "confidently uncertain" and "wrest" folded into the flow without artifice. Dale's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. The prose modulates between reflection and present action without head-hopping. Minor slip: the phrase "a tangible note of her own encore" edges toward authorial gloss rather than Mara's interior idiom, but the lapse is brief and does not derail distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to Elara's interiority. Diction is elevated and controlled—"wedge-shaped signs," "analogical resonance," "translucent root"—fitting a scholarly translator's perception. The narrative voice modulates appropriately, tightening during the carving sequence and opening into reflection at closure. Minor slips: "Her ambition haunted her" and "haunted ambition resolved" are repeated phrase stems that flatten momentum. The perceptual signature is present (she thinks through analogy, compares magnetic attraction to gravity of memory) but could be more idiosyncratic; the voice occasionally drifts toward committee consensus in lines like "understanding that transition has no moment, only a field of proximity."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Elara's sensors and brass-filtered perception. Perceptual signature is consistent: "brass gears within her chest," "mechanical vision recording," "titan-gear librarian walked on." Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (close during the crucible choice, slightly elevated during tidal rounds). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("temporal lacuna," "annular furnace," "metabolism instead of cremation") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic, particularly during high-pressure moments. The repeated sentence stems ("The creel remained," "Let them") and participial openers create mild template cadence in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("cathedral arches, refracting her single beam into a thousand spectral promises") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is professional-technical (dosimeter, structural scan) layered with lyric compression. However, the final paragraph shifts into essayistic summary ("she had discovered what holds them together"), diluting the narrative stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Mira's perceptual signature (hyper-sensitivity post-medication) colors the narration. However, psychic distance wobbles: "she felt the weight" and "she realized" filter heavily, and some metaphors ("red circles like wounds," "river itself was washing her clean") drift toward elevated register. The voice is consistent but not fully character-particular, and the final paragraphs shift into a more lyric, distanced summary.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric register. Vocabulary is controlled and atmospheric ("whispered secrets," "forgotten memory"). However, the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; the dreamer notices what the prose needs rather than what her goals and flaws would select. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized," "She knew") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lira with distinct sensory filtering (telepathic plant whispers, coffee-stain divination). The prose carries a lyric, slightly elevated register that fits the velvet-observatory setting but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing: "the mulberry ache of a decision," "promise that had once glowed like a dewdrop on a spider's web." The envoy's dialogue is summarized rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity for subtext and voice distinction. Purposeful compression is evident but at peak beats—the refusal and the planting—the narrative summarizes rather than dramatizing, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout; POV filters all perception through Elara's professional lens (frequencies, sigils, surgical extraction). Diction is elevated and consistent ("smoldering with unspoken verse," "waveform," "photons"), apt for the lyric-technical voice. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct (light as Morse code, stillness as lens). However, register occasionally tips into abstract lyricism ("threshold of stillness," "borrowed brilliance") that risks opacity under pressure, and some figurative choices ("green mouth drinking starlight") feel ornamental rather than voice-essential.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance controlled and Elara's perceptual signature clear (professional attention to vines, reverence for cycles). Diction is elevated but consistent, with occasional slips into lyricism that feel slightly imposed ("contentment's source...eluded her like smoke through cupped and desperate hands"). No dialogue; internal voice is coherent. The prose modulates well under pressure, but a few filter verbs ("she knew she must") and summary phrases ("she finally understood") dilute immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("breezy lighthouse," "bruised horizon," "protected vulnerability") that remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the paradox I wore," "invitation to embrace") that softens immediacy, and the keeper's sparse dialogue does not reveal distinct idiom. Purposeful compression in lyric passages is legible but does not fully escape self-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice adopts an elevated, lyric register ("sycamore hush," "the breath of the night") that stays consistent but borders on abstraction, especially in peak moments where embodied perception would sharpen urgency. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages without dramatizing the realizations through action. Perceptual signature is generic-mystical rather than character-specific; Mira's way of noticing doesn't reveal her particular history or biases.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV narration is stable and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("pulse left wandering through generations," "when the world was dreaming itself into being"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the skimmer notices echoes, harmonics, and temporal patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("temporal fabric," "consciousness ride the echoes") that distances the reader from embodied perception. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks the gritty specificity that would distinguish it from generic mystical-quest narration.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; diction ("unbinding wonder," "breathing evaporating memory," "brilliant dimness") establishes a lyric-philosophical register consistent with Vorrin's reflective temperament. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight during mist-dissolution, wider for the Refactory exposition. No dialogue; the piece sustains voice through concrete image and metaphor. Minor slip: "accommodate impossibilities" and "accommodates impossibilities" appear as both narratorial phrase and in-world property without clear line between Vorrin's thought and external descriptor, risking slight filter ambiguity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("a meteor hush that muffled even the gulls"), but the prose drifts into elevated diction that exceeds Elias's lexical baseline: "synesthetic palette," "signification," "phosphorescent ink." Psychic distance is stable, but the interior monologue over-explains the synesthetic experience ("a sound that tasted of silver and smelled of rain") rather than trusting embodied perception. No dialogue is present, and the perceptual signature, while poetic, lacks the selective bias that would distinguish Elias's professional or personal priorities under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("static bursts...a dialect of loss," "tuning fork struck against the anvil of entropy"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for moment-to-moment perception under pressure ("compressed nebulae, whole galaxies frozen in their death-throes" reads more authorial than focalized). No head-hopping; the voice is consistent but occasionally sacrifices immediacy for conceptual density.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance and a lyric, grief-soaked register: "twilight bled," "memory worn thin," "heart that had forgotten how to beat but still remembered how to ache." Perceptual signature is death-worker specific (she "guided him across," "pressed it flat for thirty nights"). Compression and patterned syntax ("blue ice," "amber," "clear quartz") fit the accumulative design. Minor register drift: "the dignity of being known" and "the distance that intimacy cannot cross" veer toward abstract essay voice in peak beats. One spoken line ("The thing beneath—it's always been there") from the cylinder is purposeful and voice-distinct. Free indirect is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent ("faded twilight," "cosmic imbalance," "plausible impossibility") and fits a lyric-fantasy register, though some phrases veer toward stock ("heart skipped," "wonder"). Perceptual signature is present (Kael notices dripping rates, engravings, vibrations) but not deeply character-particular. No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct texture, yet under peak pressure (bell strikes, fish return) the voice does not modulate or compress; it maintains the same elevation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a measured, slightly formal register ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush") that suits Nora's vigilant role. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices labels, photographs, structural remains—but the lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("expunge," "perfume of resurrection") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears. Focalization is clean; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm remains steady but doesn't modulate sharply under pressure, maintaining a lyric evenness even at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric register. The prose carries a distinct texture—elevated diction, mythic phrasing ("memory of a different age," "breath of a star")—that matches the orchard's timeless atmosphere. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess. However, the narrative voice is uniform and slightly generic across emotional beats; urgency does not modulate syntax or lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak: the alchemist notices silver apples and starling spirals but her way of seeing is not character-specific, reading more like omniscient pastoral description. The voice is competent and legible but lacks the rhythmic control and embodied particularity required for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third; psychic distance is controlled. The perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, sensory attention to vibrations and echoes) is consistent and character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the fragile thread holding them aloft," "timeless reminder") that feels authorial rather than emanating from the focalizer under stress. Free indirect style is clean, and internal thought formatting is consistent. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Rhythmic control is present but compression under peak stress is missing—the manual override beat maintains steady, literary cadence rather than tightening syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority at grief's return, wider angle during clone argument). Perceptual signature is present: the sensei's sight "slices through pretense," seeing "hollow core within each performance." Register holds (martial idiom: "kata of meaningless form," "tanto blade"). Deduction for mild filter-verb reliance in early paragraphs ("He could perceive," "He knew") and one late stock phrase ("testament to reawakened humanity") that dilutes voice specificity. No dialogue to assess. The prose reflects the mind under pressure, compressing at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Eleanor as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "spectral heart a bruised fruit," "warped as if sung through a damaged throat." Diction occasionally reaches for elevated phrases ("mournfully eager," "macerated the unsaid things") that feel slightly imposed rather than organic to Eleanor's voice, particularly in abstract clusters. The phrase "tending to the unspoken" recurs with thematic weight but borders on explanatory. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets don't apply. Psychic distance is controlled, and the closing shift to Sarah's perspective is brief and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the guardian; perceptual signature is consistent (architectural metaphors, dimensional vocabulary). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity," "interiorizing exteriors") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted for a feral creature. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are evident ("mist had become pages, the ice had become ink"), yet several beats rely on stock philosophical constructions ("waiting became a form of seeing") that flatten voice under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the narrative stance coheres, keeping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and Elara's perceptual signature ("pressure behind her eyes," "the penny drops, she thought") is distinct. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "catastrophic change," "the beauty of the incomplete." The narrative certainty stays within plausible bounds. The final lines ("Elara kept walking, her silhouette dissolving into the frozen bloom of the dying light") deliver strong rhythmic closure, but some interiority in the middle section ("creative destruction was not about destroying to build, but building within destruction itself") reads as exposition rather than lived thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, restrained texture ("Fantasy had no room for romance when signals were life and death"). Diction matches Mira's technical focus (amplifier modules, waveform analyzers, copper sang). However, some phrases drift into elevated register ("serenely electric," "a thing of impossible weight and lightness") that feel authorial rather than character-rooted. The repeated stem "She had assumed..." in close succession and the phrase "discarding assumptions like broken glass" read as template cadence, slightly flattening the perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (damp rail, sideways clock, silver threads) but lacks character-particular bias—Lina's noticing reads generically lyric rather than shaped by her deckhand experience or personal history. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ardent deckhand," "resiliently positive," "permanent transient") that sits uneasily with the voice's concrete anchors. The dialogue snippet from Captain Roedskal ("Time's sand ran out long ago") and Lina's radio transmission ("Tidemark to all echoes, we are merging now") carry subtext but are brief. Sentence rhythm varies, yet runs of "Lina [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" create mild template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with distinct diction ("moth wings," "phosphorescence," "realistically imaginary") and controlled psychic distance. The prose maintains a stable third-person close POV with no head-hopping. However, the register occasionally drifts into over-elevated metaphor ("rational enchantment," "liminal space between neural pathway and shared hallucination") that feels imposed rather than organically filtered through Mira's perception, especially in high-pressure beats where compression would serve urgency better.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV (Mara) with stable third-person limited focalization; no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel," "edge geometry"), though the register occasionally drifts into philosophical abstraction ("To where the horizon is still folded. To the edges of your own geometry"). Corin's single question carries natural syntax, but the Tethian elder's sung line ("Your geometry is correct, but horizons must be unfolded from within") reads more like conceptual summary than embodied speech. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("contact tracer for hearts," "reeling hush") and purposeful compression that suits the liminal atmosphere. Psychic distance remains stable, and the hearing aid's mediation of perception is voice-motivated. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("looming like ghostly sentinels," "fragile thread in the reeling hush") that feels more authorial than character-particular under stress. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the protagonist's spoken lines ("Lila, I am here," "Help is coming") advance goal and subtext without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV with tight focalization through Marek's augmented perception remains stable. Voice is distinct: technical diction ("quantum superposition," "photon," "fiber optics") anchored by visceral images ("bulkheads pressed like closing fists," "glaciers calving"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (short clauses in the moon-pool transition, longer cadences during reflection). No dialogue; interiority stays concrete. Minor: some filter verbs ("feeling the phase transition") are acceptable within voice but slightly dull immediacy in one beat. Perceptual signature—electromagnetic traces, phase-transition language—is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present (heartbeat counting, ink-pattern tracing) but leans abstract. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "midnight solace") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure but lacks a distinct rhythmic fingerprint under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register ("copper-veined," "articulate," "verdigris and dust") that matches the mythic setting. Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory details filter through texture and resonance metaphors. However, diction stays uniformly heightened without modulation under peak pressure—the moment she channels the spinebirds' syntax reads at the same register as earlier exposition. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("saw how," "understood") appear but remain voice-coherent within the lyric mode. The voice is distinct but does not degrade or sharpen when the translation attempt climaxes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent in register but overly uniform in rhythm and diction: nearly every paragraph opens with subject-verb declaratives and relies on "was" constructions. Elian's single line of dialogue ("The cryptid's song is a harmony untamed; it pulls at the soul") is on-theme but feels thesis-like rather than naturalistic. Psychic distance remains stable, though the piece withholds Lyn's specific grief ("love lost to shadows") without dramatizing why that omission serves pressure. No head-hopping, but the voice lacks the perceptual signature that would make Lyn's way of noticing distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register: "resonantly soft cry," "gap between knowing and understanding," "tarnished wonder." This diction is consistent and purposeful, creating a fable-like texture. However, under peak stress (the counter-pulse beat), the syntax does not compress or fragment—Elara's interiority remains equally ornate ("terrible moment," "surge upward through sky-bridge's cables"), flattening the pressure gradient. Perceptual signature is present but generic: she "watches," "feels," "realizes" in broad strokes rather than idiosyncratic noticing. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "boots clicked," "brittle hush," "cobalt neon" create a consistent textural filter. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between external action and internal reflection. No dialogue present; judge only narration. Diction remains character-apt (courier jargon, "respectfully rebellious") without register drift. Minor deduction for repeated syntactic stems in backstory beats ("He had missed… the letter had burned… each dusk he returned") that flatten momentum slightly, but the overall voice is controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Silas with a lyric, elevated register. Voice is distinct and purposeful: "ghost-light of forgotten spotlights," "whispering gleam," "the silence spoke a secret only he could hear." However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("field of possibility," "dormant melody") that distances rather than grounds. Psychic distance is controlled but uniformly remote; we never drop into close embodied interiority. The prose maintains its lyric texture under pressure without modulation, which fits the Accumulative design but flattens emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric-surreal register (e.g., "event horizons marked by dog-eared corners," "frozen sound waves"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, perceptual signature is generic: the librarian notices metaphorical constructs (black holes of narrative, scarf humming with lullabies) in omniscient poetic voice rather than character-specific idiom. The young man's single line of dialogue reads functional but generic. Syntax and diction are controlled, but elevated register ("analog memories flooded the chamber," "photons dusted his corduroy") persists even in peak beats, flattening urgency. No head-hopping, and tense is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on the librarian. Perceptual signature (allegorical, lyric) is consistent: "dreams that wandered from their shelves," "dawn began slow performance of luminous absence." However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("vitalize," "cipher of longing," "luminous transactions") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Sentence structure is rhythmic but mechanically uniform—most clauses follow noun-verb-metaphor construction. No dialogue present. The voice reads generic-lyric rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited narration maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric register ("fledgling thought trapped behind decades," "universe was a lock"). Psychic access remains consistent to Merrin except for brief dips into the woman's perception ("the woman gasped as the world reoriented"). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext ("This isn't a key"). The prose exhibits a coherent perceptual signature (cosmic, metaphor-laden) but leans on elevated diction throughout ("enveloped secrets," "conduit for cosmic possibility") without modulation for urgency. Under peak pressure (the unlocking moment), the narration remains in summary mode rather than tightening into concrete action, and the woman's voice in dialogue does not distinguish itself from Merrin's narration.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with Elias's scholarly, tactile perspective ("hands-on folklorist," "the chronically curious do not fear tetanus or ghosts"). Perceptual signature (measuring, cataloging, singing sailor chants) is character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable. However, several phrases feel like imposed framing rather than lived interiority: "crisp nostalgia" appears three times but remains abstract, and "the chronically curious are doomed to become the stories they chase" reads more authorial than character-rooted. Under peak pressure (memories flooding back), diction stays measured rather than destabilizing, missing an opportunity for rhythmic fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: the archivist's attention filters through archival detail (geometry of tea leaves, symbols, glyphs) and nervous habit. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("Will this set you free?" / "I could go back, but then who would teach you"). Diction stays consistent—precise, slightly formal, no register drift. The brief Lin dialogue ("It's beautiful") and the archivist's responses maintain distinct idiom. Sentence rhythm modulates from the opening's slow hush to the final paragraph's calmer breath without mechanical patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction, mythic cadence—but it does not modulate under pressure; the same textured prose persists through exposition, action, and closure without variation. Perceptual signature is generic: Vespera notices colors and essences but her way of noticing does not feel character-specific. The dialogue section ("Wonder must be woven," she would say) shifts into future-tense summary and loses immediacy. Filter verbs ("she would show," "she would say") stack in the final third, dulling voice-driven urgency (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice contamination but not duplicated).

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara, psychic distance consistent. Perceptual signature is present (mask restorer's lens, "leather patch," "porcelain, wood, feathered things") but diction drifts into elevated register under pressure: "calcified in her throat," "lucid unrest," "spectral geometry" feel writerly rather than character-particular. Sentence rhythm is controlled but syntactic patterns repeat (noun + prepositional phrase + abstract clause). No dialogue to judge. The net/pearl handling is legible but the line "interlaced hush was not empty; it was full of everything unsaid" reads as narrator intrusion rather than Elara's thought. Free indirect style is mostly clean; one filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("She was…She lifted…She had been") but not enough to disqualify 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited focalization. The perceptual signature—Elena's methodical, empathic attention to "faded ink," "textured history," and "the silence to speak"—is consistent and distinct. Diction remains controlled and voice-apt throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory interiority ("her methodical curiosity now tempered by a deep empathy") that tells rather than trusts the reader to infer from her actions, and the final paragraphs' cadence flattens into summary rather than maintaining the specificity of earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV with tight focus on Cassian; psychic distance is controlled and his perceptual signature (analytical precision, instrument-case detail) remains consistent. Dialogue between Cassian and Mort carries subtext and advances the thematic inquiry without exposition. Two frictions: occasional register drift into elevated diction ("the exhaustive mapping of its own tension," "sophisticated...melancholy") that exceeds Cassian's established interior lexicon under pressure, and Mort's lines occasionally serve more as thematic prompt than dramatized speech. Free indirect style is clean when present.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with stable third-person distance and purposeful compression ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert"). Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—both balladeer and scribe notice and act in identical patterns without distinct voice. No dialogue appears. Filter constructions ("felt the motivation," "seemed to echo") dull immediacy in several beats, and the elevated diction ("suspended garden," "luminous echo") remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Kai's perceptions with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but remains coherent and voice-motivated ("fractured into prismatic arrays," "filigree," "encryption was optical"). Perceptual signature is clear: Kai notices geometric precision, brass polish, steam curling—details reflecting their role and inquisitive nature. The captain's voice in the diary entries contrasts effectively with the framing narration. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "half expecting") fit the cautious, observant stance. The final meta-commentary shifts briefly into narrator-commentary rather than Kai's focalized thought, a minor distance slip that does not obscure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and aptly filtered through Mara's meteorological lens ("cumulonimbus to the east wasn't merely a CB—3; it was 'grief'"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in the final beats ("It was enough"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the recorder entry and breathing outward for the final sky-memory image. Perceptual signature is distinct: she reads clouds as emotions, cross-references data with human events, sees the telescope as "monument to what emptiness remembers." No dialogue present. Minor register elevation in "spooled wholeness" and "ionization of clouds" reads plausible for a meteorologist narrator but occasionally drifts toward exposition rather than lived thought under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("hollowed heart," "fractally precise," "drum against the silence"), creating a consistent atmospheric voice. However, the register remains uniformly poetic even under deadline pressure, flattening urgency. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (touch-based observation via coin, focus on geometry and light), but the syntax is template-uniform across beats: many sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Kael [verb]," reducing rhythmic variety under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (chartroom details, celestial obsession) is consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("the graphite a faint echo of the starlight"). Kess's dialogue is minimal but functional. Minor slip: "the airship humming in approval" and "its course forever changed" edge toward anthropomorphic narrator intrusion rather than strict Elara-filtered perception. No head-hopping; psychic distance is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and elevated, lacking perceptual signature or character-particular rhythm. Diction drifts into abstract lyricism ("the soft hush of a distant morning," "winter comet," "symphony of tiny heartbeats") that is atmosphere-only rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under stress. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular perspective, and the locksmith's way of noticing is indistinguishable from authorial mood-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person collective ("they," "the community"), but internal access is shallow and undifferentiated—no distinct perceptual signature or character-specific noticing. Diction occasionally inflates ("nebula of respite," "silent choreography," "brambled hope") beyond the grounded orchard-worker lexicon without voice motivation. Sentence rhythm is competent but falls into template cadence in the final third ("They learned to reexamine," "The butterfly garden, now a vibrant sanctuary," "Their story, etched"). No dialogue present to evaluate. Distance remains consistent, but the collective "they" lacks individual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose recycles stock constructions: "beautifully flawed" appears four times, "bruised awe" twice, "nested patterns" nine times, "pane of hush" seven times—template cadence without taught pattern. Perceptual signature is present (geometry, spirals, light refraction) but voice modulation under pressure is absent; diction remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she imagined") cluster in the climax without voice motivation, adding line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct narrative voice: "offhandedly exact," "cursed softly, the way she always did," "lonely as the last tree on the cliff." Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices "ridges familiar as her own knuckles," mechanical precision, and the frost's "crystalline fingers"—but some phrases drift into elevated register ("graceless beauty," "masterpiece of graceless beauty") that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent, appropriately, given the curse's enforced separation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual bias (symphonic framing, polymer metaphors). Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The "symphonically tuned mind" and recurring musical metaphors create a distinct texture, though some register drifts into elevated abstraction ("arabesques," "duet now silenced") feel slightly ornamental rather than voice-integrated. Elision of the sister's death and the lab work is purposeful and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("mindfully scattered," "phosphorescence of forgotten names"). The vendor's perceptual signature—quantifying absences, measuring emptiness—is idiosyncratic and held across beats. However, the dialogue ("I need to find the place where stories begin," "Only as much as birth") reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than goal-driven subtext, and the final-paragraph diction ("her purpose floating like the library itself—anchored only by the void it filled") tilts into abstract philosophizing that breaks the embodied texture established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and tightly controlled; perceptual signature reads chef-specific (tasting memories, analyzing geometry). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"the fortress rose from the sand like a broken tooth after the rain"—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Show me," "Here"). One pattern concern: runs of parallel constructions in the middle third ("The remorse flooded… subsuming… I became a vessel") approach template cadence, though voice remains coherent. The final paragraph's rhythm—short declaratives alternating with longer reflective lines—charges the closure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent ("vigorous tender," "hush of borrowed starlight"), but lacks perceptual signature—sensory detail feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue (Klaus, Ania, Miguel) is functional and culturally tagged by language snippets, yet their voices converge in tone and syntax; no distinct idiom or subtext. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose reads as a single authorial texture rather than Elara's particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-person but remains at declarative distance; the narrator explains rather than inhabits the engineer's perceptual signature. Diction inflates under pressure: "quaking reverie," "chaotically precise," "synaptic plasticity protocols she dreamed into existence" repeat as stock formulas without modulation. Interior access is shallow—thoughts are summarized ("she could no longer distinguish her own memories") rather than shown through specific misperception or choice. Sentence stems recur: "She [verb]" opens many lines, creating template cadence. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and vivid ("serpentine grotto," "clandestinely luminous"), though register occasionally elevates into prompt-like phrasing ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") that feels externally imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is professional-archivist observant but not deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance is consistent; no dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with controlled diction ("cathedral of slender trunks," "stress cracks that spiderweb across the glazed surface like sheet music"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, recurring abstract labels ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded," "tree-song sculptor") flatten POV particularity and read as thematic placeholders rather than the sculptor's lived idiom. No dialogue appears. Under peak moments (strumming, singing), the voice maintains its texture without head-hopping, but the reliance on repeated conceptual phrases prevents entry into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited. Voice carries a distinct lyric register ("twilight purpled the sky," "hopeful melancholy of a drawn position") with chess-saturated diction that reflects Kael's expertise. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, elevated metaphor density in peak beats ("ghost gambits," "magnetic twilight") occasionally obscures immediacy, and some interiority reads as writerly exposition ("translating silence had become his only method") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Mira is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance varies purposefully (close during frequency-tuning, slightly wider during reflection). Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated, poetic register ("thin as starlight," "hush of a held breath") that occasionally feels more authorial than character-particular. The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, though sentence openings recur ("She…" begins many paragraphs) and some beats use template phrasing ("Mira realized," "She imagined"). Filter verbs ("she imagined," "she realized") appear frequently but are voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("olfactorily sensitive," "tide's thought," "wildflower hush") that fits the mysterious setting but occasionally drifts toward ornamental phrasing. The minstrel's gift and the elders' testimonies are summarized rather than shown in direct dialogue, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent, but perceptual signature lacks sharp idiosyncrasy—Elias's way of noticing is poetic but not character-particular. Minor drift into thematic narration at closure ("the village continued to whisper its secrets") that externalizes rather than trusts the image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric—"whirling silence," "centrifuge of sound," "genetic grief"—which fits the speculative setting but occasionally drifts toward over-writing ("the courage to grow backward into one's roots") without grounding in Kael's lived idiom. Psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she heard") appear but do not overwhelm. Voice remains distinct and purposeful, though the register is uniform across emotional peaks and calmer beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. However, the perceptual signature is generic investigator rather than character-particular; her noticing defaults to procedural observation without idiosyncratic filter. Diction is competent but bland ("She noted," "She realized," "She imagined"), lacking rhythmic modulation under pressure. The voice reads as template rather than singular, with recycled sentence stems ("She moved," "She recorded," "She climbed") that flatten momentum. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lyra; no head-hopping occurs and the sculptor's segment is cleanly externalized. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans abstract ("oscillating repose," "luminous tide," "impossible dreams") without grounding in Lyra's embodied perception. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, yet internal voice converges toward poetic summary in the final third. Dialogue is absent; no test available.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register that suits the reflective mode. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory details filtered through the keeper's regret and wonder. However, diction occasionally slips into generic poetic phrasing ("glittered like forgotten stars," "silent sentinels") without strong character-specific coloring, and some filter verbs ("He wondered," "He recalled") dull immediacy in high-stakes beats. No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose establishes a consistent lyric register with controlled diction ("lucid turbulence," "dissonant chord"). However, Cassian's interiority reads as philosophical summary rather than character-specific perception; his way of noticing does not shift under the borrowed personalities despite the premise. The mathematician and poet lack distinct voices in their brief appearances. Purposeful compression is legible, but the narrative stance remains distant throughout, never modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual specificity ("dragonfly-wing," "silk ribbon," "green flames"). The prose carries distinct rhythm and the courier's attention filters setting through his emotional state. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the child's whisper and the courier's gift-line feel natural. However, filter verbs ("felt time thicken," "felt it vibrate," "felt alive") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy, and the final paragraph's "And so the ridge remained…" shifts into communal narrator voice without clear justification, blurring focalization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("shifted hush," "autonomic responses," "neural pathways") that fits Seraphine's scientific mystic persona. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("deception could reveal truth, that fiction could be more honest than fact") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is confident and controlled but lacks the perceptual signature—selective, biased noticing—that would push it into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, anchored in Mei's perceptual signature (noticing silence, weaving patterns, the weight of the bead). Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent, with purposeful compression ("a moment stripped of sound, a memory unmade"). Free indirect style is clean. However, several lines drift into over-literary register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "the hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "latent in her bones, quiet as the bead in her palm, patient as stone." The prose occasionally prioritizes metaphor over immediacy, especially in high-pressure beats where Mei's embodied experience could anchor more concretely. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ren throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—his lens on the forge, the anvil, his mother's teaching—but under peak pressure in the heart-chamber, diction elevates ("grief turned inside-out," "azure and clear") beyond his established blacksmith idiom. The interior voice shifts from grounded ("his knees trembled") to literary flourish ("the color of twilight betrayed by dawn") without consistent tonal anchoring. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("He understood," "He felt") cluster in the barter sequence, dulling immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with sensory-focused texture ("tasting the metallic memory," "invisible threads stretched across the bay"). However, perceptual signature is generic; Lira's way of noticing could belong to any mystical protagonist. The narrative distance slips into omniscient framing: "his spirit, fragmented and lost, had become the green glass shard" is presented as absolute fact rather than Lira's inference. Filter verbs cluster in the final third ("She realized," "She understood," "She felt"), flattening immediacy during the climax. No dialogue is present to evaluate, and the prose voice reads as neutral-literary rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and mood-driven with controlled diction ("warmly observant eye," "luminescent ache"). Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("quietly observing warmth," "fragment of the ocean's heart") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The prose carries a textured rhythm, but Caleb's perceptual signature is generic—his way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias beyond the label "reticent." No dialogue; internal voice is competent but not deeply individuated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic mystical-narrator rather than character-particular: "shadowed elation," "otherworldly routine," "living prophecy" could describe any mythic figure. Diction drifts into elevated register ("harbinger of tempest," "fabric of tomorrow") inconsistent with embodied interior. Dialogue (one ship captain, one Herald shout) is functional but brief. The prose shows consistent tense and clean mechanics, but voice lacks specificity and the narrator's way of noticing is stock rather than selective.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice sustains a consistent lyric-philosophical register with vivid image clusters (valley mist, iridescent caution, sun trails). POV remains stable third-limited on the master throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevated register ("liminal space between earth and sky," "intangible," "beacon of iridescent caution") that feels authorial rather than rooted in the dye master's specific perceptual signature. The stranger's dialogue carries subtext but her aphoristic phrasing risks sounding like thematic delivery rather than character-specific speech.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Elara's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "the labyrinth exhale," "the trees whispered their secrets in rustling leaves." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (her fingers brushing metal) to wider lyric register (the map as web of scattered dreams). Occasional elevated phrasing ("mundane miracle," "quantified sorrow") reads voice-motivated rather than intrusive. No head-hopping, no dialogue to judge; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("shards of the past," "tapestry of frayed threads"), creating a distinct lyric register. However, the voice lacks character-specific perceptual signature—descriptions read interchangeable across beats rather than filtered through Elias's particular way of noticing. Compression and poeticism are purposeful but do not vary under pressure; the same ornate cadence persists from opening to climax, flattening emotional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to Mira's bookish interiority. However, the narrative voice often slips into thesis-statement mode ("This was the library's true secret: every volume contained its opposite argument") that reads as authorial commentary rather than character-filtered perception. Diction remains largely uniform across emotional beats—the same philosophical vocabulary in calm reflection and supposed crisis moments. Free indirect discourse is handled cleanly, and the perceptual signature (books as living conversations, time as "enlarged tranquility") is specific to Mira, but the syntax maintains a steady, measured rhythm that doesn't vary with urgency or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled rhythms ("crinkled like dried leaves," "whisper encouragement to struggling sprouts") and a consistent register that blends Mara's perceptual signature with poetic distance. Psychic distance is stable in third-person limited. However, certain phrases—"heuristically gentle rebellion," "tenuous absolution," "liminal space between what had been and what might be"—drift into elevated academic diction that feels authorial rather than rooted in Mara's lived idiom. The congregation members do not speak, so dialogue is absent. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice occasionally prioritizes texture over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited stance remains stable, and diction carries a consistent lyric register ("quartz hush," "luminous vows"). However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—observations are generic and interchangeable rather than filtered through the chief's specific expertise or emotional bias. Repeated syntactic stems ("The chief adjusted," "The chief felt," "The chief knew") create template cadence across high-pressure beats, flattening rhythm and violating the loop-check guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and carries a distinct perceptual signature: "rotting pier stretched into the black water like a forgotten promise," "Time pressed against my ribs like a second heartbeat." Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. The diction occasionally drifts elevated ("clandestine footsteps," "truce of hush") but remains within a literate young woman's plausible register under duress. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease" feel more authorial than character-particular. Free indirect handling of reflection is clean; filter verbs ("I realized," "I discovered") are voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara's perceptual signature: taste as primary sense, skepticism embodied in bioluminescence flicker, diction that blends scientific ("emergent properties") with lyric ("terrestrially cosmic"). Dialogue from the weather-carrier carries distinct cadence ("We don't carry the weather...we are the compromise") with subtext of hail and cyclone. However, some register drift occurs in abstract passages ("a terrestrially cosmic negotiation," "fungalese") that edge toward exposition. Purposeful compression in the convergence sequence (sourness, metallic sharpness, wet earth) maintains momentum and voice-motivated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "charcoal-fingered," "stained fingers," "texture familiar," "soft scratch of charcoal on stone." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during lock work, wider for cave overview). Diction remains within Elena's register; no corporate or academic drift. The piece uses free indirect style effectively ("She realized that her creativity had never truly been corked") though one or two lines veer toward helpful-narrator summary. No dialogue is present. Rhythmic control is evident in the final paragraph's cadence shift. Compression under stress (lock-solving beat) maintains voice consistency. Strong execution with minor tonal seams in expository reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic ("her heart quickening," "a whisper of paper") without character-particular texture. Diction remains consistent, though register drifts toward elevated abstraction in reflective passages ("a testament to candor's power," "the soil of memory"). The guard's dialogue and the tape snippet are brief but functional. Psychic distance stays controlled, yet the voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax remains even across discovery, descent, and closure without tightening or shift.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds a consistent elevated register throughout, with diction ("tremor of unspoken things," "glisten with meaning") that matches the lyric-mythic mode. Psychic distance remains stable and purposeful, though the narrator's certainty about what villagers remember and the child's inner seeing ("she saw through time to when whales sang") brushes against POV leakage. No dialogue appears. The voice carries a distinct texture—rhythmic, incantatory—but syntactic patterns repeat (long clauses with nested subordination) without modulation under the child's arrival, which should intensify pressure. The perceptual signature is consistent but not character-particular; it reads as authorial voice rather than the tuner's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is distinctly android-inflected ("servos misfiring," "processors split into fragments," task lists intrude during crisis). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the burn sequence. The prose voice maintains technical precision while layering emotional texture: "their ceramic joints now fluid, strangely organic in their movement." No filter-verb stacks; consciousness rendered through concrete malfunction rather than abstract meditation. One brief register wobble: "terrifying wonder of growing" reads slightly elevated for the established voice, though recoverable as filtered through Emma's residue.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature (reading "secret histories in chipped porcelain") establishes voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elena's whisper and Samir's low voice carry subtext. However, multiple passages drift into elevated register not grounded in Mira's interiority: "the stories woven through these walls were worth more than concrete and glass," "the greatest finds aren't things you can hold, but the connections you unlock." These read as thematic commentary rather than character-particular perception. The phrase "sandstorm calm" is applied to Elena's voice and then to the ending ("The sandstorm had passed, leaving only calm"), but the metaphor's vehicle—sandstorm—contradicts the established atmosphere of a jasmine courtyard at dawn, creating figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the voice carries a lyric, heightened register ("silken thread linking her fear of drowning to the power of breath") that feels intentional and consistent. Perceptual signature is present—Lyra notices the spider, the diodes, the taste of iron—in ways that reflect her code-breaker mindset. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur. The voice modulates little under pressure; peak moments (the final dance, the flood) maintain the same elevated diction without tightening or fragmenting, which slightly flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp—Kael notices gravity effects, scents, textures, but his diction ("massive silence," "gleaming silence," "fractured light") recurs in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. The prose modulates under pressure (shorter syntax in the chamber) but maintains elevated register throughout, even at peak stress. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Mara's line at the end advances plot and carries subtext (recognition without full memory). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "saw") are frequent but voice-motivated. Minor penalty for register consistency that doesn't degrade appropriately under physical strain (Kael navigating lethal gravity pockets with lyric composure) and for recycled phrase stems ("the gleaming silence").

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices water code, origami precision, frequency geometry). Diction is mostly controlled, though "terrestrially cosmic" and "tranquil blaze" repeat as ornamental labels without functional variation. Narrative distance is consistent. No dialogue present. Under peak pressure (the brook fighting back), syntax compresses appropriately. Minor register drift: phrases like "the essential geometry of his task" and "the benign babble of a stream" occasionally float above the established voice without clear motivational anchor in Elias's technical mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Alex's architectural idiom ("fire escapes conjugate verbs," "water damage as lament"). Diction is consistently elevated and metaphor-dense ("lithographer's chisel," "manuscript of burning letters"), fitting the lyric Accumulative mode. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Mrs. Voss's lines ("Borrowing sugar becomes tea becomes truth") carry subtext and thematic weight. Weakness: the metaphorical register flattens under emotional pressure (meteor shower, basement ritual) rather than tightening; Alex's internal voice remains observational throughout, without modulation that would signal stance shift or cost. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the uniform lyricism across all beats prevents 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV narration maintains consistent third-person limited access to Elara's perceptions and thoughts. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout ("liminal moment," "resonance structures," "ghostly resolve"), matching the lyric-accumulative design. However, the register remains uniformly heightened even in peak emotional beats, with little modulation under pressure. The sister's quoted voice carries distinct phrasing, and free indirect style is clean. Elision of how "resonance structures" function is purposeful and taught early, paying off at closure when Elara speaks through them rather than translating them.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with a fairy-tale distance ("a calligraphy forger," "a gardener of legends") and purposeful compression in phrases like "ink and memory" and "key with no apparent lock." Free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature remains stable. However, the voice trends toward generic lyricism rather than character-particular diction; under pressure, the syntax does not tighten or fracture to reflect Elara's urgency, and filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation. The final paragraphs shift into summary mode, diluting the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("serpentine nexus," "reed-blown melancholy," "whispering seashell half"), teaching an accumulative voice early. However, the narrative distance is unstable: moments of close perception ("She felt the reed-blown melancholy deepen") alternate with omniscient cosmic framing ("the universe hummed on, indifferent") without clear motivation. The Echo Singer's perceptual signature is more atmospheric label ("richly perceptive") than a character-specific way of noticing, and the recurring phrases begin to feel algorithmic rather than voice-driven by the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and atmospheric, favoring poetic compression ("breath turning to silver mist," "form translucent as starlight borrowed from a distant sky"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific (e.g., "weaves truth carefully" recurs as a thematic tag rather than a perceptual signature). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the final dream sequence's ontological shift (waking with a physical globe) is not cued by prior POV rules, creating a small unreliability question without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person omniscient distance is stable, but the voice is generic literary-descriptive without perceptual signature. Diction is elevated and uniform ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "interwoven moonlight and mortal toil") regardless of pressure. Kael and the philosopher share identical register in thought and speech. No psychic modulation or textural shift reflects character state.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clean focalization through Elias. The prose carries a distinctive post-apocalyptic investigative texture: "radioactive dust storms scoured everything else to glass," "excavating truth from comfortable lies," "a skeleton from dust." Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and wider context. Minor register inconsistencies appear—"requisite cutter that scattered gamma rays" uses technical diction that feels slightly elevated for the wasteland investigator voice, though it remains within plausible bounds for someone trained in pre-liberation bureaucracy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose establishes a lyric, elevated register—"thunder gnawed," "ionic fracture," "greasy smell of vacuum tubes"—that coheres as Atlas's perceptual signature. Distance remains stable in third-person limited throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into abstract or poetic elevation ("lyrically prophetic cadence stitching quantum hiss into poetry") that prioritizes sound over clarity and sometimes obscures the mechanics of what Atlas is doing. The voice is consistent but not always anchored in the concrete urgency of the moment; peak beats favor metaphor over embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance; narrative diction ("feral loft," "lonesome splendor," "invisible architecture of sound") sustains a lyric register appropriate to a poet protagonist. Perceptual signature shows in how she notices sound and texture ("melody that tasted of honey and rust"). Two slips lower the score: "positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" reads as narrator commentary rather than character-filtered observation, and several passages ("redemption, she believed, could only be gleaned") use elevated abstraction that sits uneasily with the sensory specificity elsewhere. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Perceptual signature exists: the engineer's sensory world is filtered through acoustic and vibrational terms. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure moments ("sonic absolution," "frequency parasite," "sympathetic resonance," "duet of deliverance") that feel more authorial than character-bound. The phrase "logically emotional creature" and "no third option in her engineer's lexicon" read as external framing rather than lived voice. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness," "lunar azimuth"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, several lines drift into expository telling that paraphrases rather than advancing interiority: "Her restraint was a wildness held in check, a river dammed until its power could reshape stone" explains the metaphor instead of trusting the image. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she watched") are present but not excessive. The prose maintains narrative distance and voice coherence under pressure, though sentence stems repeat ("She had," "The," "Elara") across multiple paragraphs without purposeful variation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a noir-investigator register ("watchfully calm gaze," "fortified vulnerability"). Perceptual signature is consistent but leans on stock phrases: "entangled memories," "tight leash," "reverberate." Voss appears only via phone, so dialogue is minimal and functional. The prose modulates with pressure (short beats when Mara uploads evidence) but falls into templated cadence in reflective passages ("She felt…," "She knew…"). Free indirect style is clean, though the lexicon occasionally drifts into essay register ("controlling influence," "complicity") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited through the chaplain with controlled psychic distance and a distinct contemplative texture ("This is the calm before realization"; "by the way light breaks through storm clouds"). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, and Marlowe's speech ("This is how we turn an apology into action") advances theme without on-the-nose exposition. However, perceptual signature weakens under pressure—the chaplain's observations at peak moments ("reminded the chaplain of grace") read as authorial curation rather than character-specific noticing. The prose occasionally slips into elevated register that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; Zephyr's perceptual signature ("steadily curious," task-focused) is consistent. Diction is purposeful and idiosyncratic ("phosphor-coated grease," "ghost logic," "transliteration engine"), though elevated register occasionally drifts from a cart-glider's plausible lexicon ("recursive loop that desired its own improvement"). Rhythm modulates appropriately at the resonator activation. The single line of dialogue—"That's completely unnecessary"—lands with subtext and advances tone, but offers limited test of naturalism or character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is present ("brightly attentive") but the diction often drifts into elevated register ("chorus of absence," "mantra of loss") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The phrase "a world unaware of the ghosts in its wires" and repeated abstract constructions (echo, absence, silence) flatten the voice into a homogeneous lyric tone. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster in several lines without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates beyond Kael's established perceptual signature: "Courage meant mapping empathy onto action despite fear" and "Memory and matter, intertwined by intention" read as authorial framing rather than character thought. Filter verbs ("felt the silence," "letting impressions settle") cluster in reflective beats without urgency. Voice is coherent but not distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register; perceptual filtering is consistent (ice as mirror, wind as chorus). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats without variation: "windborne solace," "fold in patience," "grips reality loosely" repeat as formula rather than modulating under stress. The prose maintains poetic compression throughout but sacrifices embodied immediacy; the narrator observes the protagonist's transformation from a poeticized distance rather than inhabiting her visceral uncertainty. No dialogue appears, appropriately for the solitary frame.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated lyricism ("autumn's last light," "balm that coaxed understanding"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("intersubjective understanding," "gracious acceptance") that feels externally imposed rather than filtered through the sentinel's lived idiom. The prose maintains a single texture but does not modulate under pressure; the same meditative cadence persists across all beats. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-limited but perceptual signature is generic—"peripheral awareness" and "strangely honest" are told traits without distinct lexicon or rhythm that differentiate this narrator's noticing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("sacred geometry," "testament to her strangely honest purpose") that reads imposed rather than voice-motivated. Template cadence pervades: "The [noun] [verb], [article] [noun]" recurs across dozens of lines without rhythmic variation. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression is signaled (lyric/accumulative mode) but the pattern does not teach a rule or pay off with reweighted cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a consistent, elevated register. Perceptual signature exists ("she could almost hear the machines humming") but is generic across the field rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator occasionally drifts into omniscient summary ("the town began to heal"). One brief dialogue exchange with the child is functional but does not advance plot or carry subtext. Diction is uniform and somewhat abstract ("topography of memory," "cartography of sorrow") without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV, third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature: scholar's idiom ("lexical accumulation," "sonic reflectivity") mixed with lyric compression ("dawn's gray breath," "suspended hush"). No head-hopping. Diction remains stable under pressure; the final beats compress rhythm appropriately. Minor friction: "sonically reflective" in line 8 edges toward exposition, though it is immediately dramatized. The voice modulates across emotional beats (discovery, weeks of work, devastation, calm departure) without convergence. Elias's internal register (reticent precision) matches the narration throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with lyric elevation ("the hush of old videotapes," "tidal longing"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, but the perceptual signature is generic: repeated constructions ("He knelt," "He pressed," "He turned") flatten the texture. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he thought") appear frequently but remain voice-legible. The final paragraphs compress into summary mode ("he had learned," "he would not remember"), reducing immediacy at closure. Psychic distance widens when pressure should tighten, and the prophet's way of noticing is poetic but not character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.2)
    Single-POV third-person remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (auditory focus: "metallic hiss," "faint rustle," "whisper") but diction drifts into elevated register—"luminous ache," "bittersweet symphony," "timeless shard"—that exceeds a repairer's lexicon during peak pressure. Recycled sentence stems ("The leaf fell," "Kael realized," "Kael knew") and phrase loops ("luminous ache" appears five times) flatten voice texture and trigger template-cadence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited on Elara is stable and the perceptual signature ("decisively kind," "hymning the mundane") is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Lena's whispered goodbye and Elara's invitation to "listen" feel purposeful. However, elevated diction ("poem of finality," "sacred space she had sculpted from sound") drifts above the POV's grounded professionalism under pressure. The final paragraph's summary narration—"Elara walked down the hall, humming softly"—tells closure rather than showing it, blunting immediacy. Filter verbs ("she imagined," "she believed") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices runes, gears, shadows—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sealed pocket," "luminous lattice") without clear voice anchoring. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative certainty fits what Elara can know. No dialogue; interiority is functional but leans on filter constructions ("She realized," "She recognized") that dull immediacy. The prose reflects her deliberate nature through pacing, a purposeful alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Elena with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled, though some phrases drift into abstraction ("cleft in certainty wide enough to swallow," "edifice crumbled"). Moira's dialogue carries subtext ("certainty is a kind of cruelty"), but Elena's internal voice occasionally flattens into summary. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific. The final telescope passage shifts toward lyric register purposefully, supporting the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mira throughout. Perceptual signature is present (star-watcher filtering through celestial comparison) but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a village artisan: "a beacon that needed no flame," "collective glow of countless sea-glass pearls." No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—polishing, climbing, and placement all carry the same lyric cadence without tightening. Pronoun references and tense remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual filtering consistent to Elara's introspective, slow-healing stance. Diction is elevated and lyric ("honeyed hush," "cathedral of quiet decay"), fitting the accumulative mode. However, register occasionally drifts into writerly exposition—"quietly proactive in her healing" and "protected vulnerability" read as authorial labels rather than emergent perception. Rhythmic control is strong in image-building passages; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the interior access. Voice is distinctive but tilts explanatory at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV with consistent third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (ink metaphors, writer-world diction) but the voice converges on a uniform lyric register across all emotional beats—grief, recognition, release sound identical in syntax and rhythm. Under peak stress (younger-self encounter, shell-crack moment), the prose does not compress or shift cadence; it maintains the same swirling, decorative texture throughout. Psychic distance remains stable, but the lack of modulation flattens emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (tinkerer's toolbox rattle, "threads" and "coil" diction) is consistent but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance holds steady, though the shift to villagers' collective experience in the final third ("curious folk," "elders who had long given up") broadens the lens without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in alchemical and cartographic metaphor ("flash-paper," "sigil," "constellation of silver dots"). Diction is elevated and purpose-driven, matching the ritualistic tone. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the sealing and opening during the final approach. Minor register consistency: "safekept" and "moving stillness" recur as deliberate motifs rather than filler. No head-hopping or filter clutter; voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature—oblique glances, pattern detection—colors every beat. Diction is consistent (chronomantic, temporal residues, acoustic memory) and voice-specific, though register occasionally drifts into elevated exposition ("oblique glances," "architecture so completely"). No dialogue; all evaluation rests on narrative texture. Peak-stress compression is absent because the locksmith never faces crisis; his calm, methodical voice suits the reflective mode but lacks modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, no POV leakage, and the final image maintains focalization ("his own reflection seemed to smile from the periphery").

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is consistent and lyric ("boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush," "whalebone light"), creating a distinct textural signature. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation: "by orienting properly" and "calcify each one, transforming ephemeral ache into fossilized record" read more ornamental than urgent. Psychic distance stays controlled, though the narrator's perceptual signature leans toward archetypal wisdom rather than individual quirk.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable; focalization through Mara is clean. Diction carries a poetic register ("hauntingly practical," "ghost-sharp," "rust-hued peace") that remains consistent but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("crystallized time," "fleeting imprint on a surface"). The kettle's whistle and carving rhythm provide purposeful sensory modulation. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is present—grief filtered through artisan detail—but the voice lacks contradiction or pressure-driven compression at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable and first-person interiority is distinct ("chronologically confused," "memories drifting like leaves"). Diction is purposefully lyric and compressed. The ghost's dialogue ("You cannot undo what is eroded...") reads as voice-motivated rather than expository. However, phrases like "a narrative of redemption" and "negotiating peace" drift toward abstract summary that slightly flattens the texture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Diction carries some perceptual signature ("maze of intentions," "quiet engine") that reflects her engineering mindset, and the narrative voice modulates with her mood. However, register drifts into elevated/abstract phrasing at emotional peaks ("stoic wonder," "apneic stillness," "soft thunder of tiny engines") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") cluster in reflection without adding immediacy, and the prose leans on metaphor where concrete action would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's way of noticing is filtered through time, silence, and craft (footsteps "softer than falling snow," chronometer gears as "memories she could finally examine"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("excruciatingly gentle," "petrichor nostalgia," "glacial hush"). No dialogue; interiority is specific and avoids filter stacks. The phrase "she understood then" at the epiphany beat borders on convenient certainty, but the prior layering of image and ritual anchors the shift plausibly enough. Rhythm modulates with the ritual's progression, accelerating slightly at the sung harmony and settling into calm at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and carries a consistent lyric register. However, register is elevated beyond the immediate scene needs, creating distance rather than intimacy. Figurative language is dense ("liquid ribbon of amber and violet," "pages of a forgotten codex," "syncopated beat of deceit") in nearly every sentence, flattening rather than modulating pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices in catalogue fashion rather than character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-person-limited with tight focalization through Elara. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices fiber, texture, and pattern—and diction remains controlled ("salt-stiffened coils," "oceanic hush"). Kessler's dialogue ("beach-glass witchery") carries distinct idiom and the brief exchange lands subtext (his skepticism softens to respect). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the narrative distance remains apt. Prose rhythm modulates with the fog's press and the decoding sequence, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled diction and rhythm. Perceptual signature is present (notices "echoes of explained absences," "lonesome splendor") but remains abstract and generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. However, peak moments rely on stock elevated phrasing ("the thought was a weight, but a release") and therapy-adjacent metaphor ("geography of healing") that flattens specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction is elevated and uniform, lacking a distinct perceptual signature tied to Lysander's bedraggled circumstances or princely past. Key phrases ("bitterly sweet luminescence," "quaking reverie," "flawed genesis") recur across paragraphs as authorial texture rather than character-specific perception. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") appear frequently without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under the emotional peaks (egg cracking, song spreading). The prose reads as narrated essay rather than lived interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic (migrating clouds, kelp-drift peace) and lacks character-specific bias. Diction is consistent but elevated without variation under pressure ("gracefully alert," "testament to survival"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She imagined," "She felt," "She knew") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable; POV distance and tense are consistent. Voice carries a lyric texture ("embers of a star that had lost faith in the sky") that occasionally drifts into elevated diction incongruent with the plot's simplicity ("defiant hush" repeated as motif rather than felt state). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Kael's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selectivity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices computational patterns, spectral light, recursive structures—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("troubling serenity," "quantum loam," "mathematical elegies") that risks ornament over embodied perception. Psychic distance is mostly controlled, though some lines ("she understood now," "she had completed the transit") tell understanding rather than showing its arrival. Syntax varies purposefully, with lyric compression at key beats. Filter verbs ("understood," "heard," "felt") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. Perceptual signature is consistent—stone dust, glass, stitched verses—and voice modulates appropriately from work detail to meditative ritual. Dialogue with the ghost is sparse and purposeful. Minor register drift: "topography of communal mourning" and "spectral mentorship" feel slightly elevated for a gravestone carver's interior lexicon, though they could pass as free indirect reflection. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature (timekeeper's precision: "particular curl of his 'g'," "infinitesimal stillness"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Minor slip: "searing reverie" in the final paragraph and "ethical diligence" feel slightly elevated for the established register, risking brief register drift. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought," "understood") are used purposefully to modulate distance. No head-hopping. Narrative certainty stays within Elara's knowledge bounds. Compression under pressure (short inscriptions, pause metaphor) is purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (the gardener's attention to threads, colors, weaver's calloused fingers) is consistent but generic—any archivist might notice these details. Diction remains elevated and slightly formal throughout ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt," "sovereign case"), which fits the tone but lacks modulation under pressure. The repeated phrase "tenderly organized" and "uncharted echoes" signal voice tics rather than organic perception. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Kaelen notices freeze-thaw cycles, tremors, thermal gradients). Diction is controlled and purposeful—"mind's lattice," "pattern stones," "divining rod for hope"—though "groundedly imaginative, a rarity among dreamers and engineers alike" reads as authorial summary rather than dramatized perception. The elders' brief dialogue ("traced the borehole angles with a weathered finger") carries goal and subtext, but the final council scene compresses their voices into reported action, flattening what could have been a charged exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; diction is lyric and controlled with a consistent perceptual signature (dust as listeners, notes as ghosts). However, the prose leans heavily on repeated syntactic stems—"She believed," "She imagined," "She dreamed," "She whispered"—and the same metaphoric vehicle (dust) recurs across nearly every beat without evolving pressure. Under peak moments, the voice remains at a single lyric register without modulation, and filter verbs ("believed," "imagined," "prayed") stack in adjacent lines, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (ash, charcoal, porcelain, vanishing lines) is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric but often generic ("ghost of cedar and memory," "forgotten ink," "quiet echo") rather than character-particular. Sentence stems recur ("She seeks," "She studies," "She intends," "She thinks," "She wonders," "She decides") creating template cadence that flattens voice under pressure. No dialogue is present; interiority is abstract and summary-heavy, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Malach's archaeologist-philosopher perspective. Diction is controlled ("rationally rebellious," "voice flat as a tidal table") and reflects his scientific bent without slipping into exposition. The single line of dialogue—"This is what happened"—carries subtext (defiance, precision) and advances the beat. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts appear. Under pressure, the prose compresses appropriately ("He filed faster, his rebellion not in shouts but in precise, defiant geometry").

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchors in Mrs. Kaelin's perceptual bias (thirty autumns, traveled stillness) with consistent narrative distance. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Marco's raised hand, Mrs. Kaelin's "Pass it on" feel purposeful. However, certain lines ("She was expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "vanishing arts") repeat elevated diction that, while voice-motivated, risks self-conscious lyricism under emotional pressure. The decades-long summary in the final third shifts psychic distance without clear cue, and the prose occasionally slides into authorial observation rather than strictly character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Mara's synesthetic perception ("tasting the air," "flavors strengthened her resolve") provides a distinct perceptual signature. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "crucible of renewal") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. No dialogue is present. Reflection is frequent but anchored to present stimuli (vines, soil, light). Under peak stress (alignment peaks, fruit appears), the prose maintains rhythm without head-hopping, though some lines veer toward lyric declaration rather than immediate thought.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara's perceptual signature—"involuntary candor still sharp," the taste of nectar dusk, tactile engagement with gearwork and rust—remains consistent and purposeful. However, several beats slip into elevated, poetic diction that doesn't quite fit a tollgate worker's lexicon: "nectar dusk light, the kind that turns ordinary wires into threads of honey" and "uncharged possibility" read as authorial flourish rather than character-filtered perception. The dialogue with the child is brief and natural, and the matchbox/riddle mechanic is clean, but voice modulation under pressure could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the voice is generic and tonally uniform—elevated diction ("inadvertently profound," "sanctify," "hushed blaze") recurs without character-specific texture. Perceptual signature is absent; the protagonist notices in catalog fashion without bias or selective attention shaped by urgency. Reflection dominates (~40% of the text) with minimal present anchoring: "He had learned," "He knew," "He realized" loop without micro-choices altering present tactics. Psychic distance remains fixed at summary remove, flattening pressure at every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchored tightly to Petra's stone-and-telepathy perspective. Voice is consistent with elevated, lapidary diction ("limestone that formed her bones," "silt through water") that fits the statue narrator. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains stable. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "crushing clarity" and "animate lifeless" recur as near-mantra, creating a slight template cadence in the final third. Perceptual signature (telepathy, stone-time perception) is distinct and sustained. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax when Petra threads the ampoule, longer lyric rhythms in the epilogue-like ending), though the epilogue's summary mode ("decades later") risks distancing at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: mathematical diction ("nanometer," "0.003% favor," "waveform") fuses with metaphysical urgency ("cosmic indifference," "corrupted pixel"). POV remains stable third-limited. However, phrases like "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" read as authorial summary rather than embodied perception, and the register occasionally elevates beyond the focalizer's lived urgency ("perpetual motion didn't liberate him; it bound him"). Perceptual signature—counting, calculating, reading micro-variations—remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Kael; psychic distance is stable and voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("saffron quiet," "moon-singers," "quiet prayer"). The prose maintains distinct texture in word choice and rhythm, with purposeful compression ("insomnia became a ritual"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is present but narrow—Kael's lens stays in hopeful observation mode throughout. Under peak pressure (the fullest crescent, the herb bundle), diction remains elevated without modulating to match urgency, which slightly flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Liora, and the prose carries a formal, museum-guide register ("cultured," "historically oriented"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("mournful symphony," "fragile threads connecting past and present") that feels authorial rather than Liora's lived perception under stress. Dialogue is absent, so no test of subtext or voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation—high-pressure moments (thawing the ice) receive the same measured cadence as exposition, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering detail through the clockmaker's professional bias (gears, alignment, reverse-engineering). Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees mechanisms and patterns. Diction is elevated and lyric ("grey finger pointing at a slate sky," "hunger that ate the light"), which fits the narrative stance but occasionally drifts into generic poetic register ("bleak exhilaration," "defiance carved from stone") that feels less character-particular than authorial. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. The keeper's presence is minimal and his interiority is appropriately opaque. Minor repetition of stems ("she had," "she would") and stacked adverbial openers appear in mid-section but do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (oily luminance, ghostlights) is character-specific and sustained. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats—"unbosom," "devotee's prayer is the tyrant's interrogation," "manifestating as flickering entities"—that clashes with the embodied, sensory voice established earlier ("stomach clench," "edges bit her palm"). The advisor's riddle-speak is intentionally stylized, but when narration adopts similar ornamentation ("repulsive allure that pulled even as it repulsed") without grounding in Mira's lexicon, voice coherence slips. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic ("restless euphony," "sketched resonance"), consistent throughout. Perceptual signature leans abstract—clouds become "predictive geometries," sound becomes "bronze ripples"—rather than character-particular. The prophet's way of noticing reads more as authorial voice than individuated perception, and the voice does not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Kael's cartographer perception (calcium geometries, spiral patterns, shell-mapper's tools). Voice is consistent and purposeful, with a measured, almost incantatory rhythm that matches the mythopoetic setting. Perceptual signature is clear: she reads histories in swirls, sees maps in cracks. Distance control is clean. Minor template cadence in mid-section beats ("She began to see it: the growth patterns…"; "Following its fracture lines…") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is stable and third-person limited stays controlled; no head-hopping occurs. Narrative distance is consistent and diction ("methodical heart," "emotionally rational approach") establishes a formal, slightly elevated register appropriate to an academic character. However, perceptual signature is generic—Emlyn's way of noticing (ivy, rails, windows) could belong to any thoughtful observer rather than a "fictional historian" with discipline-specific bias. Psychic distance remains static; the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under the letter-discovery beat, which should be a peak moment. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she realized") appear frequently but remain voice-neutral rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout; perceptual signature filters detail through Elias's surveyor training (bolted rungs, hydraulic lime ratios) and accumulating emotional charge without head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—concrete, measured, with controlled lyricism ("copper light," "green-filtered light," "hushed blaze")—and the elevated register fits the antiquarian, solitary figure. The compression "tears—though he would never admit to weeping underwater" uses em-dash elision to preserve his stoic mask while revealing cost, a purposeful distance modulation. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short declaratives during the cornerstone wrestle contrast with longer, layered sentences in reflective beats. No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance shifts are intentional and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and Mira's professional lexicon (indexer, hypothesis, registry) anchors voice. Psychic distance is consistent. However, diction peaks into elevated register at emotional beats ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive calm," "exhalation of musty breath") that feel imposed rather than character-particular. The prose reads competent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable focal distance and the prose carries a lyric, elevated texture ("each fold was a descent into memory"). Register remains consistent—no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, perceptual signature is generic: the lantern maker's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or hierarchy. Diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("luminous torment," "recorded dream") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is character-specific (geodes as wedding memory, microvolts as grief). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("bleak exhilaration," "geography of what never happened"). Deduct −0.5 for register drift in peak beats: "perturbation sequences that nudged reality just enough to make it confess" and "immaculate potential" elevate diction beyond Kael's established idiom during high-pressure moments. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer. Voice carries a consistent lyric-technical texture ("frequencies of belonging," "perpetually surprised"), and diction fits the character's role as pilot-decoder. However, elevated register ("paradoxical glow," "brilliant dimness," "nebulae") occasionally drifts above situational urgency, and several lines read as authorial commentary rather than Elara's lived perception. The piece avoids head-hopping and filter-verb stacks, but the perceptual signature lacks the sharp, idiosyncratic selectivity required for higher bands. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and carries a formal, slightly elevated register appropriate to the reflective mode. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. However, the prose leans heavily on filter verbs ("he felt," "seemed to") and abstract phrasing ("weight of unspoken words," "sieved hush") that dilute immediacy. No dialogue appears. The watch hand "pulsed" and "ticked softly" in the final lines—contradictory since it is broken—suggests a loose metaphor rather than controlled perception.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady through Kael's perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Diction ("storm-worn," "furrowed hush," "silvery scythe") establishes a literary register that remains consistent. The brief dialogue ("whispered a reassurance") carries subtext but is too slight to test naturalism or character distinction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interior and scenic observation. Some phrasing ("uncommonly thoughtful nature, a mirror to Kael's") tells rather than shows, and a few filter verbs ("felt," "knew") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("merrily melancholic," "rusted sentinels," "flickering faith"). Perceptual signature is present: Elias notices nautical and navigational detail (dead reckoning, crossbars, transformer hum). However, several phrases drift into elevated, slightly abstract register ("backlash of regrets," "strange gravity of forgiveness," "bearing" used in the final line) that feel more thematic than character-specific under peak stress. Free indirect style is clean, but the density of metaphoric phrasing in high-pressure beats (fog sequence, compass release) occasionally dulls immediacy. No dialogue present; n/a for dialogue bullets.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, anchoring in Kael's perception throughout. Diction remains consistent—no register jumps—but voice is generic: "jaded wonder," "delicately robust," "weary expression tinged with hope" (lines 13, 14, 25, 32) are stock literary phrases without character-particular syntax or rhythm. Under peak stress (cavern trembling, lines 23–24) the prose does not compress or fragment; sentence structure remains uniform. Perceptual signature is absent—Kael's way of noticing (algae, crystals, steel towers) reads like neutral camera work rather than a mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the narrator's distance is controlled. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("cosmic intimacy," "reluctant metamorphosis," "paradoxically steady") that clashes with the immediacy of transformation under duress. Perceptual signature is generic: the whisperer's noticing lacks character-specific bias or selectivity. The prose often asserts emotional states ("tears fell from her now-bestial eyes, each drop a tiny moon") rather than filtering them through embodied perception. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is ornate and consistent, with a perceptual signature (onyx-ink, porcelain, mist) that suits the cartomancer's ritualistic lens. However, register drifts into abstraction under pressure: "cloudbound repentance," "luminous burden," "repository of stolen moments" inflate diction without grounding in tactile action. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose performs lyricism rather than embodying the character's lived urgency; the cartomancer observes her transformation as spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Maya's AI consciousness. The diction modulates effectively between technical precision ("monofilament spun from the ship's decaying warp core") and lyric compression ("stars hung like unanswered prayers"). One dialogue beat ("I'm sorry") lands with earned simplicity. Weakness: elevated poetic register occasionally clashes with the mechanical focalization ("grief itself," "mercy's example"), and a few filter verbs dilute immediacy in peak beats without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; psychic distance is controlled and the narrative voice carries distinct lyric texture ("sandals whispered," "hush that vibrated with subsonic thunder"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Kael notices light, rhythm, causality—though under peak pressure the prose remains lush rather than compressing to match urgency. Free indirect style is clean. However, phrases like "the weight of realization settling into his bones" and "carving him hollow so he could be filled with this moment" drift toward poeticized abstraction that slightly undermines embodied immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Seren's professional lens—she notices lock mechanisms, gear ratios, coded angles. Perceptual signature is consistent: "oiling a lock that would never close again" reflects her occupational identity. Diction remains controlled, though occasional phrases ("luminous promise," "midwife") drift slightly elevated. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. The prose modulates with urgency: crisp action during the lock-picking, more reflective during the final dawn wait. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under pressure. Purposeful compression in the climactic sequence maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited, stable POV throughout. Diction trends elevated ("blackened spine," "borrowed dawn," "fragments of glass") but remains internally consistent. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is vague: we learn Elara notices patterns but not how her precognitive mind distinctively filters stimuli under stress. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs ("believed," "realized," "understood") cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation, dulling immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent lyric register ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder," "rarefied air") create a coherent narrative voice. Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, appropriate for the poet focalizer. Minor issues: some filter verbs ("he felt his own mask slip," "he could almost hear") dull immediacy in peak moments, and a few phrases ("the timer's steady tick was the only clock in a vigil that had paused the world") edge toward over-elaboration. The voice is distinct but occasionally tips into abstraction under pressure rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature exists—focus on coded patterns, mechanical arm details—but diction remains generic and interchangeable across beats, lacking the idiosyncratic texture required for high scores. Peak moments default to stock phrasing: "restless moment," "shadow of a smile," "silent applause of the brook." Purposeful elision of the actual mechanics of decoding and the duel's intellectual parry-and-thrust creates a distance that flattens immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Narrative stance is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited to the poet; psychic distance remains consistent. Perceptual signature is visible in "luminous fracture," "blooming resistance," and poetic diction ("silver ribbons," "cathedral"), though these recur as ornament rather than stress-responsive modulation. Diction stays within a lyric register but flattens under pressure: "heart swelled" and "hands shake" lack character-particular syntax. No dialogue on the page (Cora and the poet "spoke in shorthand, trading titles" is summary). The molt mechanism is told rather than shown through shifts in sentence rhythm or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (music-theory diction, atmospheric attunement). The prose modulates from thin urgency at the station to velvet stillness at the arbor, fitting the emotional arc. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("a living cradle above the clouds," "the promise of another encore") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-close on Kael; focalization is controlled. Diction is mostly consistent—scientific register ("spectrograph," "matrices," "frequency of doubt") mixed with lyric compression ("storm-cloud leather," "memory-light," "mycelium"). Some constructions feel artificially elevated for the moment's needs: "photon a story," "cartography of luminous doubt." The perceptual signature (checker measuring magic) is clear, but voice occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("questions without answers," "breathing beneath the stone") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (grief-colored noticing: "cerulean regret," sea-glass metaphors). Hideo's dialogue carries distinct rhythm ("cannot be forced; they must be diffused through ritual") but Mara's speech is absent, limiting voice distinction test. The time-compression across three seasons maintains narrative stance without head-hopping. Diction stays within contemplative register though "rhythmically placid" as descriptor appears repeatedly without varying the phrasing, creating minor template echo.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and convincing for a neutron star researcher: technical diction (“spectral patterns,” “decay curves,” “pulsar data”) sits naturally alongside lyric description. Sentences vary rhythmically, and the narrative stance maintains a clear, single focalizer without leakage. At times the register tilts into reflective essay (“the humble truth that everything changes”), which slightly flattens the otherwise strong character-specific texture. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and mostly well-matched to a reflective, art-focused protagonist. Repeated phrases and structures (“quiet canyon under stars,” “drifting resonance,” “beacon of truth”) sometimes edge toward generic poeticism but don’t break POV. There’s a distinct textural interest in light, pattern, and sound that gives the narration some character-specific flavor. More variation in rhythm and fewer stock abstractions would sharpen its distinctiveness at a high-literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-close voice is steady, lyrical, and coherent with Mara’s inward, sensory-turning attention; the “heat-mapping emotions” conceit gives it a distinctive perceptual signature. Rhythm is controlled, with recurring phrases functioning as motif rather than mechanical repetition. At times the narration drifts into abstract or summarizing registers (“a language, a way to translate silence into shared feeling”) that feel more authorial than truly character-bound. Still, POV control is clean, and the style suits the accumulative, meditative design.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent, character-inflected diction—images like “hands were permanent wrinkles of silt and sorrow” feel organic to this undertaker’s perception. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose alive while sustaining a somber, pressurized tone. The narrative distance stays stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or register jolts; the occasional elevated abstraction (“Conceptual repricing” style language is avoided) doesn’t undercut voice. Compression and summary are well-judged for this length, with no expository over-explaining of what the images already convey.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-controlled, with a consistent vantage anchored mostly in Mara and the community’s collective experience. Syntax is varied enough to avoid monotony, and the pattern of quiet observation suits the tone. There is some distance and generality in diction that flattens individual perspective, especially at emotional peaks, but no serious POV leakage or mechanical issues. The voice is pleasant and competent, if not yet distinctive at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture and patterned diction that suits the meditative, mystical frame. Imagery and syntax are controlled—breath, fog, light, and rails recur in a deliberate rhythm that feels intentional rather than random. At times the narration sounds more like an omniscient lyric essay than a mind-specific voice, but the stance doesn’t slip or contradict itself. There is no dialogue to test range, yet the narrative perspective remains steady and emotionally attuned throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a clear perceptual signature—mathematical metaphors, botanical specificity, and temporal imagery consistently color the narration. Distance is stable and suited to the mythic, conceptual register, and the patterned diction (“texture of time,” “hyperbolic,” “fading photographs”) teaches its own logic early. There’s no head-hopping or muddled stance despite the abstract subject matter. At times the elevated register risks slight uniformity of tone, but it remains controlled and appropriate to the piece’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable and confident, with a consistent lyric texture that suits the fable-like premise. Metaphoric constructions such as “his heart a compass, his chains a map” and “a green rebellion against the arid silence” give the narration a recognizable cadence. Psychic distance is fairly steady; we hover just outside his mind without intrusive authorial explanation or head-hopping. At times the poetic register feels generalized rather than sharply character-specific, which slightly blunts distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture aligned with Lyra’s synesthetic perception, with strong patterning around sound, color, and absence. POV distance stays consistent; we never slip out of Lyra’s interpretive frame, and the narration’s elevated diction feels justified by her sensibility and the speculative setting. Rhythm modulates effectively, tightening around the forge’s reignition and relaxing into broader reflection elsewhere. Occasional explanatory lines about theme and function (e.g., defining the greenhouse as a “hearing aid for the planet”) slightly blunt the otherwise precise voice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and consistently lyrical, with a strong preference for luminous, quasi-mystical diction that suits the conceit. Phrases like “a shadow stitched with light” and “luminous disbelief” provide a recognizable texture, and focalization doesn’t slip. At times the register becomes repetitively elevated and homogeneous across beats, blunting modulation between quiet and climactic moments. Nonetheless, the POV is clear and reliable, and the pattern it teaches is maintained through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Marek’s craftsman sensibility; phrases like “transparent witness” and “ordinary alchemy” feel like his texture of mind. POV control is steady with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance moves smoothly between sensory observation and interior reflection. The rhetorical, semi-mocking narration to the machines and later to the sparrows adds a distinctive tonal signature without breaking realism. Elevated diction is consistent with the contemplative, literary register and doesn’t feel like external authorial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lexicon and sensory focus that matches Mira’s heightened fear and attentiveness. Prose rhythm varies reasonably, and the narrative doesn’t slip into unjustified omniscience or head-hopping. Some phrasing leans toward generalized abstraction or thesis-speak, especially around theme, but most of the diction stays grounded in concrete perception. There’s a distinct, if not highly idiosyncratic, perceptual signature in how she notices rungs, currents, and structural sounds.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and consistent with the story’s meditative aim, with pleasing motifs (“marbled hush,” “ambered hush,” “constellation of quiet”). Repetition creates a recognizable texture and supports the accumulative design. At times the diction flattens into incantatory sameness, with many sentences carrying similar cadence and abstracted phrasing. Still, there is no head-hopping, register drift, or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice anchored in J-3 is stable, with a cool, precise lexicon that fits a sentient machine while still allowing for lyricism. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, and the voice modulates appropriately as reality destabilizes without losing clarity. Filtered perception (“sensors registering,” “processors began to amalgamate”) feels voice-true rather than distancing. At times, the narrative idiom slips toward human-philosophical register rather than fully committing to a distinctively machinic perceptual signature, limiting its distinctiveness at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close POV is stable and appropriate, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is clear, mildly lyrical, and consistent, but not particularly distinctive or idiosyncratic to Elara beyond her role as registrar. Some phrasing (“resonant hush,” “quiet freedom”) feels generic rather than deeply character-specific. Overall, it’s controlled and readable but not yet memorable at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently archaic, and mostly well-suited to a fable-like piece about an aging gardener and luck. Diction choices like “wisely pragmatic,” “blooming withering,” and “mended deception” give it a distinct texture, even if they veer toward self-conscious repetition. Dialogue is somewhat formal and thematic but legible and consistent with the quasi-mythic tone. Overall, the POV control is solid, though the voice doesn’t quite achieve the sharp distinctiveness or modulation under pressure that would push it into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, mixing technical diction with lush, image-rich description in a way that suits Kael’s mechanic-mystic sensibility. POV remains stable and believable; we never slip into knowledge beyond her observational and inferential reach. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with Chen’s brusque line contrasting Kael’s cooler, more lyrical interiority. Rhythmic variation and sentence-level texture show a confident prose stance suitable for high-end literary SF markets.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a musician in a haunted opera house, with recurring phrases (“wordless conversation,” “hush of unstruck chords”) building a coherent texture. The diction and imagery feel controlled rather than florid, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Musical and theatrical metaphors suit the POV and situation. A bit more idiosyncratic, character-specific phrasing would further distinguish Mara’s inner lens from a generic literary-lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with the oracle’s sensibility, with a consistent lexicon that plausibly fits a reflective scientist-mystic. Repetition of key phrases and motifs builds a deliberate chant-like rhythm that suits the accumulative design. At times, though, the prose edges toward sameness in cadence and relies on similar constructions to restate insights, softening impact. Sharper modulation—occasional syntactic or tonal breaks at key turns—would better mirror the shifts in her internal weather.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture—industrial, tactile, slightly hallucinatory—that matches Elias’s sleepless, skeptical-yet-haunted consciousness. Diction choices like “religiously skeptical,” “ghost shift,” and “weave of eternity” feel of a piece and avoid register clashes. Psychic distance is well modulated, tightening at key actions (turning the wheel, stepping through the door) and relaxing for brief reflective spans without losing immediacy. The only drawback is occasional thematic over-articulation via the radio that edges toward authorial rather than strictly character-bound voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and lyrically controlled, with a distinct preference for slow, meditative cadence and recurring key phrases (“drift of untold seasons,” “regenerative silence,” “crumbling peace”). Diction is consistent with the mythic, contemplative tone and doesn’t break POV plausibility. At times, the rhythm risks sameness and abstraction, but the piece maintains clarity and emotional orientation throughout. No head-hopping or stance confusion occurs, and the final paragraphs modulate into a softer, more resolved cadence effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to Mira’s sensibility, with phrases like “measured time in breaths rather than minutes” and “key turning in a lock it was born to fit” establishing a distinct texture. Psychic distance is controlled, sliding smoothly between external detail and interior perception without confusion or head-hopping. The register is elevated but fits the quasi-mystical tone of the piece and remains legible. It stops short of the very top band because a few thematic sentences read more like authorial summary than Mira-filtered thought, softening the otherwise sharp perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual filter through Elias’s sensibility. Diction (“bronze cylinder,” “contained memory,” “axis had tilted seven degrees and scraped away the sky’s familiar constellations”) feels unified and deliberate, matching the speculative-literary register. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the narrative comfortably sustains a reflective, essayistic distance suited to an accumulative concept piece. At times the exposition edges toward telling, but it remains in keeping with the chosen mode rather than a breach of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture, with striking but controlled metaphors (“like a finger pointing at guilty stars,” “a heartbeat of glass and brass”). Diction and syntax are consistent with a literary but not omniscient stance, and interior access feels coherent and character-colored. The narrative modulates rhythm well—denser when conceptual (seeing the “matrix”), lighter and more concrete when following the fortunes’ outcomes. There’s no head-hopping or register slippage; the voice holds confidently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a clear perceptual signature: it blends close access to Miriam’s tactics with an almost-liturgical omniscience that suits the metaphysical setting. Syntax and rhythm are varied and intentionally patterned, supporting the pressure instead of blurring it. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and the questions themselves function as both speech and spell. The slightly elevated register feels earned for a cloistered, mystical context and does not break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong preference for image-driven, metaphor-rich sentences that suit the surreal premise. The perceptual signature—obsessed with sound, reflection, geometry, and time—is distinctive and stable. Rhythm generally breathes well across the piece, modulating at the musical climax. Some phrasing and repeated constructions in the final third (“upturned hush,” mirrored horizon, conductor motif) verge on self-echo, but they stop short of real voice fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and suitably elevated for the metaphysical subject matter, with consistent diction around physics, time, and consciousness. Recurrent phrasing ("between the drop and the ripple," "procedural generation") reads as intentional motif rather than scaffolding, and rhythm is generally well managed. At times the register veers toward generalized philosophic abstraction, blurring the character’s perceptual specificity into a more authorial voice. Nonetheless, the lyric mode is coherent, and the narrative stance holds cleanly to her lens without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and well-matched to the material, with recurring phrases (“filament of hush,” “mirrored hush”) creating a deliberate incantatory effect. Psychic distance stays fairly tight to Elara while allowing a quiet, fable-like narration that feels intentional rather than generic. There is no head-hopping, and the drum maker’s presence is handled cleanly without intrusive explanation. At times the cadence and diction risk sameness, but overall the voice feels deliberate and distinctive rather than template-like.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits a meticulous observer cataloging both weather and danger. Diction is controlled and consistent, with no POV-breaking register shifts or head-hopping. Repeated structures (“layered tranquility,” integrity language) verge on pattern rather than true redundancy, but they slightly dilute distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is polished and appropriate, if a bit uniform emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a character for whom light and scent are professional and emotional lexicons. The diction (“aromatically cautious,” “compressed elegy,” “crystal shadows”) fits the heightened, almost speculative-literary register and stays internally coherent. Rhythm modulates effectively, with long, sensuous sentences for atmosphere and slightly punchier lines at emotional peaks (“She was ready to carry it.”). There is some repeat in imagery and phrasing, but it reads as intentional motif rather than uncontrolled drift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close-third, lyrical voice is stable and fitting for a contemplative poet, with a consistent lexicon and cadence that suits the metaphysical focus. The diction (“ethically playful,” “passionate subtlety”) is elevated but coherent with the character’s introspective, poetic frame. There are no POV slips, and the narrative distance stays comfortably close. Some rhythmic and syntactic variety prevents it from becoming fully monotonous, though the voice leans toward uniform solemnity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a clear sensory bias toward sound that suits an “acoustically perceptive” protagonist. Rhythm and syntax are mostly well-controlled, even if sentence openings (“She…”, “The…”) become somewhat repetitive. There’s a consistent, slightly incantatory narrative stance that matches the ritual frame and never slips into awkward register. The voice feels unified and apt for the story’s ambitions, if not yet dazzlingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The first-person voice is steady, precise, and distinct: clinical yet sensuous, with a convincing professional lexicon around scent and static. Psychic distance is well-managed, keeping close to immediate perceptions while allowing occasional reflective breadth. There are some rhythmic and phrasing repetitions (especially around “half truths” and “fuse insight with empathy”) that dull the impact slightly. Overall, though, the POV is controlled and coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and readable, with a consistent gentle, slightly lyrical cadence that suits the setting. Diction is generally appropriate, but recurrent phrases (“cycles of compassion,” “cautious exuberance,” “breezy library under stars”) give the narration a templated feel rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. There is little modulation in rhythm or texture when the emotional stakes rise (Caleb’s revelation, the ceremony), so peaks don’t feel stylistically intensified. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for premier literary placement.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a strong, consistent texture of invented myth and precise imagery (“trees humming in frequencies beyond the murmur of lost languages”). The focalization stays largely with Kael, with occasional omniscient tilts that suit the fable-like register rather than confusing perspective. Diction and rhythm are confident and varied, though at times the narration feels more authorial than tightly bound to Kael’s individual thought-patterns. Even so, the voice remains distinctive and coherent through shifts in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled, image-rich sentences that match the fantastical premise and maintain a stable third-person focus through Elara. The diction and rhythm feel deliberate and patterned rather than generic, and the mythic distance suits the accumulative, fable-like structure. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the occasional elevated abstraction fits the quasi-mythic register. The one tradeoff is that this lyricism sometimes keeps us at a slight remove from raw, messy subjectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with controlled rhythm and a distinct, gently incantatory texture. Diction choices like “mathematics of emotion” and “fractals of grief and hope” feel thematically motivated rather than random ornament. There are no POV slips or distance confusions, and the narrative modulation from hush to humming orchard is smooth. At times the register edges toward generalized “poetic” rather than sharply character-specific, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice on Mara is consistent and distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in touch and infrastructure (“Her hands remembered every rivet”). Lyric diction like “sapphire-hush moments” and “the kindly methodical” is controlled and feels true to a character who lives in attention to texture and structure. Psychic distance is well managed, sliding between concrete action in the chases and brief interior reflections without confusion. With no dialogue to test multi-voice contrast, this still reads as a confident, unified narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, gently lyrical, and well-suited to a contemplative, nature-focused piece. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with recurring phrasing (“circuitously sincere,” “reluctant metamorphosis”) that, while a bit self-conscious, does build a recognizable texture. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and focalization stays plausibly within Elena’s sensibility. The main limit is that the voice, though polished, doesn’t yet feel idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable among top-tier literary nature pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a recognizable cadence and sensory bias (water, stone, texture) that fits the character and world. Diction is mostly controlled and avoids jarring register shifts, and the narrative distance stays stable. Reused phrases (“haggard awe,” “thresh meaning”) start to feel like visible seams rather than deliberate refrains, nudging the piece toward self-consciousness. Still, the voice carries the story’s mood with confidence and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice centered on Lira is mostly consistent and suitably lyrical, with controlled repetition of key phrases (“bright darkness,” “overlapping shadows”) creating a recognizable texture. Occasional omniscient touches (the pilgrim’s “silent purpose fulfilled”) expand perspective but do not confuse the lens. Diction is elevated yet coherent with the mystical setting, and sentence rhythms are varied enough to avoid monotony. The voice is distinctive but could use a few more character-specific perceptions to feel wholly Lira-shaped rather than generally poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture (nautical and archival lexis, rhythmic sentences) that matches the archivist’s sensibility. POV distance is stable: we stay in her conceptual and sensory frame without head-hopping, and moments of summarizing are smoothly integrated. The voice modulates gently toward greater solemnity and expansiveness as the implications of her work emerge, which suits an accumulative design. A slight tendency to abstract phrasing in places doesn’t fracture the voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technical mapping language and lush, artistic metaphor. The narrative distance is steady and appropriate; we never slip into knowledge Elara cannot have. Rhythms modulate well between long, sensuous sentences and slightly tighter ones at decision points, keeping the lyricism from turning monotonous. There is no dialogue to test, but the internal voice itself carries personality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the meditative, speculative tone. Diction is consistent with Lira’s reflective stance, and the narrator does not head-hop or break focalization. Rhythms and sentence structures are reasonably varied, though they lean toward a uniform, flowing cadence that sometimes blurs intensity levels. There is little dialogue to test character-voice distinction, but the narrative stance remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and confidently blends scientific and mythic registers in a way that feels like an extension of Althea’s vast perspective. Phrases like “a diplomat from the kingdom of endless time to the insurgency of finite space” signal a clear, distinctive narrative idiom. Distance control is stable; we never slip into other minds or out of her frame. The main limitation is that the sustained high-register lyricism occasionally blurs emotional immediacy, keeping this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive analytic-lyric texture, marrying Sam’s mathematical mindset with the macabre environment (“a breach of pure geometry,” “ethical algebra”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, with line-level variation that keeps the prose from feeling mechanical. The register is elevated for a 14-year-old focalizer but reads as a stable narrative stance rather than unmotivated drift. Dialogue is sparse yet goal-driven and subtextual, especially in the brief negotiation with the director.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and cohesive, with a clear perceptual bias toward light, sound, and material textures (“metal thin as breath,” “electric dawn”). Diction and rhythm support the contemplative, meticulous mindset and rarely wobble in register. However, the lyrical narrative texture feels more generically “poetic” than strictly individualized; another character with similar sensibility could plausibly speak in the same idiom. Minor syntactic repetition (“Each…”, “She…”) sometimes flattens cadence under what should be peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the survivor’s odd, liminal consciousness—bureaucratic bureaucracy (“typo in a database”) and sensory surrealism (“colors bleed at the edges”) coexist without clash. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences carry a consistent, slightly incantatory cadence that suits the accumulative structure. POV distance is well handled—close enough to feel his obsessions, but wide enough for conceptual framing. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates appropriately as the box gains weight and significance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong, recognizable texture—metaphors like the rusted dome as a broken skull and the shell as a second heart feel organic to this consciousness. Diction and rhythm hold steady without register slips or head-hopping, and the narrative calmly sustains its metaphysical focus. Psychic distance is controlled: we hover near Elias’s perceptions without omniscient leakage. At times the voice leans into abstraction, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly aligned with Mira’s perceptions, with recurring turns of phrase that feel deliberate rather than generic. The diction is mostly consistent with the world and focalization, balancing poetic description (“blackwater like fireflies on a liquid sky”) with clear narrative exposition. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctiveness, but the narrative voice itself has a recognizable texture and cadence. Occasional abstract formulations (“hopeful desperation”) slightly flatten otherwise strong specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable and unobtrusively handled, with the narrative lens consistently tied to her perceptions and concerns. Diction is lyrically elevated but generally coherent for the frame, and psychic distance remains steady. The voice is competent and occasionally striking (“a silence that seemed to hold its breath”) but not strongly idiosyncratic; it could belong to many SF-lyric narrators. Mild repetition of constructions (“She [verb]…”) and favored phrases keeps it from feeling truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet anchored in Miren’s sensory reality, with a distinct perceptual signature (vibration, temperature, and light behavior instead of sight). Diction and rhythm are controlled; long, flowing sentences suit the meditative tone but are punctuated by tighter beats around technical actions. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Miren and Kael’s few lines are differentiated in status and intent. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains stable and apt for this quiet, craft-centered story.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility as a cartographer and water-listener, with distinctive phrases like “a dark comma against the white page of sky” and “water always wrote its own cartography.” The narrative distance modulates well, moving between image-rich description and mythic pronouncement without losing coherence. There’s no head-hopping, and the single line of dialogue fits his dry-witted characterization. Occasionally the voice drifts toward generalized maxim (“The phrasebook had taught him translation was just listening with different ears”), but it stays largely in character and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong rhythmic control (“the hush of a forest before storm, of a held breath before song”) that suits the sonic motif. Third-person focalization stays stable around Kael while allowing a mythic, slightly omniscient distance without confusion. The diction and metaphor field (sound, breath, memory, stone) are coherently maintained and feel like a single sensibility. It verges on uniformly elevated, but that grandness fits the timeless, ritualistic frame rather than reading as register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third on Lira, then zoom-out to the captain, is cleanly segmented and maintains a coherent, mildly elevated lyrical voice. Diction (“gathered hush,” “lonesome splendor”) is distinctive yet consistent with the speculative-literary mode. The narrative confidently reports only what each focal lens can know, with the captain’s “understood, without understanding” nicely calibrating his distance from Lira’s experience. A touch of omniscient-poetic commentary in the final paragraphs is noticeable but not so intrusive as to disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and recognizably its own, with patterned phrases like “copperlight repose” and “chasing hush” creating a distinct texture. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with the fable-like, gothic register of the piece. The psychic distance remains stable; we stay close enough to the son’s perspective to follow his intentions, with no head-hopping or stance drift. At times the lyricism smooths over concrete perception or stress, slightly flattening immediacy, but the tonal control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the Gothic-fantastical material, with recurring phrasing (“hush of winter-cracked fields,” “lovingly venomous whisper”) building a deliberate cadence. POV is stable and free of head-hopping; we never leave Elara’s experiential frame. Rhythm and diction vary enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a spell-like tone. The main limit is that the voice, while polished, doesn’t yet feel sharply idiosyncratic to Elara as a character rather than to the genre mood.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, with consistent diction and a clear aesthetic—elevated but not incoherent. Recurring phrasing (“ruin,” “reverence,” “orchid solace,” “ghost-light”) builds a recognizable texture, though at times it skirts repetition. POV distance remains steady and omniscient-leaning without head-hopping, fitting the fable-like tone. The voice is pleasing and controlled but not yet singular enough in rhythm or idiosyncrasy to feel unmistakably distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Lina reads bones, roots, and light. Diction is elevated but believable for this focalizer, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping or awkward register shifts. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, though some constructions (“quiet promise,” “quiet reassurance,” “quiet smile”) verge on patterned safety. Overall the voice is polished and confident, suitable for an elite literary context.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature—lyric, slightly ceremonious, and aligned with Kael’s artisanal, quasi-religious regard for their work. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring cadences that support the meditative tone without fully slipping into monotony. Dialogue is sparse but effective, distinguishing Mira from Kael and carrying thematic subtext in just a few lines. Occasionally, the register edges toward abstract phrasing (“carefully inventive architecture of their code”), but it remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third lyric voice is stable, with a distinct texture built from quiet, patient rhythms and recurring motifs of silence, light, and thread. Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mystical setting and Mira’s contemplative mindset, and the pattern of figurative language is taught early and maintained. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates subtly as urgency rises (after the prophecy line and the candle’s signal). It’s not stylistically radical, but it is controlled and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is lyrically charged but coherent, with a strong perceptual signature (“wind chimes made of broken glass and memory,” “turns wounds into whispers”). Distance and tense stay stable, and the mind on the page feels plausibly the same throughout, modulating intensity rather than register. There’s no dialogue to test, but narrative rhythm and diction adjust well at peak moments—shorter, more forceful lines around the apology itself. Occasional repetition of key phrases (“fierce tenderness”) reads as intentional motif rather than tic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and clearly stamped by Kael’s mind: metaphors of tide, coral, language, and wounds feel like a translator’s and ex-fieldworker’s way of seeing. Rhythm and syntax modulate smoothly, with long, sinuous sentences fitting the drugged, drifting consciousness while remaining legible. Diction is elevated but plausibly within this character’s lexicon and stays consistent; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice maintains a distinct texture under emotional pressure without lapsing into generic “literary” mush.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately attuned to an artist’s perceptions, with recurring attention to light, texture, and image. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the diction generally fits both the speculative setting and Lyra’s sensibility. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the slight distance allows for a gentle, reflective tone. A few phrases slide toward generic “literary” abstraction, but they don’t seriously erode the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits Elena’s sensibility and the surreal garden. Repetition of phrases like “pause between question and reply” functions as a deliberate motif rather than an accident, helping teach the pattern and support the accumulative lens. There is minimal dialogue, but the slight tonal shift around the visitor’s question and laugh is handled smoothly. At times the narrator slides toward abstract, essay-like formulations that feel more authorial than character-bound, which slightly dilutes the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, blending Aris’s academic precision with a slightly baroque lyricism (e.g., “cathedral of controlled chaos”) in a way that feels character-appropriate. Dialogue is goal-driven and subtextual—Aris and Chen speak in double-coded remarks that both serve plot and embody their shared risk. POV control is stable with no head-hopping; the narrative never claims knowledge beyond Aris’s plausible inference. A few elevated phrasings (“candidly cryptic observation”) brush up against self-consciousness but mostly support the cultivated, etymologist-professor sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with distinctive diction (“reef-shadow joy,” “photosynthesize pain into beauty”) and a stable, gently elevated register that suits the mythic frame. Repetition of key phrases feels mostly patterned rather than accidental and helps teach the accumulative mode. There is good control of distance, staying close enough to her sensibility without overt authorial intrusion. Some recurring constructions risk mild monotony, but they don’t undermine clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly committed to a specific register; phrases like “cathedral of translucent shelves” and “foxglove regret” establish a recognizable texture. The patterned repetition (“gentle systematic,” “opal library above clouds,” “sound of forgotten names”) feels mostly intentional as incantatory motif rather than careless redundancy. There’s no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts; the narration stays close enough to Lyra to feel anchored. The risk is a certain sameness of cadence that can dull impact over time, but it does not seriously obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical without losing clarity, and convincingly colored by an arcane linguist’s sensibility—metaphors tend toward linguistic and archival imagery. Sentence rhythm is varied and generally well-controlled, with a clear build toward the reconciliation scene. Dialogue is sparse but functional and emotionally grounded; Kess’s confession compresses backstory efficiently while advancing the emotional turn. Occasionally the narration edges into generalized summary (“cautious exuberance,” “carefully reckless gamble”) where a bit more sensory or idiosyncratic framing might sharpen the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism, with recurring motifs (breath, stone, chain, heartbeat) that feel intentional and mostly well-paced. Focalization around Alia is stable and credible; we never slip into others’ interiors, and the narrative certainty matches what she could plausibly infer. The elevated diction suits the quasi-mythic, fable-like tone of the piece, even if at times it edges toward abstraction. There’s good rhythmic variation in sentence structure, and the prose modulates appropriately between description and narrational summary.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with a stable psychic distance. Rhythms and diction suit a reflective, gently fantastical literary mode and rarely break register. There is some syntactic sameness and mantra-like repetition of phrases (“echo of lost songs,” “paper trail”) that can feel more like scaffolding than deliberate incantation. Still, the perceptual signature—attuned to dust, song, and fragile objects—reads distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and suits the contemplative, surreal mode; phrases like “featherly determined” and “fractured hush” give it a recognizable texture. POV control is clean and stable, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience. Some diction and rhythm become repetitive across sentences, which slightly flattens dynamic modulation. Overall the voice is pleasant and distinct enough for publication-level consideration but not yet exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (cosmic metaphors, urban constellations, resonance language). Orpheus’ few lines feel texturally different—tidal, resigned—which helps define their relationship and status. Diction sometimes leans into elevated abstraction, but it mostly matches Iyana’s esoteric, pattern-obsessed mind and remains legible. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough to her perceptions to keep the lyricism grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits the fable-like, speculative mode (“the earth’s glittering throat,” “symphony of colors”). The narrative distance stays stable and modestly close to Lira’s perceptions without head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the diction feels coherent across the piece. Occasionally the voice leans into generalized explanation of theme, but not so much as to break its textured, confident feel.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—phrases like “arithmetic of wonder” and “calculated wilderness” clearly belong to this narrator/Ezra blend. The narrative distance stays stable, never leaking into omniscience beyond what fits the quasi-mythic tone, and the sparse dialogue sounds natural and in-character. Repetition of key phrases (“lightly attentive”) reads as motif rather than crutch. This is a strong, polished voice; a touch more idiosyncratic interiority under peak beats could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    The omniscient-lyric voice is consistent, with striking phrases (“obsidian grace,” “language of the void”) and a clear rhythmic pattern that suits the mythic tone. POV stance stays stable and legible; there is no head-hopping or register collapse. That said, the diction sometimes tilts into slogan-like abstraction, softening the sense of a truly singular consciousness perceiving these events. Strong but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular among top-tier literary voices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward light, surfaces, and subtle shifts. Diction is elevated but generally suits a meditative, reflective craftsman; the patterned phrases (“noctilucent reckonings,” “reads between lines,” “clear complexity”) create a recognizable texture. At times, the register feels more like abstract essay than character-particular thought, slightly distancing us from him as a concrete person. Still, the POV control is clean and the voice is distinct enough to be memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in a firefighter’s way of seeing (fire’s “language,” burn patterns, forest warnings). Syntax and rhythm modulate appropriately between reflective and present-tense ritual beats, and there is no POV leakage or stance confusion. Diction is elevated but coherent with a reflective, educated, traumatized professional; it feels like one sustained mind. A few lines flirt with generic poeticism, yet overall the voice remains distinctive and sure-footed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, with a distinctive blend of scientific and oceanic diction that matches a “logical dreamer” focalizer. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, giving the prose an almost essayistic music without losing narrative clarity. There’s no head-hopping or unexplained stance shift; the limited omniscience about the seventeen worlds is clearly framed as a function of her experimental reach. Occasional high-register abstractions skirt didacticism, but they fit the established voice rather than reading as foreign intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Mira’s professional and sensory bias, yielding a distinctive perceptual signature. Diction is largely consistent and apt for both the character and speculative-literary aims, with nice rhythmic variety. Some repeated phrases (“sensitively perceptive,” “through the half-burned diaries, she glimpsed”) and slightly generic abstractions in later thematic statements keep the voice from feeling razor-honed at the highest level. Overall, though, POV control and tonal consistency are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the ritual nature of the scene. POV distance is stable and appropriate, maintaining a slightly mythic remove while still following the painter’s focus. Patterned phrasing (“dusky harmony,” mirrors remembering, prisms after rain) feels intentional rather than sloppy, though at times it edges toward sameness. Overall, the voice is distinctive and coherent, even if it doesn’t quite push into formally daring territory.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, elevated, and lyrically inclined, establishing a clear contemplative stance from start to finish. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent; there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. However, the narrative sound is more generically “mythic-philosophical” than specifically tethered to this negotiator’s psyche, which keeps it from feeling fully singular. The lack of dialogue also reduces opportunities for sharper, character-specific voice contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and maintains a stable distance, slipping only lightly toward omniscience when discussing public legend and PR. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate and suited to the elevated, meditative tone of the piece. There is some recurrence of phrasing and abstract language, but it doesn’t significantly blur perspective or undermine control. Overall, the voice has a distinct texture even if it stops short of being singularly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture that feels tailored to Elara’s aesthetic, ritualized world. Phrasing like “snowflakes fell like forgotten syllables” and “her footsteps silent as memory” demonstrates a coherent perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays stable and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidently inhabits a close-yet-lyrical mode. A few formulations edge into abstract or repetitive diction (“bodily poetic nature,” repeated “alarming serenity”), but they don’t materially harm voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“their fury still smoking in the corners like spent cordite,” “meteor hush”). It balances omniscient sweep with close attention to Adrian and the patrons’ inner turns without head-hopping confusion. Rhythms vary and diction feels purposefully elevated in a way that suits the slightly surreal, conceptual frame. A few lines verge on self-conscious flourish, but overall control and distinctiveness are high.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical register that matches Esme’s esoteric, ritualistic worldview. Diction (“syntax of absence,” “interrupted cadence,” “transiently rooted”) feels like an extension of her mind rather than an imposed essayistic voice. The narrative maintains stable focalization without head-hopping and modulates rhythm effectively between longer, meditative sentences and sharper, charged images at key turns (the moth wing, the monarch’s appearance). A few abstract formulations flirt with over-elevation but remain coherent with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with recurring phrases (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor”) creating a recognizable texture and psychic distance appropriate to a solitary, reflective protagonist. The narrative diction (e.g., talk of phonemes, transcribed memory, foundry metaphors) feels aligned with her craft and preoccupations. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and shifts in intensity at key beats are handled smoothly. Occasionally the lyric register approaches purple, but it remains controlled and coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s reflective, pattern-fixated mind; phrases like “foresight only through hindsight” and “precisely playful” build a distinct texture. Psychic distance stays steady in a close third, with no head-hopping or stance confusion despite the dream sequences. Rhythm and diction mostly modulate well with pressure, and the voice never collapses into generic genre-speak. A few abstract formulations near the end edge toward didactic rather than fully embodied, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and well-matched to a philosophically inclined astronomer in an ancient setting, with a rich but not incoherent lexicon (“numerological devotions,” “schematic essence,” “conceptual repricing” by implication). Sentences carry a deliberate rhythm—long, braided, syntactically varied—that suits the meditative, accumulative mode. The narrative keeps a stable distance, allowing both close access to Kael’s reasoning and a slightly elevated, almost historiographic vantage that supports the thematic ambitions. At times the register edges toward uniform loftiness, which flattens contrast in peak beats, but it does not break POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent perceptual signature—phrases like “static between realities” and “encoded in the helices of her phantom DNA” feel of a piece. POV distance stays stable, with no head-hopping, and the minimal dialogue is purposeful and tonally aligned. Rhythm varies well between dense conceptual lines and more concrete motions, supporting the story’s accumulative texture. At times the register skews slightly abstract, but it remains coherent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically dense, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in glass, cold, and starlight. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a mythic, literary-fantasy register, and there is no POV leakage or confusing slippage. At times the uniform lushness flattens modulation—peaks and quieter beats can sound similar—but the pattern is taught early and sustained. Overall, the voice feels deliberate and distinctive enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly wry, and sensorially alert, matching the mender’s craft-focused perspective and temperament. Prose modulates well between descriptive lyricism and plainer narrative as needed, and the brief dialogue feels natural for a tense but intimate moment. The thematic lines spoken aloud lean a bit polished for spontaneous speech, but they remain within plausibility for a reflective craftswoman in a quiet setting. Overall, the voice feels unified and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but coherent, with a distinct blend of cosmic abstraction and tactile detail that feels particular to Evers’s fractured, hyper-attentive mind. Diction and metaphor are consistent with the premise (memorial universes, shattered symmetries, dark matter footnotes) and do not drift into alien registers. Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both sweeping conceptual vistas and intimate bodily actions like clenching the shell. The occasional near-slogan phrase (“forbidden truth, no matter the cost”) slightly flattens an otherwise very controlled voice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with recurring musical and textual metaphors (“mute chords,” “silent chorus,” “visual symphony”) building a clear perceptual signature. Syntax varies well, and the elevated diction fits the mythic-fantastical register without obvious register breaks or clunky exposition. POV distance stays stable and external; we rarely get deep interior access, but that seems an intentional, fable-like stance. A touch more modulation of rhythm during moments of danger or negotiation could sharpen urgency without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the accumulative, dreamy structure. Diction and imagery (“garden of forgotten names,” “breathing like a living archive”) feel coherent with Mira’s sensibility and the surreal setting. There are no POV slips or unjustified register jumps, and the narrative distance stays appropriately intimate. The rhythm is controlled, though occasionally the abstractions approach sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent, marrying an almost academic precision with lyric compression in a way that matches an archivist protagonist. Diction such as “semantic bomb” and “temporal ambiguity” feels like a believable extension of her mental lexicon rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance is steady—close enough for her perceptions and frameworks to dominate, without slipping into omniscient explanation. The rhythmic modulation toward the climax (as the gears stutter and histories merge) supports the pressure without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent lyric texture that suits this mythic, quasi-musical world. Phrases like “hammered repose” and “bloom of hush” give the prose a distinct sonic signature. At times, repetition of set phrases and similar rhythms risks mild monotony, but not enough to break immersion. POV boundaries are clean and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that fits the mythic, contemplative mode, with consistent diction around light, glass, and pattern. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both close interior access and broader, almost fable-like commentary without jarring shifts. The narrative certainty generally matches what she can infer, given her retrocognition. A few lines slide toward essayistic moralizing rather than staying rooted in her perception, which slightly blurs the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: stormlight as “weather’s own pulse,” forecourt whispers as “glass chimes and half-remembered lullabies,” and the moss journal exhaling “scent of thunderstorms and old ink.” Third-person close focalization remains stable and plausible for an archivist steeped in abstraction. Rhythm varies effectively, with sentence compression at key hinges and more expansive cadences for atmospheric build. Occasional aphoristic lines flirt with abstraction but remain grounded enough in her vocation and world.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled and distinct, with a strong lyric texture rooted in Cinder’s fire-and-sensation worldview. Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate well, from dense description at arrival to lighter, quicker phrasing as she departs humming a new mantra. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence matches what she can plausibly perceive. At times the elevated metaphor density brushes up against purple, but it mostly feels like a coherent stylistic choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and distinct: lyrical, image-driven, and firmly rooted in a mind that sees the world via marine and temporal metaphors. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, with a measured rhythm that fits the reflective, accumulative structure. There is no POV leakage; everything we know is plausibly through Mara’s perceptions and knowledge. The elevated register is occasionally uniform across the entire scene, but it still reads as a coherent, character-anchored narrative stance rather than generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, closely held voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly biased by the girl’s sensory preoccupations (flavors of silence, textures of air, the body as “a stretched muscle”). Diction is consistent with a slightly elevated, fable-like mode and avoids jarring register shifts. Repetition of certain constructions (“She learned…,” “She tasted…,” “The gilded hush…”) feels patterned rather than mechanical, building a chant-like rhythm that suits the concept. The lack of dialogue keeps everything interior and atmospheric, which works here but also spares the voice from having to negotiate multiple idioms under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature—Kael reads the world via color, vibration, and instrument feedback, which suits her role. Diction is mostly consistent, and the diplomat’s sparse, brusque lines contrast effectively with the more contemplative narration. Occasional abstractions (“fluidly logical argument”) brush against a slightly essayistic register, but not enough to break immersion. POV is stable, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently elevated and slightly mythic, matching the “futuristic nostalgia” tone and the archivist’s sensibility. POV is stable and confident, with no head-hopping and a clear perceptual filter tuned to artifacts, murals, and temporal devices. Occasional repeated constructions (“peel of paint layers”) and prompt-echo diction (“wisely adventurous”) make the texture feel a bit templated at moments, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the material, with patterned diction around ash, breath, thresholds, and emptiness. Psychic distance is steady; we hover near her consciousness without head-hopping, and the narrative stance feels unified. Dialogue is sparse and slightly formal, blending with the narrative register so the two speakers do not feel strongly differentiated. Still, rhythm and tone modulate appropriately with emotional beats, and the accumulative style is taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, lyrical-technical register that suits Kael’s reflective, slightly nerdy mindset. Diction (“shadowseam,” “superposition of intent,” “waveform collapsing into certainty”) creates a distinct tonal texture without losing basic clarity. Some passages slide into expository abstraction, but they still mostly feel like Kael’s conceptual framework rather than authorial intrusion. There is no head-hopping, and shifts in intensity are managed smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a clear preference for sonorous, image-heavy sentences that match the contemplative mode. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, and the modulation from room to night sky remains under one coherent focal lens. Some diction (“bridge of intuition,” “eloquent silence,” “talisman…palm of destiny”) edges toward generic lyricism, reducing the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Overall, the voice is polished and steady, if not fully singular.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a consistent, elevated, slightly archaic lyricism that suits the fable-like tone and fantastical subject. Diction (“glass cathedral of perpetual darkness,” “fluid geometry that defied logic but felt utterly true”) is controlled and felt, and the psychic distance stays stable. While strong, the voice is more generally poetic-fantasy than idiosyncratically Aldric-specific, which keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, confident, and texturally distinct, with Marianne’s way of noticing (dust, boxes, tiny artifacts) shaping the diction and metaphors. Syntax varies pleasantly, achieving a measured, contemplative rhythm suited to archival work and grief. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance remains stable and apt. A few lines verge on overtly explanatory narration, but overall the voice feels controlled and character-inflected rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled and distinct, with sharp phrasings like “rebel bureaucrats forgot to fear” and “smelled of revised histories and rotting fruit” giving it texture. The narrative distance stays stable, close enough to Mara to feel her tactics without over-explaining. Diction holds a consistent slightly-elevated, lyrical register that fits the speculative tone and doesn’t break plausibility for her perspective. A bit more modulation in rhythm around the climactic beats could further heighten pressure, but the POV control is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-closer voice is stable and suited to a lyric, incantatory mode, with consistent diction around fog, color, and hush. There’s a recognizable rhythmic signature, even if it leans heavily on similar constructions. No POV slippage or stance confusion occurs; the narrative distance stays controlled. Repetition of key phrases sometimes feels like pattern, sometimes like padding, which slightly blunts the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, with a distinct diction (“mossy delight,” “skyborne arbor,” “perpetual twilight”) that suits the fable-like mode. POV control is consistent and free of head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains appropriately close to Lira without over-explaining her thoughts. Some phrasing is repetitive, and the rhythm can feel uniformly incantatory, reducing dynamic modulation across beats. Still, the voice is coherent, recognizable, and does not obstruct comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyric, and clearly colored by a mechanically minded protagonist who nevertheless apprehends the world in metaphor. Syntax and rhythm modulate nicely between measured description and more pressured beats at the heart-clock. Diction is consistent and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“water that had forgotten its path,” “cathedral of dead leaves and glass”). There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative confidence matches what Elara can plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—lyric, slightly wry (“factually mystical”), and deeply colored by Elara’s alchemical mindset. Diction and imagery are consistent with her profession and worldview, and the narrative distance is stable, with no head-hopping. Rhythm is well controlled, modulating between dense lyricism and clearer, sharper beats at key moments (“She began to work.”). The voice feels singular and confident, supporting the story’s magical-realist register without tipping into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature that blends mythic diction and concrete specificity (“a sound like breaking glass and forgiveness”). Rhythm and syntax are varied and responsive to pressure, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift. The lyricism feels organic to the world and Kael’s role rather than grafted on. Occasional abstract formulations skim the edge of over-explaining theme, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a clear, consistent texture—dense, sensory, and analytic in ways that feel specific to Elena’s rewired, hyper-attentive body. The piece maintains a stable psychic distance and uses patterned diction (ratios, equations, data points) to support the core conceit. At times the register drifts toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains mostly plausible for a hyper-focused, mathematically minded survivor in a ritualistic setting. The voice is strong, though it could benefit from sharper modulation and a few plainer, more cutting moments under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is stable, confident, and textured, balancing sensory detail with introspection in a way that feels particular to a “between-worlds translator.” Diction and syntax maintain a lyrical but controlled register without obvious POV breaches or explanatory overreach. Rhythm varies nicely, with long, winding sentences for reflection and tighter ones at key turns (“I traced the outline, felt a latch beneath the pigment, and with a whisper-soft click the canvas swung open”). Minor repetitions of certain phrases prevent it from feeling fully razor-edged, but the overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice has a clear, controlled texture: technical, observant, and slightly haunted, matching an elevator technician with an eye for patterns. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with nice modulations between concrete occupational detail and lyric turns (“dust itself became a language”). There is mild slide into editorial abstraction near the end, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity. Overall, the perceptual signature feels distinct and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinctively lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward books, patterns, and acts of inscription that fits Elara. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and the piece teaches its ornate, conceptual style early so later flourishes feel earned. Occasional abstractions (“perfect system of weightless equilibrium,” “reality became negotiable”) remain legible and anchored but do nudge toward essayistic at times. Overall, the POV distance and texture are well controlled and suited to the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and plausibly aligned with a “poetically inclined” revolutionary; imagery choices feel like Kael’s perceptions rather than generic purple prose. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the long, ornate sentences from dragging, and POV boundaries remain clear. There is some repetition of signature phrases and emotional tags, which slightly blunts impact at times. Still, the narrative texture is distinct and controlled, especially around the storm and mirror ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct blend of mechanical precision and mystical imagery that feels specific to this repairman and his world. Diction is elevated but stable, and interior access is controlled without head-hopping or register glitches. The single line of dialogue and the covenant’s whispers fit naturally within the established tone. At peak beats the voice could risk a bit more compression or roughness to reflect stress, but overall control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, marrying scientific diction (“solution tubes,” “geological survey”) with lyric, sensory-driven phrases (“water that had forgotten the surface”). The narrative distance is stable, and the elevated register feels organic to a “sensibly eccentric” academic who catalogs rain and reads objects psychometrically. Rhythm varies well, with longer, sinuous sentences building atmosphere and shorter ones giving key turns (“The fourth morning, she began to delve.”). The voice is strong enough for top-tier venues, with only occasional flirtations with abstract language that could be grounded further in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in touch, material, and sound (“her hands perpetually learning the language of salt and grain”). Diction is generally consistent with a reflective, art-minded protagonist, and the turbine/sea lexicon threads smoothly through the piece. Occasional abstract phrases (“timewoven network,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”) flirt with essayistic register, but they don’t break POV coherence. Overall, the rhythm and texture of the sentences serve the accumulative, reverie-like mode well.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and convincingly close to Sable’s sensibility, with recurring motifs (“amber,” “silver,” “hush”) that create a distinct texture. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion, and psychic distance is handled smoothly, remaining intimate without slipping into essayistic intrusion. At times the diction edges toward generalized lyricism rather than sharply individualized perception, but rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled. The voice serves the accumulative, meditative mode effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct texture that merges archival precision and haunted lyricism (“each word a stone placed carefully on history’s shore”). POV remains cleanly tethered to Elara even when summarizing retrocognitive experiences, and the brief dialogue is natural and charged with subtext. Rhythmic variation supports mood shifts from searing reverie to quieter closure. At times the diction leans toward elevated abstraction (“truth in tension”) that slightly distances us from her embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady and appropriate to a reflective, mythic fable: sentences are controlled, with a measured lyricism and consistent diction. Kael’s perceptual signature is somewhat generalized but coherent—attuned to lanterns, memories, and design metaphors rather than concrete bodily sensation. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext, but narrative distance is stable and tense is consistent. Occasionally the register edges into abstract, essayistic commentary, slightly flattening the otherwise distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and consonant with a meticulous, aging oath-scribe; diction and syntax feel controlled rather than haphazardly ornate. The narrative eye has a distinct perceptual signature—attentive to texture, ancient scripts, and ritual detail—without slipping into omniscient leakage or register clash. Rhythm varies well enough to keep the contemplative prose from becoming monotonous, and there is no dialogue to mismanage. It’s polished and publication-ready at the sentence-paragraph level.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with patterned diction (“borrowed time,” “wild serenity,” “furious tranquility”) and strong control of rhythm across sentences. POV is stable around Elara with no head-hopping, and the voice modulates gently as the ritual intensifies and then settles. At times, the narration feels more like an impersonal mythic commentator than Elara’s specific perception, blurring character-particularity. Despite some repetition and abstraction, the piece maintains a coherent, recognizable narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly lyrical register that suits Elara’s contemplative, observant nature and the austere setting. Her perception is filtered through her vocation (pressure, wind shear, microclimate variations) in a way that gives the narration a consistent, character-specific texture. There is no POV leakage or jarring stance shift. A few lines verge on general essayistic reflection, but they don’t break the core voice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, musical, and clearly filtered through Sola’s sensibility, with recurring motifs (“hush,” “stillness,” “primal elegance”) giving it a distinct texture. Diction and rhythm remain coherent throughout, sustaining a contemplative, almost liturgical cadence that suits the material. There’s little dialogue, but the narrative stance handles reflection and description confidently without head-hopping. At times the register skews toward abstract/philosophical phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound, which slightly dilutes the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, measured, and well-suited to the contemplative, haunted tone. Certain phrases (“tranquilly perceptive,” “tangled covenant,” “mute eloquence”) recur almost like refrains, which supports the lyric mode but can feel programmatic rather than organically voice-driven. The narrative distance stays stable and there is no head-hopping or register clash. Greater textural variation in diction and rhythm at key turns could sharpen emotional peaks and prevent the cadence from becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent lyrical texture with distinctive phrasings (“between noon and memory,” “voice like pages turning”) that feel native to this consciousness and world. POV remains stable and confident, with no head-hopping; even when time becomes non-linear, the narrative stance is controlled and legible. Dialogue in the meeting scene is sparse but appropriately stylized and subtextual for near-mythic figures rather than sounding like exposition in disguise.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative subject; diction choices like “burnished hush” and “woven dawns” give it a recognizable texture. POV is stable with no leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative distance stays appropriately intimate. At times, the voice slides into abstract, essayistic phrasing that feels less embodied and more like authorial commentary. Still, the overall control and coherence would be publishable with tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s patient, methodical sensibility while allowing occasional omniscient touches that feel organic to the fable-like mode. Repetition of key phrases (“gently systematic,” “brazen calm”) reads as deliberate patterning rather than tic, supporting the ritual tone. Syntax varies and tightens appropriately as his body weakens and the work nears completion, without losing clarity. The brief zoom-out to the relief team and new caretaker maintains the established narrative stance and keeps the lens coherent at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture that blends scientific diction and quiet, burnished imagery. POV control is clean—no leakage or unjustified omniscience—and psychic distance is steady. Rhythms tend toward meditative, with patterned phrases (“bronze quiet,” “chemistry of homecoming”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. The risk is a certain sameness of cadence and register across beats, even when narrative pressure should arguably tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a distinct mythic-register vocabulary that suits the coachman’s role and world. Sentences modulate rhythm well—lingering for atmosphere, then tightening slightly around action beats like scattering seeds or digging at the gull’s direction. There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble; the narrative camera stays close enough to his perceptions while preserving an incantatory distance. The voice is memorable and could sit comfortably in a high-end literary venue with minor sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that stays consistent—images like “like reading Braille with his eardrums” feel both character-specific and thematically apt. The narrative filters description through Wick’s sensory priorities (smell, sound) in ways that reinforce his history and skills. Psychic distance remains stable, with brief reflective moves anchored in present stimuli. There are occasional slightly abstract phrases (“tinted revelation”) but they fit the story’s aesthetic rather than reading as register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and suitably interior, with a clear perceptual signature centered on silence, stars, and ritual. Diction generally fits an introspective, educated spacefarer; the repeated phrases and cadences create a deliberate meditative rhythm. At times, the rhetoric becomes slightly generic and lofty (“a true north of the heart,” “silent music of the cosmos”), blurring individuality. Still, point of view remains controlled and stable, with no leaks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lightly lyrical, and compatible with Kaelen’s sensibility; the diction around wonder and sacred play is coherent. Rhythm is generally smooth, with some nice cadences (“whispers in a cathedral of glass”). That said, repeated constructions and recycled phrases in the closing run (“embracing the unknown with open arms,” variations on “ready for the next wrong sky”) blunt the otherwise controlled tone. It’s good, but could use sharper modulation and less echo to feel truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear fondness for paradoxes like “luminous absence” and “benevolently ruthless,” which gives the narrative a recognizable texture. POV distance is consistent and appropriate for an allegorical piece, though it keeps us at an observational remove from Kael’s more visceral reactions. Rhythm is generally well managed, but the diction sometimes drifts toward abstract and sermon-like in the closing third, with little modulation to reflect changing pressure. Still, the voice feels unified and intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person, lyric-leaning voice is consistent, with a distinctive blend of tactile and metaphoric perception (e.g., “air tasted of dust and forgotten stories,” “her past a shard that cut each recollection”). Rhythm and diction mostly stay controlled and purposeful, modulating slightly as pressure rises at the stone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice feels appropriate to a seer whose vision is literally fractured. Occasionally the register edges toward generalized poeticism rather than Mira-specific noticing, keeping it just below truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and mostly well calibrated, with lyrical but controlled diction that fits the fable-like magical realism. The narrative maintains consistent psychic distance, slipping naturally between description and his internal stakes. However, the voice often sounds generically “literary” rather than distinctly this tutor’s consciousness; his professional sensibility appears in places (chess vocabulary) but could color perception more. Dialogue is minimal yet serviceable, particularly the girl’s understated request.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with striking phrasings (“sky that forgot how to be blue,” “forged hush”) that feel unified rather than random. Kael’s spoken lines and Mara’s brief dialogue are natural enough and serve the thematic tension without breaking the established register. At times, the narrative diction drifts toward abstract, essaylike commentary that feels more authorial than character-filtered, especially in the final paragraphs. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and confident, if occasionally more didactic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm and a lexicon that fits an alchemist in a dire, enchanted environment. Diction like “kintsugi intentions,” “liquid sunrise,” and “brass filament of pure meaning” is elevated but consistent, forming a clear perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance stays tight to Elara’s perceptions and logic, and shifts toward abstraction map to her hypoxia and altered state. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift, and the narration’s certainty matches what she could plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lucid, and appropriately lyrical for the contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm show some intentional patterning (“temporary eternity,” “hidden oasis,” “intimately aloof”) that supports the meditative tone without losing clarity. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and psychic distance is controlled. The voice is pleasant and cohesive, if not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward vibration, scent, and pressure that fits both character and premise. Phrasing like “his voice became just another kind of silence” and “the scream of his tenderness finally found its shape in the quiet” shows rhythmic command without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Marcus’s few spoken words carry heavy subtext precisely because the narrative has framed his usual shouting as a compensating flaw. Psychic distance is modulated smoothly, dipping into backstory then snapping back to concrete action as needed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and recognizably biased toward cosmological and mechanical imagery, giving Kael a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a consistent, slightly elevated diction that matches the quasi-mythic, SF-tinged tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative doesn’t resort to explanatory handholding. Occasionally the rhetoric edges toward purple, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is coherent and textured, blending scientific precision with lyric, almost mystical perception of landscape and object. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional, with a consistent perceptual signature (e.g., earth that “remembered the taste of truth”). There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift. A few repeated constructions and phrases slightly reduce the sense of cutting-edge polish but not the distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a distinct textural feel in phrases like “his silhouette a jagged stitch against the fading light.” Diction and rhythms are consistent across the piece and modulate appropriately between misty description and tighter investigative focus. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narration’s certainty matches what Cornelius can infer. A touch of generic phrasing (“quiet testament,” repeated “softly persistent”) keeps the voice from feeling utterly singular but doesn’t materially harm it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with diction that suits an introspective antiquarian who thinks in maps and patterns. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, modulating nicely from quieter observational beats to more charged, compressed moments in the cavern. The narrative stance stays anchored in Merrick’s perceptions without unmotivated omniscience, aside from a purposeful final image of the chip sinking. The perceptual signature—seeing ant trails as “cartography,” equations in filigree, maps in everything—feels distinct and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, confident, and well suited to a lyrical, mythic mode; diction and rhythm are controlled and distinctive without being opaque. The perceptual signature—attention to pattern, frost, light, and breath—feels specific to this sensibility rather than generic fantasy prose. Shifts in intensity (climb vs revelation vs final stasis) are handled through modulation of cadence rather than clumsy register jumps. A touch of explanation-heavy narration in the middle keeps it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly tuned to a character who thinks in cosmological and alchemical metaphors; this gives the piece a discernible texture. Kael’s dialogue is slightly more grounded but still tends toward aphoristic pronouncements, which blurs distinction between his spoken voice and the narrative register. POV is controlled and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction edges into uniform high-register abstraction, reducing the sense of an individuated mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly skewed by the chronicler’s profession and condition, with idiosyncratic metaphors (“wind…like a bored oracle,” “mountain’s pulse”) forming a clear perceptual signature. POV remains stable and trustworthy in its own surreal terms, with no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the lyric compression is taught early and sustained. Rhythm and syntax are generally well modulated, moving between longer ornate sentences and sharper declaratives at turn-points (“Chronological confusion wasn’t a symptom anymore; it was the terrain I navigated”). At elite level, a touch more rhythmic variation and restraint in a few metaphor clusters could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Elena’s profession and loss—she “watches viscosity,” “reads between lines” of sensation, etc. Marcus’s dialogue has its own measured, philosophical cadence that still feels like a person rather than an author mouthpiece. POV is stable and distance shifts are smooth, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few aphoristic lines feel more like authorial commentary than organic thought, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kaelin’s sensibility, with consistent diction that suits a ceremonial, magical context. Phrasal repetition (“saturated hush,” “breath between storms”) feels mostly pattern-driven rather than accidental, contributing to the hypnotic cadence. At times, though, the lyricism flattens modulation—intensity doesn’t spike or roughen at peak beats, so the voice risks sameness across emotional registers. For a prestigious venue, a touch more rhythmic and tonal variation under pressure would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends gossip-column flair and occult sensitivity. Dialogue is spare but effective, with Linden’s lines terser and more declarative against Mira’s metaphorical tendencies. Rhythm and diction mostly support the ethereal yet grounded tone without drifting into an implausible register for the characters. The main limiter is that the narrative voice occasionally feels more like an external stylist than something tightly bound to Mira’s lived syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a confident, cosmic-lyric register that suits the premise and remains consistent in diction and distance. Phrasing like “wanderingly exact” and “a structure lost between the tick and tock of existence” gives the prose a distinct texture and perceptual signature. Narrative certainty matches the conceit of a liminal, almost outside-time observer, and there is no head-hopping or stance wobble. The one spoken line (from the spiral arbitration) feels of a piece with the narration’s elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture built from recurring motifs (razor edges, quiet, counting). Diction is controlled and consistent with a contemplative, slightly heightened register; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythms and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, even with patterned repetition. The voice is memorable and coherent, though its insistence on certain images risks a faintly programmatic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and technically informed, with distinctive phrases like “spiral logic of grief” and “quiet wildfire” giving a strong perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a reflective, analytically inclined specialist observing an uncanny environment. The few spoken lines from the woman are spare and believable, contrasting nicely with the more abstract narration. Occasionally the register drifts into manifesto (“revolutionize the entire agricultural security sector”), but it doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately colored by Lila’s mathematical background and grief, with images like “city’s arteries” and “clover-melancholy” giving it a distinct texture. Diction stays in a high but coherent register without head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts. At times, the phrasing leans toward generalized lyricism rather than idiosyncratically Lila-specific thought, which slightly blurs the perceptual signature. Still, rhythm and syntax are controlled and suit the meditative, accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, slightly lyrical, and suits the quasi-mythic, underground setting; it maintains a consistent distance and focalization through Mira. Diction like “cultivated estrangement” and “melodically haunted” feels intentional and character-compatible rather than arbitrarily elevated. At times, the prose slips into generalized uplift (“the world opened its arms”) that sounds more like authorial commentary than Mira’s filtered perception. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and rhythm is generally controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to an archivist absorbed in delicate preservation; phrases like “gently thorough” and “weight of small moments” feel character-appropriate. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and recurrent diction builds a recognizable texture. At times the register drifts toward abstract or essayistic (“larger-than-story healing,” “when context changes”), which slightly distances us from her embodied perspective. Still, the POV control is clean and the voice distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The omniscient, slightly fable-like narrative voice is consistent and suits the material, with pleasing turns of phrase (“polite anarchy,” “wandering circus of strangers who traded rumors instead of tickets”). Psychic distance is steady; the narrator mediates events more than inhabiting any one interior, which fits the mythic tone. Some phrasing trends generalized or explanatory, keeping us at arm’s length from lived emotion, but there are no jarring register shifts or POV slips. Rhythm and diction are controlled, if occasionally more declarative than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Elara’s sensory world and preoccupations. Syntax and diction maintain a stable, elevated register that suits the contemplative tone and never feel like random ornament. Recurrent phrases like “quiet blaze” and “language” build pattern rather than read as tics, and the psychic distance is well managed. Some lines in the final third lean into abstract summary, which slightly dulls the otherwise strong immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to a character who listens to “static of dying stars”; diction and rhythm feel cohesive throughout. There is good modulation from dense description to more reflective cadence as Kael’s stance crystallizes, without head-hopping or POV leakage. Some repeated formulations (“strange comfort,” seed metaphors) verge on self-conscious patterning but mostly read as intentional motif. Overall, the voice is confident and controlled, if just shy of the razor precision expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm and a consistent metaphoric palette tied to water, music, and mapping. Diction and syntax feel unified with Elias’s liminal, contemplative state and maintain stable psychic distance throughout. The rare direct dialogue is spare and well-placed, letting gesture and description carry most of the communication. There’s no POV leakage or explanatory helper-narrator tone; the lyricism feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends analytic precision (Fibonacci progression, skylight angles) with molten emotional imagery. Diction and rhythm feel unified with Kael’s sensibility—patient, obsessive, and haunted—without lapsing into abstract vagueness or head-hopping. Psychic distance stays controlled across summary (“They worked for weeks…”) and close-focus beats, and the few elevated phrases match the quasi-mythic tone. There is some density of metaphor, but it reads as deliberate texture rather than uncontrolled purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility, with scientific and musical metaphors twined in a way that feels character-appropriate. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between more expansive descriptive passages and tighter, urgent lines as the drone nears and his hands bleed. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-style abstraction is notably absent) mostly stays within the story’s established register. A slight risk is uniform lushness even under peak stress, but it doesn’t significantly undercut immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly lyrical but anchored in Marek’s occupational perspective, with phrases like “calculated spontaneity” matching his mindset. Exposition about his gift and tools is folded into the narration smoothly enough that it doesn’t feel like info-dump. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the smuggler’s oily, aphorism-twisting line and Marek’s understated question to the watchman land in character. There’s a slight authorial aphoristic tilt at the end, but not enough to break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled repetition (“half-spoken secret,” “stillwater tension”) and a distinct textural signature that suits the meditative mode. Psychic distance is stable; we never head-hop, and the narration’s certainties match its quasi-mythic stance. A few phrases edge toward self-conscious ornamentation (“spiralingly calm presence coiled around the child”) but clarity remains intact. The voice is strong enough for publication but would need slight deflation of the more purple touches for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits the contemplative, fable-like mode. Recurrent phrases (“amplified quiet,” “forest of second thoughts”) create a recognizable texture without collapsing into self-parody. Psychic distance is stable; we stay close enough to Hartwin to understand his aims without head-hopping or unexplained elision. A bit more idiosyncratic perception or sharper lexical specificity tied to his particular mind could distinguish the voice further at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with fluid rhythms and a clear perceptual filter that orients us through physical action and image. Phrasing like “a dancer of the tide” and “lives now in the liminal space” feels unified rather than stitched from disparate registers. Occasionally the diction leans toward generalized poeticism, but it doesn’t break distance or clarity, and the modulation from workaday docks to mythic island reads intentional and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical rhythm that suits the contemplative dystopian mood. Recurrent phrasings and patterned syntax (“the performer would…”) create a chant-like cadence that generally works but edges toward monotony. Diction is controlled and mostly aligned with the character’s perspective, though occasionally it feels more authorial-abstract than embodied. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice could vary its texture more under different emotional pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and distinctly tuned to this character’s aesthetic attentiveness; diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly consistent. Sensory metaphors like “lantern-moth hush” and “spine of frozen music” feel organic to the consciousness involved. There is some stylistic redundancy (frequent return to “paraphrase,” “tremor of certainty,” “dissolve boundaries”) that slightly blunts impact, but not to the point of confusion. Overall, the voice is strong enough to carry a quiet, plot-light piece.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntax and a clear aesthetic sensibility; it handles the magical-realist register confidently. Focalization stays mostly close to Elara with occasional, light dips into Dorian that don’t break coherence. Rhythm and diction generally suit a mythic, fable-like tone without major register clashes. Some lines drift toward explanatory or thesis-like phrasing, which slightly dulls the otherwise strong texture.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual bias toward sound and light that feels particular to Kaelen. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical scientific setting, and psychic distance is stable. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, differentiating Mara’s brisk certainty from Kaelen’s gentler, more probing stance. At times the narrative register leans toward essayistic abstraction, slightly diluting the embodied immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, metaphysically curious, and closely aligned with Elara’s sensibility; it maintains a coherent distance and register throughout. Syntax and diction show deliberate rhythmic control and a distinctive texture (“genuinely artificial weight,” “white dwarf—dense, collapsed, but still casting light”) that fits the premise. The brief dialogue at the end feels natural within the elevated tone and carries subtext without breaking voice. There is some risk of tonal sameness in the high-register abstraction, but it largely serves the story’s aims rather than flattening them.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s analytical, pattern-obsessed mind. Diction and metaphor system are consistent—economy, geometry, code, and weather interlace in a way that feels like one sensibility rather than committee prose. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying clear status dynamics and subtext (the architect’s shift from failed priest of a dead religion to hungry student). At times the narration drifts toward expository abstraction, but it remains anchored enough in concrete image to retain texture and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice has a consistent, elevated, lyrical register that suits the mythic tone, with recurring phrases like “steadily unpredictable” and “anguished joy” defining its texture. The perceptual focus on light, sigils, and subatomic nostalgia feels character-appropriate for a historian in a haunted archive. At times, diction edges toward uniform grandiosity, with similar sentence cadences and repeated constructions that slightly flatten the dynamic range. Nonetheless, POV control is clean and the voice feels unified rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, speculative frame. Diction like “sharp-eyed dusk noticer,” “blooming library,” and “luminous regret” gives the piece a distinct texture without major register slips. Psychic distance stays steady, hovering close enough to her perceptions while maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated tone. There are some repeated constructions and phrases, but they read as pattern rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to sensory detail and living creatures. Diction and rhythm suit a quiet, reflective character under strain, and the prose modulates well between lyric description and concrete action. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register shifts; even more abstract lines feel grounded in her mental state. It’s distinctive and polished enough for an elite venue, though a touch more idiosyncratic phrasing uniquely tied to Elara (rather than generally “literary” lyricism) could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a gently lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative mode. Diction is mostly consistent and avoids jarring register shifts, and the plant telepathy is cleanly filtered through Elara’s perspective. At times, the prose leans on generic formulations (“poem of survival,” “gentle hum of possibility”) that feel less character-specific and more authorial. Nonetheless, POV control is solid and the narrative stance remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive, consistent texture—lyric, image-heavy, and keyed to Mira’s sensibility (“silver screen’s hidden reels,” “hushed thunder of revelation”). Psychic distance is stable, with no head-hopping, and the rhythm modulates well between dense metaphor and clearer expository bridges. Diction is elevated but coherent with the slightly mythic register of a “last crystal gazer” in an old palace. There’s mild repetition of certain constructions (“spatially imaginative mind,” “hushed thunder”), but it reads as motif rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility, with consistent diction and rhythm. There are some memorable turns of phrase (“unwritten calendar,” “shadowed rapture”), and the cadence suits the contemplative mode. At times, the imagery stack risks sameness (stars, stardust, cosmic whispers) rather than modulation, but it doesn’t break coherence. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct, if a bit uniformly elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent diction and a stable focalization through the guard. Quantum and ecological concepts are integrated into the voice in a way that feels stylistically unitary rather than info-dumpy. The single foreign-character insertion (“干涉ed”) risks drawing attention to itself as cleverness rather than deepening voice, but does not fracture POV. Overall, stance and distance are well controlled, with measured shifts into more hymn-like cadence toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is stable, confident, and distinctive, with patterned phrases (“probable miracles,” “the sound of wind through different trees”) used intentionally rather than mechanically. Diction matches the philosophical-fabulist register and the shifts in intensity—especially around the hum crescendo—are controlled. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative modesty about what is “really” happening stays consistent with the metaphoric design. At times, the voice edges toward generalized abstraction instead of the character-specific noticing that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently lyrical, and consistent, with a clear fondness for lulling rhythms and repeated motifs (“shoreline lullaby,” “gentle, persistent”). This creates a distinct tonal fabric that suits the meditative mode. At the same time, the cadence can verge on monotony, with many sentences sharing similar structure and register, and the narration occasionally drifts into generalized abstraction rather than Lin-specific noticing. Still, POV control is clean, and the voice feels unified rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that feels consistent with Elara’s reflective, wounded perspective. Diction and rhythm are confident, with recurring religious-musical language (precentor, silent-choir, sacred signs) enriching both world and inner state without slipping into abstraction. Interior access and narrative distance remain stable, and the brief bit of on-page signed “dialogue” with the precentor is handled cleanly. The voice feels singular and deliberate, with no noticeable POV leakage or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The omniscient, lyrical voice is confident and consistent, with a strong mythic-cosmic idiom that fits the material. Syntax and rhythm are generally controlled, and the narrative stance remains stable without head-hopping. The distance, however, keeps us at an almost ceremonial remove from Sylvar’s inner life, which dampens emotional immediacy in peak beats. Even so, the voice’s texture and cadence are distinctive enough to carry the story.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-matched to Lina’s contemplative, technical sensibility. Repetition of phrases (“periodically eternal,” the tapping motif) forms a deliberate rhythm that suits the sea’s cadence and her habit-ritual. There is occasional abstract phrasing and explanatory diction, but it does not break the perceptual signature or feel outside her plausible inner lexicon. Overall the voice feels unified and confident, if not radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and convincingly filtered through Kai’s sensibility, with a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Her way of noticing—frequencies, patterns, the feel of metal and stone under bare feet—forms a distinct perceptual signature that stays coherent under rising intensity. Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush sentences offset by clean, functional lines to manage pacing. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the illusion, and the lyric mode is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person narration is steady and confident, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s relationship to plants and the land. Rhythm and diction are controlled and occasionally lyrical without losing clarity, and the register matches the quasi-mythic, speculative tone. Interior and exterior observations are well balanced, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A bit more modulation of sentence rhythm around the climactic unsealing could heighten emotional pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s pattern-oriented mind and somatic focus. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and the lyricism generally feels character-anchored rather than generic; technical terms like “somatic marker” and “forensic architect” fit his background. The curator’s few lines of dialogue are spare, slightly oracular, and support the tone without breaking plausibility. Occasional abstract statements in the latter paragraphs tilt toward essay-voice, but not enough to blur POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (visual-metaphoric, art-inflected, slightly surreal). Syntax and rhythm modulate well with pressure, and the lyric register feels appropriate to Elara’s sensibility and the speculative frame. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift. A few lines verge on ornate, but they remain legible and voice-justified rather than generically purple.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinctive cool intensity that suits Kael’s “serene anger” and the speculative tone. Lexicon and rhythm are largely consistent, and the sensory focus (light, wind, patterns) reflects his priorities. Some phrasal repetition and explanation-heavy lines (“He theorized that…”) slightly blunt the lyric effect and compress the psychic distance into a flatter, more expository mode at times. Still, the perceptual signature is clear and free of head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in the way Elara notices mechanisms, schematics, and the behavior of cold. Rhythms vary well between longer, lyric sentences and punchier beats around key turns (“Within the blink that follows surprise, she made her choice”), and the distance stays stable without head-hopping. Purposeful repetitions of key phrases (“dizzying quiet,” “through dormant networks”) build pattern rather than feeling like accidental loops. A handful of slightly abstract formulations occasionally pull away from her embodied perspective, but they don’t significantly disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits Lyra’s attentiveness and the meditative tone. Diction is consistent and mostly filtered through her perception, and the few lines of dialogue are natural and unobtrusive. Recurrent phrases (“quiet fire,” “chaos,” “bloomed”) verge on overuse but do establish a recognizable cadence rather than mechanical patterning. Psychic distance remains stable and clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable, with a strong perceptual signature: mythic diction, patterned repetition, and rich sensory synesthesia. “Voiced through silence,” “sleepwalking constellations,” and “smoke made of midnight and milk” feel cohesive rather than random. Psychic distance remains consistent, and there’s no head-hopping; all certainties are plausible for this slightly elevated, mythic-focalized stance. Occasionally the repeated “transliterated” risks feeling like a craft tic, but here it largely functions as an intentional motif.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and consistent with a highly educated, reflective heiress steeped in journalism and metaphor. Sentences exhibit deliberate rhythm and textured diction without major register slips, and the conceptual analogies feel like how *this* mind thinks. Occasional explicit logical phrasing (“Proof by contradiction: assume the board is right…”) is voice-plausible given her background and the tone of the piece. There’s room to heighten individuality even further, but as-is it’s solidly above-average and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, musical, and confidently handles abstract conceits without losing clarity. Diction and metaphor feel native to Elara’s world (constellations, firmware, cries) and maintain a coherent psychic distance, with no head-hopping or register clashes. Rhythm modulates well, expanding for lyric description and tightening around key ritual beats. The slight limitation is that the voice, while strong, sometimes prioritizes conceptual elegance over raw, idiosyncratic emotional texture that would make Elara feel even more singular.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits the magical-realist premise (“the grotto exhaled a lilac unease”). Diction and imagery are cohesive and clearly filtered through this artist-centered sensibility, and the prose modulates effectively from exploratory to solemn around the climax. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusion; even abstract phrases feel voice-motivated. A few formulations verge on self-conscious (“socially perceptive as any diplomat’s”), but they do not disrupt the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a recognizable lyric cadence and a clear perceptual filter through Arin. Recurrent images (shattered sky, embers, tessera) give the voice a cohesive texture, and POV never slips. That said, the diction and rhythm become somewhat uniform and incantatory, with favored phrases returning so often that they start to feel like authorial tics rather than character-specific perception. Strong and controlled, but not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and well-suited to a ghostly, lyrical tale; the synesthetic perceptions provide a distinct lens. Rhythm is generally controlled, with sentences varying enough to avoid monotony, and the omniscient tilt at the actress’s feelings fits the fable-like mode. Some diction and repeated constructions (“fractured timeline,” “echoes,” “synesthetic”) risk feeling incantatory rather than fresh by the end. Overall, the voice is coherent and confident but not yet singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct: sensorial, slightly scientific, and aesthetically attuned, befitting a light-painting artist engaged with quasi-technical experimentation. Phrases like “fractally precise nanotech” and “willowglass hope” recur as deliberate motifs, giving the diction a recognizable signature. Some repetition edges toward self-consciousness, but not enough to break the spell or feel like artifact. POV discipline is clean, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably lyrical, with recurring diction around echoes, maps, and silence that fits Lira’s sensibility. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative does not claim knowledge beyond what this focalization can reasonably infer. While the voice is polished, it’s not yet strikingly idiosyncratic; many lines could belong to a generalized lyric SF narrator. Still, rhythm and register are even and modulate gently with the story’s emotional intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrically patterned, and consistent, with a distinct diction and rhythm that suits the mythic, contemplative premise. The narrative distance stays stable, offering rich description without arbitrary head-hopping or unexplained jumps in knowledge. Phrases like “time pooled like resin” and “buttons harvested from echo-catchers” display a strong perceptual signature. The risk of excess is managed; while the register is elevated, it feels coherent with the story’s fable-like perspective rather than authorially intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyricism that fits a reflective, competent operative under strain. Diction such as “prudently daring,” “network,” and “northern corridor” grounds us in a spy-world register without sliding into jargon; the atmospheric language feels like Kael’s thought-style rather than authorial frosting. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and natural for cautious operatives; it advances the negotiation and carries status dynamics economically. Psychic distance stays steady and appropriate, letting interiority and scene co-exist without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical yet grounded diction that fits an older coachman whose life has become entwined with fog, gutters, and harness-work. Patterns like “through ambient awareness” and the ticking motif create a recognizable rhythmic signature without becoming unintelligible. The brief dialogue at the end feels natural and slightly formal, matching their history and the story’s tone. A few high-register abstractions (“geometry of fog,” “distillation they had both pursued”) slightly distance us from his embodied consciousness but do not break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Kai’s craft and temperament—metaphors of clay, glaze, and wheels feel like her thinking rather than authorial overlay. Rhythm and syntax are varied and confident, with good modulation between dense description and cleaner declarative lines at key turns. There is no head-hopping or confusing stance; the slight omniscient tilt around the oasis’s properties still feels compatible with the mode. It’s distinctive and controlled, though not quite at the breathtaking precision needed for the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct rhythm and sensory bias that clearly belong to this character and world. Recurrent phrasings (“rhythm of oars in water,” “luminous harbor”) are patterned rather than accidental, reinforcing cadence. The diction balances technical specificity (bitting gauge, notches) with poetic metaphor without obvious register clashes. Emotional intensity modulates in step with the imagery, maintaining a controlled, unified stance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct preference for scientific-mystical diction (“atomic dance of ancient sunlight,” “patterns of ancient DNA spiraling through the bronze”) that suits the archivist premise. The narrative distance holds steady, and the cadences vary enough to avoid monotony despite frequent parallel structures. Occasionally, abstraction (“time is not a line but a web”) feels more like authorial assertion than a perception grounded in Mara’s embodied moment, but it doesn’t break POV. Overall, the voice is confident and textured, if slightly more polished than pressurized at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture—repeated attention to color, reflection, and quiet—fitting the contemplative mode. POV remains cleanly inside/around Lira without head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Rhythm and diction are generally controlled, with some lovely, memorable turns of phrase. A few abstractions (“prismatic quiet,” “scent of possibility”) feel more writerly than character-specific, slightly diluting the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct blend of technical lexicon and slightly lyrical metaphor that fits a scientifically trained but emotionally invested protagonist. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and free indirect access to Mara’s perceptions (“cosmic tricksters,” “celestial gaslighting”) gives the narrative a particular flavor. There is minimal dialogue, but Dr. Chen’s brief on-page presence reads plausibly and in line with his role. The main constraint is that the voice rarely pushes into truly idiosyncratic territory; it’s strong but not singularly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and consistent in diction, with a clear perceptual bias toward architecture, sound, and geometry. Phrases like “whispered secrets of geometry” and “spatial mutiny” establish a distinct texture that matches Elara’s obsession. There are no POV slips or confusing distance jumps, and modulation under pressure (during the walls-closing beat) remains legible. The elevated register occasionally edges toward uniformity, but it still feels like a single, confident narrative stance rather than generic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s particular way of noticing (geometry, ratios, procedural detail). Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, with sentence music that matches the contemplative, investigative mood without slipping into vagueness. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated shifts in distance; even the reflective passages remain anchored in present triggers (mist, ribbon, canvas). Occasionally the narration edges toward authorial statement rather than character-colored perception, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and sensorially attentive, with a clear perceptual signature in how it links weather, history, and bodily sensation. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, and the diction is largely well-matched to a scientifically literate yet emotionally charged librarian. The repeated phrasing (“nervously confident,” “spongey dread”) edges toward self-conscious motif rather than organic thought. The brief dialogue from the director feels serviceable but generic; nonetheless, POV control and narrative stance remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctively tuned to the fiddler’s sensibility; it notices patterns, textures, and sound in a coherent way. Syntax and diction are mostly controlled, with pleasant rhythmic variation and a clear tonal through-line. Recurrent phrases (“luminous disbelief,” “pixelated amnesty,” “ashes of ‘never’”) risk feeling like a motif checklist rather than evolving voice, but they don’t break focalization. Overall, the voice suits the concept and remains legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and recognizable, with a slightly elevated, lyrical diction that fits the reflective, symbolic mode. The son’s perceptual signature—seeing patterns and codes everywhere—is consistent and informs the prose. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Leo’s “Maybe some circles are meant to be broken, not retraced” landing as a clean pivot line, if somewhat thematically on-the-nose. Repetition of key phrases (“polished calm,” “foreign paper money,” “dusky harmony”) edges toward mannerism but does not break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically tuned to Elara’s sensibility as a “lucid dream chronicler” without stray register shifts or head-hopping. Sentences like “She had discovered that entering lucid sleep while monitoring these stellar pulses allowed her consciousness to drift backward along light-years, becoming a witness to histories trapped in photonic amber” display a distinct, character-appropriate lexicon. The narration balances technical language (photometer, Delta Cephei) with metaphoric texture in a recognizable, stable style. At times, the voice slips toward generalized aphorism (“When understanding dawns…”), but this remains controlled rather than disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and appropriately solemn for mythic fantasy, with consistent diction and no head-hopping. There are some nice phrasings (“calm as a blade before the strike”), and the psychic distance stays reasonably close to the druid’s perceptions. However, sentence rhythms and openings become somewhat repetitive, and the voice leans on stock abstractions (“warlike serenity,” “guarded heart”) that flatten its distinctiveness. It’s professionally readable but not yet singular or striking.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elara’s visionary mind, with recurring organic and cosmic imagery. Psychic distance is handled consistently, and the occasional line of dialogue fits smoothly into the elevated narrative register. A few abstractions (“purposefully curious nature”) slightly flatten an otherwise strong perceptual signature. Overall, the voice feels coherent, confident, and suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that matches Elara’s interior intensity. Phrases like “fiercely gentle” and “dusky resolve” form a recognizable perceptual signature, and the Keeper’s dialogue has a distinct, textural idiom. The narration does not over-explain interiority; it leans on image and action. Minor high-register diction never breaks plausibility for this quasi-mythic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, mildly lyrical texture that suits Mara’s reflective state. Diction and rhythm are generally clean, and brief dialogue from Dale has a distinct, gruff register. The narrative occasionally drifts into generic inspirational register in the closing stretch, which feels less particular to Mara’s mind. Still, POV control is solid and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinctive lexicon that marries technical (“field,” “distribution”) and mystical (“spirit,” “knowledge fruit”) registers in a coherent way. POV is steady, with no leakage or unearned omniscience, and the single on-page line of dialogue matches Elara’s described “kindly methodical” temperament. Rhythm is varied and mostly well-calibrated to the contemplative, accumulative mode. Slight repetition of key phrases and a tendency toward abstract summation in the last third keep it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s hybrid perception: mechanical lexicon (protocols, sensors, annular furnace) braided with sensuous, almost nostalgic impressions (living water, sunlight on skin). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (tide, moon, brass, wintersun) giving the prose a distinct texture that matches the character’s state. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage; even more abstract lines feel like her internal conceptualization rather than authorial intrusion. The voice modulates subtly as her identity migrates back toward center, registering both technical observation and emotional quiet in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Mara notices structures, sound, and light. Third-person limited remains stable, and the diction feels unified even as it rises to accommodate the more mystical aspects of the caves. At times the narration edges into a generalized essayistic register near the end, but the overall stance and rhythm remain strong and character-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, readable, and mostly aligned with Mira’s perceptions, with a consistent, gently lyrical cadence. Phrasing such as “raw solace,” “stain,” “map references…like wounds,” and reiterated river wisdom creates a recognizable texture without serious register slips. At times, the diction relies on familiar constructions and repeats key phrases, which blunts distinctiveness. Still, focalization is controlled, with no head-hopping or confusing shifts in stance or time.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the dreamlike, allegorical mode. Diction is controlled and mostly coherent, even when invoking quasi-technical language like “propagation delays,” which feels intentional rather than jarringly academic. Psychic distance stays stable, hovering close enough to her perceptions without head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is distinctive but not yet so idiosyncratic or pressure-responsive that it feels singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Lira’s plant-telepathy and archivist sensibility; metaphors of seeds, songs, and veils feel organically hers. Third-person limited focalization holds steady, and psychic distance is well-controlled, dipping closer at choice points without head-hopping. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively between lush description and more compressed decision moments. There is some risk of tonal uniformity in the high-poetic register, but it remains legible and character-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (technical yet mystical, keyed to frequencies, static, and light) that feels native to Elara’s mindset. Recurrent phrases (“lucidly watchful,” “radiant hush,” the language of threads and droplets) build a controlled rhythm without tipping into monotony. There’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience; the narration stays closely aligned with what she can perceive and infer. The modulation between calm description and slightly heightened urgency around the droplet is subtle but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility; diction like “kindly decisive” and “cloud-wanderer” feels diegetic rather than imposed. Rhythm and syntax vary well, supporting the contemplative mood without monotony. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and reflective passages are cleanly anchored to sensory triggers (bark under her palms, the hairpin, the moon). A slight tendency toward overt abstract phrasing in the epiphanic lines keeps the voice from feeling utterly effortless at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The first-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to a reflective, quasi-fantastical vignette; diction and rhythm are reasonably controlled. The narrator’s way of noticing (wind chimes as language, cloak as paradox) provides a distinct perceptual signature. At times, phrasing drifts into slightly self-conscious formulation (“sincerely insincere,” “protected vulnerability”), but it still fits the reflective register. POV boundaries are respected, and the brief dialogue is consistent with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, lyrically close POV is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—patterned, rhythmic sentences, an almost liturgical cadence, and repeated key phrases. Psychic distance is well controlled for this mode; we stay within Mira’s conceptual frame without drifting into omniscient commentary. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative voice carries the piece. At times, the register approaches grandiose, but it’s largely in keeping with the mythic, meditative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the quasi-mythic content; phrases like “when the world was dreaming itself into being” establish a clear narrative sensibility. Diction stays coherent—elevated but not academic—and the psychic distance is stable, giving us her perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive explanation. Rhythms are controlled, with enough variation in sentence length to avoid monotony even as some parallel structures recur for effect. The voice is more ceremonial than idiosyncratically character-specific, but within the chosen mode it is confident and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“unbinding wonder from stone,” “breaths of evaporating memory”) that suits the contemplative, speculative tone. Third-person limited on Vorrin is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction occasionally edges toward abstract, but it remains legible and character-aligned rather than drifting into generic essay voice. The modulation from industrial gloom to high, frozen sublimity feels controlled and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and distinct, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits Elias’s synesthetic focus. Imagery (“a silver coin tossed into a sea of ink,” “shade between violet and void”) has a recognizable signature and rarely lapses into clumsy phrasing. Psychic distance stays consistent and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some repeated constructions and motifs slightly flatten the rhythm, but not enough to harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly stamped by Elara’s cosmological lexicon (wavelengths, timelines, entropy, static). Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a consistent, elevated register that matches the mythic/apocalyptic frame. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the free-indirect tilt feels coherent under stress. Occasionally the diction flirts with over-saturated cosmic terminology, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than drifting into generic “space operatic” mush.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent and well-controlled, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in instruments, light, and the textures of time and duty. Diction and rhythm suit a centuries-old reaper without sliding into archaism or modern psych-speak, and the psychic distance stays stable. The occasional explicit thematic statement jars a bit against the otherwise image-driven, oblique voice but doesn’t break it. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and unified enough to support publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-modulated, with a clear perceptual signature centered on light, water, and slow, patient processes. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose musical without becoming mannered, and the narrative distance stays stable. Diction fits both the quasi-mythic frame and Kael’s sensibility, with phrases like “plausible impossibility” feeling earned rather than grandiose. There’s no dialogue to test range, but as a single-POV lyric piece, the voice is confident and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, calm, and lyrically inclined, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual filter through Nora’s profession and temperament. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance never slips into unjustified omniscience or head-hopping. At times the voice leans toward generic-poetic formulations instead of sharper, character-particular phrasing, which slightly dulls its distinctiveness at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive way of yoking scientific and mystical diction (“each color a memory of a different age,” “a language older than numbers”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well, allowing long, lush sentences without losing legibility. The narrative stance stays tightly bound to her sensibility even as it leans into mythic registers, and there is no POV leakage or awkward exposition. The elevated register occasionally edges toward overt statement, but it generally feels earned by the character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and well-matched to the contemplative, SF-lyric mode, with recurring phrases (“soundless echo,” “watcher’s burden,” “preserve trust under pressure”) building pattern. Diction is mostly consistent and controlled, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip. That said, the voice risks sameness: many sentences share similar cadence and abstract diction, which slightly dulls peaks that should feel sharper. A bit more modulation—shorter, harsher lines during the override, less repetition of key phrases—would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably elevated for a mythic martial-arts metaphysical tale. It maintains a coherent psychic distance, blending close interior access with declarative world-framing without head-hopping. Some sentences verge on authorial thesis rather than character-filtered perception, which slightly undercuts the sense of a fully character-bound voice. Overall, the rhythm and diction are distinctive and mostly well-managed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and unobtrusive, with a consistent lyrical register suited to the meditative mode. However, diction leans toward generalized poeticism (“hush of a possibility just born,” “pungent crescendo,” “orthogonal paths”) that could belong to many narrators, so Mara’s perceptual signature never fully sharpens. Repeated key phrases erode some of the line-to-line freshness. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense and distance are well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is close to Eleanor yet allows brief, clean access to Sarah’s external reactions without head-hopping into her mind, maintaining a coherent focal lens. Diction and rhythm are distinctive and controlled, with playful grotesquerie (“choir of broken kazoos,” “cymbal’s sharp kiss”) balanced against tenderness. Psychic distance modulates well: more expansive and metaphorical around the haunting, tighter around key beats like Sarah’s cracked laughter or the cord dissolving. The slightly essayistic closing lines about what haunting is are tonally consistent but a bit more expository than the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent psychic distance close to the guardian’s consciousness while still accommodating conceptual reflection. Diction and imagery (“interiorizing exteriors,” “a key to no door,” “move through both like a word through silence”) create a strong perceptual signature that feels specific to a feral but contemplative guardian. The rhythm of sentences varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the narrative stance remains stable. On occasion the register trends slightly generalized/essayistic, but it doesn’t significantly undercut the immersive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is a controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct texture—dense imagery, purposeful repetitions (“hopeless,” “penny drops,” “creative destruction”) and a consistent, solemn register that matches Elara’s temperament. Focalization stays cleanly with Elara, and the narrative distance is well managed: close enough for her conceptual realizations, but not so close that it lapses into therapy-speak. The diction occasionally leans into overt abstraction in thematic lines, but overall the rhythms and word choices feel deliberate rather than generic. It’s distinctive and publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct texture that blends technical concreteness (“amplifier modules,” “copper wire”) and lyrical cosmology without losing control. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a highly skilled, quasi-poetic technician and stay stable under pressure. The narrative distance is well managed; we remain inside Mira’s perceptual lens without unjustified omniscience or head-hopping. The few meta/abstract phrasings still feel like her thoughts rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly focalized through Lina, with no head-hopping. Recurrent phrases and patterns (clocks sliding sideways, starlight pooling, resilient positivity) create a recognizable texture. At times the diction drifts into generic-poetic (“beyond reality,” “ever-shifting dark”), which blunts distinctiveness and feels a bit template-like for a prestigious venue. Still, the overall stance and rhythm are controlled and consistent with the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-inflected, with phrases like “unsettling calm had become her bones” signaling a distinct sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied, supporting the surreal atmosphere without losing coherence. There’s no dialogue to test multi-voice work, but psychic distance and access to Mira’s perceptions remain stable. The piece feels assured rather than generic or workshopped.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a scientifically literate, contemplative instructor living in a strange, pressurized world. The diction around “edge geometry,” “pressure-gradient mapping,” and “benthic city” feels integrated with her mindset rather than pasted-on jargon. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the Tethian elder’s lines carrying tonal and conceptual weight, and Corin’s question crystallizing the thematic pivot. A few coinages and repetitions (“balancedly curious,” frequent “unfolded horizons”) slightly strain naturalness, but they don’t break focalization or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; phrases like “contact tracer for hearts” and “reeling hush” feel voice-specific rather than generic. Psychic distance is steady, and the narration’s certainty matches what the character can plausibly know. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional. At times the lyricism borders on over-patterned, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close-third voice is consistent, lyrically technical, and clearly filtered through a character comfortable with scientific and metaphorical thinking. Diction choices like “electromagnetic ghostprints” and “phase transitions were the facility’s language” feel of a piece with the world and Marek’s mindset. Rhythm varies well and supports mood; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the register edges toward abstract-poetic in ways that slightly blur Marek’s embodied experience under peak stress, but not enough to damage POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well controlled, with a distinct texture (“rose from the snow like a frozen thought,” “air tasted of old circuits and winter”). Psychic distance remains consistent, and the brief ghost dialogue fits the established tone without jarring register shifts. The narrative confidently balances concrete image with abstraction, and there is no POV leakage or gratuitous exposition. Some lines (“write a new chapter”) feel more conventional than the rest, but they don’t break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and distinctive, with metaphor and diction tightly aligned to the world’s logic (bone, copper, stone, echo). Focalization remains stable around the storyteller’s sensibility even in more omniscient-feeling later sentences; the distance is modulated but controlled. Rhythms are varied and purposeful, with longer, rolling sentences for mythic scope and shorter declaratives at key turns (“The diamond’s song was perfect, but it was a translation no one could understand.”). There’s no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriately lyrical for the material, with patterned phrases like “static-laden confessions” and “harmony untamed” giving it a recognizable texture. Psychic distance stays consistent around Lyn, and the brief dialogue from Elian fits the mythic register without jarring. At times, the diction edges toward generalized poetry rather than Lyn-specific perception, slightly flattening her as an individuated sensibility. Still, rhythm and stance are controlled enough for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette (ash, embers, rhythms, ticking) that feels specific to this world and Elara’s musical perception. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well with intensity, especially around the clocktower’s counter-pulse and her heart’s stutter. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the occasional elevated diction matches the fable-like tone. A few abstract formulations brush against over-grandiosity but do not break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with a clear sensibility attuned to neon, machinery, and emotional undertones. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic framing of this courier figure; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some rhythmic similarity and fondness for metaphor risk mild sameness across sentences but do not blur POV or intent. The prose modulates adequately at key beats (launch, receipt of the message) without losing its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the material, with repeated phrases (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) building a recognizable cadence. Focalization stays with Silas’s perceptions without head-hopping or register slips. The narrative distance remains consistent and controlled, modulating gently as the stakes shift from routine labor to numinous discovery. At times the diction’s uniform hush flattens intensity, but it never breaks POV logic or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, precise, and texturally distinctive, comfortably mixing mathematical and poetic registers (“equation for narrative gravitation,” “pedestal of frozen sound waves”). The focalization is mostly steady in a controlled omniscient/lyric mode, and brief access to the corduroy man’s solitude and the patrons’ unawareness feels like deliberate omniscient sweep rather than sloppy head-hopping. Rhythm varies well, with lush, long sentences balanced by tighter beats at key turns (the portal opening, the reawakening). Overall, the narrative stance suits the piece’s hybrid scientific-mythic ambition and remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person, lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the premise; patterned phrases such as “in the hush of improbable beginnings” feel intentional and motif-like. Syntax and diction show control, with a distinct texture of compressed, image-rich clauses that teach their own rhythm early. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance doesn’t waver or head-hop. The main constraint is that the highly patterned lyricism occasionally risks sameness of cadence, limiting dynamic range at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward cosmic and locksmith metaphors. Diction like “shadowed nexus,” “cosmic possibility,” and “unassuming boldness” fits the fable-like register and Merrin’s mythic craft. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially the woman’s initial statement about what the hair represents. There is some repetition of key phrases, but it reads more as intentional incantation than as a loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent, with a distinct aphoristic cadence (“The chronically curious do not fear tetanus or ghosts; they fear unanswered questions”). POV distance is steady third-person close, comfortably aligned with Elias’s perceptions and professional idiom. Repeated sentence structures function as motif rather than artifact, and the lyric-essay inflection is controlled rather than diffuse. A slight tendency toward essayistic generalization at thematic peaks keeps it from feeling fully effortless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and closely aligned with the archivist’s sensibility, with consistent diction and a distinct rhythm that fits the quiet, enchanted setting. Dialogue is sparse but effective; the archivist’s silken-blade tone contrasts nicely with Lin’s tentative, plain questions, and lines carry emotional stakes rather than exposition. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge jumps. At moments the narration drifts toward slightly generic abstractions (“quiet resilience,” “combative tenderness that has become her signature”), but not enough to fracture the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The omniscient, lyrical voice is stable, confident, and well-suited to the mythic frame, with controlled diction and a consistent register. The narrative stance balances high abstraction (“essence,” “betweenness”) with enough concrete anchoring to stay legible, and psychic distance doesn’t wobble. Rhythmic variation keeps the prose from feeling mechanically patterned despite its elevated tone. Occasional aphoristic statements edge toward authorial intrusion but don’t seriously break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrical but controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to light, texture, and craft tools (“tapestry needle… glinting like a miniature moon”). Rhythm and diction are consistent and modulate well from tension to dawn’s release without wobbling in register. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; the narration stays anchored in Elara’s sensibility. A few abstract phrases (“geography of survival”) skim the edge of generic lyricism but do not seriously harm the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to Elena’s temperament, with controlled rhythms and recurring phrasing that feel intentional rather than mechanical. The diction (“methodical curiosity,” “shielded openness”) matches the contemplative, art-restorer sensibility and remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident and coherent—a cool, precise lyricism that fits an analytic diver in conversation with personified Death. Diction like “logarithmic decay,” “closed system,” and “minute gravity” feels character-true while remaining readable, and Mort’s slightly wry, understated tone contrasts nicely. Psychic distance stays stable; any semi-omniscient flourishes are grounded in Mort’s nature and the story’s conceit. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to sustain musicality without lapsing into ornament for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The omniscient, lyric narrative voice is consistent in diction and rhythm, with patterned phrases (“tinkersong wonder,” “ghost in code”) that establish a recognizable texture. Psychic distance is steady; we stay outside the characters’ specific thoughts, in a mythic register that suits the fable-like design. At times, the uniform lushness flattens modulation—peak beats and quieter ones sound similar—limiting dynamic range. Still, the voice feels deliberate rather than generic and carries the piece’s atmosphere reliably.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and lyrically inclined without losing clarity, and the diction matches Kai’s contemplative, observant nature. Optical and mechanical details (goggles, prismatic light, ice structure) are filtered through this sensibility, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature.

Occasionally the register leans slightly abstract in the final lines, but overall the POV control and rhythmic modulation are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinctive blend of technical meteorological lexicon and lyrical metaphor that feels organic to Mara’s sensibility. Narrative distance is stable and the descriptive rhythm suits a contemplative, high-suspense situation without becoming opaque. The register remains coherent, and patterned phrases like “empty spaces remember” are intentional rather than accidental repetition. At times, the summary-explanatory voice about her research borders on expository, but it generally maintains character-inflected texture.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in touch and pattern rather than faces, which fits the character perfectly. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony while maintaining a unified, elevated tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrator’s certainty stays plausibly tied to what Kael can infer. Occasionally the register leans toward abstract/philosophical exposition, but it mostly remains anchored in concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, wonder-driven tone. Diction is controlled and consistent, and the few lines of dialogue are natural and aligned with character status (Kess’s brevity versus Elara’s eagerness). The narrative occasionally leans slightly omniscient in its summaries of crew gossip, but without true head-hopping or distance confusion. Overall, the perceptual signature—attentive to maps, bearings, and patterns—is distinct without being mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent and controlled, with recurring motifs (soft hush, frost, mirrors, gears) establishing a clear stylistic signature. Diction is elevated but stable, and there’s no head-hopping or point-of-view confusion. That said, the voice feels more like an omniscient myth-teller than something sharply filtered through this particular locksmith, which limits psychological specificity. Rhythm is pleasant but occasionally monotone in its reliance on similarly cadenced, image-rich sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person, slightly mythic narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and well suited to the allegorical frame. Diction is coherent and the collective perspective is handled cleanly with no head-hopping. Rhythms are pleasant and occasionally musical, though they hover at a similar register throughout, making some passages feel samey. There’s room for more modulation or sharper textural contrast at moments of heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature anchored to the adjuster’s consciousness and mythic vantage. Patterned diction around “hush,” “nested patterns,” and “beautifully flawed” feels intentional and supports the accumulative design rather than random repetition. At times the register leans toward grandiose abstractions, risking slight distance from embodied experience, but it never breaks its own logic or leaks into stray registers. POV remains stable and legible throughout, with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly Elara’s in its mix of resignation and wry precision. Syntax and metaphor are controlled, with rhythmic variation that suits both exposition and high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, almost rhapsodic texture that fits a “symphonically minded” scientist, and the polymer/river/music lexicon is consistent. Psychic distance is steady, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction veers toward ornate (“once-tangled polymer…align its chains in a symphonic whole”), risking a slight sameness of elevated register across beats. Still, the voice remains controlled and legible throughout, with clear temporal and focal anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and texturally distinctive, with recurring diction around glass, light, absence, and quantification tying the piece together. Occasional definitional intrusions (“Glimmering parole: the conditional release…”) flirt with expository register but still feel integrated into the story’s manifesto-like tone. Psychic distance is managed cleanly despite the abstract mode; we never head-hop or lose track of stance. Rhythms modulate well between more incantatory sentences and clipped, weighted lines like “Only as much as birth.”

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending professional specificity (“kneaded dough,” “analyzing its formation”) with metaphysical perception (“frozen sea-memory,” “sturdy, brittle heart”). Diction and rhythm fit this narrator’s sensibility—lyric but not academic—and modulate appropriately with pressure (sentences tighten around key beats like tasting the stalactite). There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; everything we know comes plausibly through his perceptions and inferences. The woman’s silence is used effectively to keep the lens firmly on him while still implying her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear rhythmic and imagistic signature (“under the hush of borrowed starlight”).

Dialogue fragments carry distinct idioms (German, Polish, Spanish) that reinforce character and theme without disrupting the overarching voice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the protagonist’s perception (“helix-minded,” “chaotically precise”), giving the piece a distinct texture. Recurrent phrasing (“quaking reverie,” “chaotically precise”) reads as deliberate patterning rather than accident, supporting the meditative cadence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance suits the speculative-lyric mode. At times, the elevated diction risks homogeneity of rhythm, but it doesn’t break control.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent slightly-lyric register suited to an archivist-mystic archetype. Diction around light, inversion, and thresholds forms a recognizable texture, and POV modesty is maintained. Some phrasing and imagery recur mechanically (“latent blaze,” “clandestinely luminous”), which slightly flattens the perceptual signature. Still, distance control and narrative stance remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in the sculptor’s sensibility yet able to pan out to the animals without jarring shifts. Rhythm and diction support the “intensely quiet” tone: sentences are musical without becoming opaque, and key moments (the first hum, the fox pausing) get clean emphasis. There’s a slight omniscient drift to notice distant creatures, but it feels deliberately orchestral rather than sloppy. Overall, the voice is distinctive and well-sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits a hyper-analytical, exiled chess tutor reading a magical nexus. Syntax and diction (e.g., “each gesture a calculated gambit”) have a distinct texture that feels like Kael’s mind and sustain through the piece. Psychic distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous explanatory narrator. At times, the lyricism risks a slight sameness of cadence, but it rarely dulls immediacy or confuses focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, with recurring phrases (“final stillness before fireworks ignite,” “shadowed workshop under stars”) functioning as intentional motifs rather than tics. Diction is elevated but controlled, matching the quasi-mystical attention to silence and frequency. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from interior listening to shared listening is smooth. A touch more idiosyncratic edge or abrasion in the voice under emotional pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and sensorially focused, with a clear fondness for organic metaphors and unusual phrases like “tide’s thought.” The diction is elevated but generally coherent with a mythic or fable-like mode, and POV distance remains consistent. At times, abstraction (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “river of fragrance and calm”) slightly blurs the immediacy and feels more authorial than character-particular. Even so, the prose has a recognizable texture and doesn’t suffer from head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with strong, rhythmic sentences and a distinctive lexicon (“sky-chamber,” “whirling silence,” “genetic grief”). POV boundaries are clean, and descriptive intensity generally tracks emotional beats, becoming more lyrical as Kael nears the core phenomenon. Occasional phrases drift toward essayistic abstraction, especially in the thematic summing-up, but they do not break the established stance. Overall, the narrative voice feels particular rather than generic and remains controlled under the story’s conceptual load.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sober, and professional, with an observational precision that suits an accident investigator. Diction is controlled and largely within the plausible register of a technical, detail-oriented mind, and the narrative distance stays stable. The “hazy precision” pattern of mood versus measurement is handled cleanly without head-hopping or stance confusion. While strong and appropriate, the voice stops short of feeling singularly idiosyncratic or unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, ritualistic frame, with consistent diction and no POV slippage. Synesthetic metaphors of sound and color give the narration a distinct texture. At times, repeated constructions (“sculpted hush,” “unfetter wonder”) verge on mannerism, but they don’t significantly damage clarity. Overall, the voice feels controlled and purposeful, if slightly over-declarative in thematic lines.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and sensorially rich without losing clarity; it feels plausibly tied to a contemplative, skilled keeper. Diction choices like “canyon hush,” “dust that glittered like forgotten stars,” and “a hallway of mirrors, each reflection a different sky” give the piece a distinct texture and rhythm. Psychic distance contracts and eases in appropriate places as his fear, awe, and resolve shift, with reflection usually well-anchored to concrete stimuli. The only constraint on a higher score is occasional over-explicit summarizing of realizations, which slightly blurs the otherwise strong alignment of voice and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct texture that merges mechanical, mathematical, and mystical registers in a way that fits Cassian’s mind. Diction is consistently elevated but not incongruous, and the narrative distance remains steady, giving a clear interior lens without head-hopping. The patterned phrasing around math and printing builds a recognizable rhythm that supports the accumulative design. Occasional explanatory sentences (“He believed it could transpose empathy…”) are serviceable rather than luminous but do not significantly undercut the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the magical-real mood, with some nice turns (“time thicken around him,” “her voice a thin thread lost in the wind”). The later zoom-out into communal myth and years-later summary is handled cleanly without confusing POV slippage. At times the diction drifts toward generic mystical phrasing (“heartbeat of the world,” “coax wonder”) rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Overall, the voice is polished and controlled, but not yet singular enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and clearly filtered through Seraphine’s hybrid mystic/empirical mind—technical terms sit naturally beside lyric description. Phrases like “shifted hush” and “each crystal a page” establish a distinct perceptual signature that carries through to the end. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscient leaps beyond what this kind of reflective third can plausibly claim. A mild essayistic tone in the thematic sentences fits the reflective mode, though it slightly smooths the immediacy in the final stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“silence grew thicker than the morning mist,” “compressed into something denser than time”) that fits Mei’s slow, ritualized existence. Psychic distance stays mostly close to Mei, with a purposeful zoom-out at the end to Lin that reads as an intentional, gentle omniscient touch rather than head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are cohesive and modulate with pressure, becoming slightly more incantatory during the weaving climax without losing clarity. The voice is singular and confident, if occasionally bordering on uniformly elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a quiet, mythic narrative, with controlled diction and a consistent perceptual filter rooted in Ren’s sensibility. Rhythm varies nicely between long, image-rich sentences and more clipped beats at decision points. While strong and polished, the voice feels more like a refined genre-fable narrator than a wholly singular, instantly unmistakable perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with some nice sensory touches tied to Lira’s profession (tasting “metallic memory of voyages”). Diction is mostly consistent and suitable for lyrical SF, and POV boundaries aren’t breached. That said, the narrative texture sometimes slides into generic genre-poetic phrasing and exposition, and mandated terms like “cyclically spontaneous” feel imposed rather than organic to her mental idiom. The voice is competent and readable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gentle, and slightly lyrical, matching Caleb’s temperament and the maritime setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with recurring phrasing (“luminescent ache,” “feeling of safety”) working more as motif than crutch, though they edge toward overuse. POV modesty is sound; we never leave Caleb’s knowledge or perception. The voice is pleasant and distinctive enough for publication but could risk a bit more idiosyncrasy to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate to the mythic tone, with clean handling of tense and perspective. Diction is largely consistent and avoids jarring register shifts, and the cadences of the declarative lines support the fable-like feel. However, the voice lacks a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature—it could belong to many mythic-fantasy narrators—and relies on repeated turns of phrase (“shadowed elation,” “accidentally prophetic”) instead of more individuated textures. It’s very solid but not yet distinctive enough for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinct, with a clear perceptual signature centered on color, light, and liminality; diction and rhythm are largely controlled. Occasional lines of dialogue are simple but effective, with the stranger’s speech carrying a deliberately wind-like, oracular quality that matches her function. The narrative distance modulates appropriately between tactile craft detail and more conceptual reflection without losing track of the present frame. There is a mild drift into abstract, essayistic register at key thematic moments, but it doesn’t break POV logic so much as dull edge.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with recurring textures like “salt and stardust” giving it a distinct flavor. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and the narrative distance is stable and appropriate to this quiet, contemplative fantasy. The prose modulates with the scene—hushed in the corridors, more humming and charged in the tower—without losing coherence. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helper” narration undercutting the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a coherent mythic distance that suits the material, and there’s no POV slippage. Phrasing like “a jigsaw of stars that had forgotten their constellations” establishes a distinct texture and rhythm. At times, the diction leans into familiar poetic constructions and repeats motifs in similar cadences, which flattens the uniqueness of the voice a bit. Overall, it’s controlled and fitting, but not yet at the level of truly singular, unmistakable narrative music.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suits the contemplative, slightly mystical tone of the piece. Phrases like “enlarged tranquility,” “matryoshka dolls of meaning,” and “staying while leaving” give the prose a distinct texture and pattern. At times, that patterning edges toward self-consciousness and repetition, but it remains legible and emotionally aligned with Mira’s sensibility. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature—phrases like “heuristically gentle rebellion” and “a yew tree that kept its own counsel” feel of a piece. Rhythm and diction are well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences matching the meditative tone without losing clarity. POV remains stable around Mara, with occasional omniscient-leaning generalizations that fit the essayistic-lyric mode. The voice is strong and memorable enough for high-band, even if it flirts with abstraction in a few thematic sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriate to the contemplative mode, with a consistent lexicon around light, vows, and oblivion. There is no POV slippage, and the narrative distance stays steady. That said, the diction often feels generalized and repetitive, with phrases like “edge of oblivion,” “luminous vows,” and “quartz hush” reused rather than modulated to track pressure. The voice has texture but lacks the sharper, character-specific perceptual signature expected at top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is consistent, textured, and confidently lyric, with recurring sound and time imagery giving it a clear signature. Diction is elevated but feels plausible for this narrator and stays stable under pressure, avoiding register slips. The narrative distance holds close while allowing reflective cadences that deepen rather than flatten the present-tense stakes. There is no head-hopping or confusing stance shift, and the modulation from ominous observation to tense action back to quiet reflection is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built around taste, memory, and quasi-scientific metaphors. POV distance remains stable in a close third, and the few lines of dialogue feel natural, distinct, and goal-driven, advancing both exposition and thematic pressure. Rhythms modulate well between dense, image-rich sentences and cleaner declarative lines, especially toward the end. Occasionally the diction edges toward self-conscious lyricism, but it rarely undercuts clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical register that suits an introspective, artist protagonist. Diction (“auroral sorrow,” “uncork suppressed creativity”) is elevated but mostly in character and supports the tone. There’s no POV slippage or artificial exposition, and the narrative distance stays steady. Some phrasing and concepts repeat in a way that flattens the voice’s distinctiveness slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-matched to a calligrapher protagonist and a fragile greenhouse world. Diction and imagery (gold leaf, parchment skin, bruised sky) create a distinct perceptual flavor without major register slips. The narrative distance stays stable, with smooth integration of interior perception and external action. It stops short of a truly idiosyncratic, unforgettable voice, but it’s controlled and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, sustained, and well-matched to the mythic, post-linguistic premise, with a distinct texture in its long, sinuous sentences and careful diction. POV distance is consistent—hovering in a close-omniscient halo around the bell tuner without head-hopping—and the register never jars against the invented world. Rhythmic modulation at key moments (the child’s arrival, the final laugh “like breaking ice”) effectively sharpens focus. The voice is elevated but not so self-conscious as to collapse into self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and stable, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in the android’s hybrid materiality (“ceramic joints,” “processors split into fragments”). Diction and imagery modulate with pressure—the magnetic drift and static produce denser, more fractured phrases, then calm as the fears miniaturize. There’s no head-hopping; access remains firmly within the caretaker’s consciousness, even when conveying Emma’s memories via objects. The lyricism feels intentional rather than generic, and the narrative stance never breaks into authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with occasional gentle omniscience but no disorienting head-hopping. Diction leans lyrical but mostly stays controlled and accessible, with some strong images (“bouquets of gossip like offerings,” “sandstorm calm”) giving the narrative a distinct texture. Dialogue, when used, is spare and functional, if not especially idiosyncratic. A few lines slip into slogan-like abstraction, but overall the voice feels unified and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with controlled, often striking imagery (e.g., “each line a dance step, each step a key to a cipher”). Diction and rhythm match the eerie, submerged setting and Lyra’s identity as a “lyrical code-breaker,” and there’s no POV leakage or confusion. The voice modulates gently from claustrophobic to exalted as she rises toward the surface while maintaining a unified texture. At times the narration leans a bit toward generalized statement, but not enough to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, textured, and clearly filtered through Kael’s perceptions, with recurring attention to tools, weight, and harbor minutiae that feel character-specific. Lyricism is controlled and confident, with rhythm modulating appropriately between exposition, movement, and the chamber’s heightened strangeness. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even the more abstract sentences remain grounded in concrete experience. A hair more syntactic variation in a couple of dense descriptive stretches would make the music of the prose nearly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with striking diction (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze,” “paper vessels holding back a tide of unwanted tomorrows”) that suits a ritualistic, contemplative mode. The perceptual filter feels particular to someone who lives by listening to silences and codes, and the syntax modulates appropriately between flowing, image-rich lines and slightly tighter beats at key turns. A few phrases repeat (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze”) and the register stays uniformly elevated, which can start to feel mannered rather than strictly character-rooted. Nonetheless, POV control is clean and the voice is distinct and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice, filtered through Alex, maintains a consistent, slightly bookish lyricism that fits both character and subject. Mrs. Voss’s dialogue is distinct, precise, and thematically loaded (“Dead languages were my trade,” “every restoration is a negotiation with ghosts”). The narrative rhythm moves smoothly between concrete observation and conceptual metaphor without losing clarity. A few lines risk feeling writerly rather than strictly character-bound, but they’re controlled and coherent with the established style.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and character-appropriate, seamlessly blending scientific lexicon (“resonance structures,” “equations”) with lush, mystical imagery. Elara’s perceptual signature—trying to rationalize magic with technical language—feels distinct and gives the prose texture and coherence. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentence length modulating effectively around key beats like kneeling and listening. Occasionally the abstraction level rises a bit high, but it remains legible and in character rather than slipping into generic philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the sacred, covert mood, with a distinct sensory signature (pearl light, marble, dripping stalactites, ink and roses). Diction is elevated but coherent for the world and never feels like head-hopping or register drift. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between exterior detail and interior stakes without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself is confident and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, with a consistent sonic palette and recurring phrasing that creates a recognizable texture. The diction (e.g., “serpentine nexus,” “reed-blown melancholy,” “webs of intrigue”) is controlled and largely aligned with the story’s mythic, musical register. There is occasional register flatness where the voice slips into explanatory or thesis-like sentences that feel less embodied. Still, the POV never leaks, and the narrative stance remains coherent and confident from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear, lyrical texture that suits the material and maintains stable focalization through Maya. Diction like “borrowed starlight” and “windows of connection” feels patterned rather than random, giving the piece a recognizable cadence. There’s no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge outside Maya’s plausible grasp. The risk is slight over-reliance on a few favorite phrases, but it doesn’t materially blur the POV or undercut the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent and confident, with patterned diction that suits a contemplative fable. Phrasing like “as if stirring the very air into a quiet tea” and “demure audacity” gives the narration a distinct texture. That said, some repetitions (the whisk–air–tea image reappears almost verbatim) and abstract formulations slightly flatten the voice’s freshness over time. POV remains stable and legible, with no head-hopping or register jolts.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature built around noticing patterns and anomalies (“collected these anomalies like other men collected rainwater”). Diction and rhythm suit a thoughtful, analytical survivor without drifting into sterile exposition; the bureaucratic and technical terms (pre-liberation, liquidation, gamma rays) feel consistent with his trade. POV is stable, with no leakage or artificial withholding; exposition arises naturally from what Elias would infer. The lack of dialogue removes one avenue for vocal contrast but also keeps the tone taut and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice has a clear, confident lyric texture—densely metaphorical, with consistent diction and rhythm that match the quasi-mythic SF mood. POV is stable and close enough to Atlas to feel personal while still allowing a mythic vantage in the coda. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and the narrative modulation from storm-night immediacy to legendary summarization is controlled. At times, elevated language feels authorial rather than distinctly Atlas’s mind, slightly flattening the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically assured and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“melody that tasted of honey and rust,” “jellyfish victims swept ashore”) that feels tied to this character’s sensibility. Rhythm and syntax vary well, balancing lush imagery with clean narrative movement, and the accumulative, fairy-tale-adjacent stance fits the fable-like stakes. Occasional overt thematic statements lean toward authorial rather than character-filtered diction but do not fundamentally break POV control. Overall, the voice is distinctive and confident enough for high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent signature: technical yet mythic, filtered through someone who genuinely thinks in terms of frequency, resonance, and instruments. Diction and imagery (e.g., “unburied grief and saltwater corpses,” “sorrow’s geometry”) feel unified rather than stitched, and shifts in rhythm track the scene’s emotional peaks well. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; even the drowned keeper’s relief is conveyed through her perception of light and vibration. The lyric compression is confident and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture, blending technical terms (“magnetic flux,” “lunar azimuth”) with sensuous, mythic phrasing in a way that feels unified to Elara’s specialized, contemplative mind. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with repeated phrases (“softly purposeful,” “unyoke”) operating as deliberate motifs rather than tics. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative confidence about world rules matches what this kind of expert observer could plausibly know. The modulation under pressure remains measured and clear, supporting the theme of restrained wildness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s professional detail-focus and inherited stories. Diction is mostly well controlled, with a measured, solemn rhythm that fits the subject and underground setting. Some phrases feel more like the author’s conceptual language than Mara’s (“controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”), which nudges the voice toward a generalized literary register. Even so, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance holds effectively through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a controlled, almost liturgical cadence that suits a chaplain’s perspective. POV remains coherent, with only light, plausible insight into Marlowe that doesn’t break focalization. Recurring phrases (“vibrant hush,” “aptly deliberate”) and the controlled rhythm give the piece a recognizable texture. Occasionally the register drifts toward overt authorial essaying, but not enough to disrupt the underlying voice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and strongly textured, blending technical registers (“evolving codebase,” “recursive loop”) with mythic phrasing (“tongue of a god whispering in gear-language”). Zephyr’s perceptual signature—steadily curious, wry, delighted by the “completely unnecessary”—pervades the narration. The lyric compression and occasional abstraction feel taught early and remain legible through closure. With slightly more modulation into embodied immediacy at peak beats, it could edge into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and cohesive, with a consistent lyrical, slightly solemn diction that suits the subject. Refrains like “ghosts,” “echo of forgotten songs,” and the number string create a recognizable texture. However, the voice sometimes drifts toward template-poetic phrasing rather than an idiosyncratic, character-specific idiom, and the rhythm can feel monotone in its solemnity. Even so, POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a calm, incantatory rhythm that matches Kael’s “calmly intuitive” nature and the story’s contemplative mode. Repetition of phrases like “weighted breath before reply” reads as deliberate patterning rather than artifact, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. Occasional generalized statements feel a bit essayistic but do not break POV coherence or emotional texture. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and distinctive without sliding into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the introspective, accumulative design. Diction (“windborne solace,” “a quiet folding of light”) carries a distinct tonal signature without sliding into academic or clinical registers that would break POV plausibility. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, though there is some reliance on similar “She [verb]...” sentence openings. No head-hopping or stance confusion undermines clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and largely well-controlled, with a warm observational register that suits the sentinel’s role as caretaker. Recurrent phrases (“gently persuasive,” “intersubjective understanding”) and occasional academic diction slightly jar against the otherwise earthy, sensory texture. Still, the narrative stance remains coherent, with no head-hopping or distance slips, and the rhythm of sentences supports the quiet, accumulative mode. With a bit of lexical pruning and more individuated idiom, the voice could approach top-tier distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, incantatory tone that fits the mystical setting. Diction is mostly controlled, though it tends toward uniform elevation and repetition (“murmuring pavilion,” “whisperfield calm,” “strangely honest”) rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays fairly external, offering little nuanced interior modulation as stakes rise. Overall, it’s competent and coherent but not distinctly character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient-leaning third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in its mingling of industrial imagery and pastoral softness. Rhythms are varied and sentences generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without losing clarity. The narrative distance feels intentionally steady—closer to fable than intimate interior monologue—and that stance suits the communal scope. There is minimal dialogue, but the brief exchange with the child is clean and in keeping with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s bookish sensibility and nostalgia. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between calm description and heightened moments (e.g., the devastating “nothing” when he speaks his name). Lexicon and tone match both character and milieu, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shift. Occasionally, the abstract register edges toward essayistic, but it remains anchored enough in image and specific perception to feel like character-inflected narration rather than authorial override.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and clearly anchored in the prophet’s perception, with recurring motifs (“tidal,” “echo,” “hush”) giving the prose a distinctive signature. Diction and rhythm are well controlled, with enough variation in sentence length to keep the piece from droning despite its meditative mode. The voice comfortably carries both sensory detail and metaphysical musing without obvious register clashes. Occasional expository thematic statements are the only moments that feel a bit outside the otherwise finely tuned tone.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent contemplative, quasi-mystical tone that suits the material and never breaks POV with clumsy exposition. Rhythmic, patterned phrasing (“luminous ache,” “ephemeral whisper”) gives the piece a recognizable texture, even if it occasionally verges on incantatory repetition. The lack of dialogue is appropriate to the solitary, meditative frame and does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Elara is steady and assured, with a consistent lyric texture that suits the subject. Diction choices like “hymning the mundane” and “pulsing stillness” create a recognizable signature, and the narration mostly stays within a plausible, slightly elevated sensibility for this character. There are a few lightly omniscient-feeling statements about what hope “is” or how the hospice “remained” that broaden beyond her perspective, but they don’t break coherence. Rhythmically, the prose has good cadence, though it leans on a similar register from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a calm, precise narrative voice that fits a meticulous scholar. Diction is consistent and clear; there are no perspective slips or unjustified knowledge leaps. The voice, though competent, leans more neutral-lyric than sharply idiosyncratic, with limited distinctive quirks in perception or rhythm. Under stress, the voice remains uniformly composed, which fits characterization but slightly flattens intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with an academic-lyric texture that fits a forensic folklorist (“folklore forensics,” “structural truth,” “conceptual repricing” implied). Moira’s dialogue has a different cadence—plainer but edged with quiet authority—so the two voices remain distinct without feeling contrived. Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately as pressure increases, especially around the reveal of Clara and Elena’s confession about her motives. A slight tendency toward aphoristic lines at the end nudges the register toward essayistic, but not enough to break POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mira’s contemplative perception of tides, light, and mist. Rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent, with no POV leakage or jarring register shifts. That said, the voice modulates little across the piece; pressure and serenity are narrated in almost the same cadence, softening peaks that might benefit from sharper texture or compression. The absence of dialogue keeps the tone unified but also limits opportunities for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly rooted in Elara’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature (tech infrastructure reimagined through organic and temporal metaphors). Syntax and rhythm vary nicely between longer, imagistic sentences and tighter, declarative ones, matching the contemplative mode. Diction stays coherent—elevated but believable for a thoughtful tech worker turned caretaker—and there’s no POV leakage or artificial exposition. A few metaphors (“green memories,” “honeyed hush”) are reused near the line where they risk feeling writerly, but they remain thematically functional.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinctive texture built from recurring phrases and spiraling syntax that matches the subject matter. Psychic distance is steady; we remain inside the novelist’s awareness without head-hopping, even as images grow more abstract. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction fits the metaphysical frame. At times the register leans toward generalized abstraction, but it doesn’t break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well controlled, with consistent diction that suits the fable-like tone. Sentences vary in rhythm enough to avoid monotony, and there are no POV slips or awkward expository intrusions. While the narration feels more like an elegant omniscient storyteller than Elara’s highly specific consciousness, this stance is coherent. It’s competent and pleasant rather than singularly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture that fits the fable-like premise. Diction is cohesive and filtered through the alchemist’s ritualistic, symbol-attuned sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between concrete actions and slightly elevated reflection. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative rhythm supports the sense of held, then releasing, breath.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature tied to the locksmith’s oblique, peripheral way of seeing. Diction and rhythm suit the quasi-mythic, speculative tone and rarely jar. Occasional abstraction and explanatory phrasing (e.g., “These were the echoes, he realized…”) flatten some moments that could have stayed in image. Overall, though, the narrative stance is controlled and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by the weaver’s sensibility as a maker of patterns. Diction (“warp and weft,” “threads of light,” “acoustic folds”) feels native to her worldview rather than generic poeticism, and the narrative distance is stable. Rhythm varies well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter declarative turns at key beats (“The first burden was her daughter's voice, lost to time”). There’s mild risk of uniform high-register solemnity, but it suits the mode and does not blur POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and recognizably Mara’s, with a strong preference for sensory-laden metaphors (“mane that curled like smoke,” “color that tasted like old copper and warmth”). Psychic distance is well-managed, staying close enough to her perceptions without drifting into omniscience. There are occasional expository intrusions (“The method was simple:”) and repeated phrasing that slightly flatten the otherwise distinctive rhythm. Overall, the voice is controlled and character-specific enough to carry the piece in a prestigious venue with some tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    First-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly colored by the scavenger’s sensibility (attention to fragments, erosion, maps, and broken objects). Diction and syntax are controlled and cohesive; the surreal world feels fully natural to this narrator’s perceptions. There is good modulation—moments like spinning the wheel or seeing the ghost clearly tighten rhythm without losing coherence. At times, the register verges on uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens dynamic range, but it remains effective and character-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable and well controlled, with a distinctive, mildly technical lyricism that fits a civil-engineer protagonist (“network of latent flows—air, power, data”). The diction and metaphoric palette are coherent and motif-driven (flows, code, navigation), and psychic distance stays consistent. At times, the narration drifts into abstract or thesis-like phrasing that feels more authorial than fully embedded in Mira’s consciousness. Still, the overall tonal and rhythmic control is strong and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, blending Elara’s sensibility with a slightly elevated narrative diction that suits the fable-like tone. Syntax and rhythm are varied and often musical, with controlled repetition (“excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial hush”) creating a recognizable cadence. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains stable, modulating gently with emotional intensity. A few abstract or thesis-like sentences slightly dilute the otherwise strong perceptual signature but don’t break control.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, mildly ornate lyricism that suits the contemplative quest. Phrasing like “architecture of lies,” “hindsight clarity,” and “serene upheaval” establishes a recognizable idiom and conceptual preoccupations. At times the register drifts toward abstract or recycled constructions (“her thoughts, thoughtfully clear”) that feel more like authorial labeling than character-specific perception. Overall the POV is stable and legible but could use sharper, more idiosyncratic turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility (e.g., noticing “oceanic hush,” thinking of seeds as lineages, rope as text). Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied, with a distinct texture that fits the quiet, mythic tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Kessler’s few lines are voice-distinct (“beach-glass witchery,” “gravelly but not unkind”). There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience; reflective passages stay anchored in present sensory cues.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is stable, lyrical, and well-controlled, with consistent diction and rhythm suited to a reflective, solitary scribe. The focalization remains cleanly with her perceptions and inner framing, with no head-hopping or register jolts. Patterned phrasing (e.g., recurring constructions around presence and absence) feels intentional rather than mechanical. Overall, the narrative stance feels confidently singular and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to a prince-scientist dreaming in a steampunk cavern; diction like “stalactite core” and “starlight-infused silk” feels coherent with his worldview. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with a recognizable cadenced style that holds through the story and swells appropriately around the hatching scene. At times, the narration veers toward over-articulation of concepts (“flawed genesis,” “hybrid vitality”) that sounds more like thematic exposition than lived perception, slightly thinning the character-specific feel of the voice. Still, POV control is solid, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct: lyrical, image-heavy, and keyed to Maya’s sensory and emotional experience. Diction is consistent, and the recurring phrases (obsidian lagoon, kelp-drift peace, scars singing) create a deliberate, recognizable texture. At times, the narration lapses into slightly generic uplift or repetition of structures (“She imagined… She imagined…”, “She had…” sequences), which flattens rhythm. Overall the POV control is good and publishable, if not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: it favors luminous, quasi-mythic imagery (“last embers of a star,” “sidereal patience,” “liquid light”). There is good rhythmic control and variation at the sentence level, and psychic distance stays steady; we never head-hop or drop into exposition-heavy explanation. A few phrases repeat or tilt toward over-articulation (“defiant hush” is explicitly named and then reused), but they read as motif rather than artifact. Overall, the voice feels deliberate and unified, if a bit safe in its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct texture of cosmic and computational imagery that feels unified rather than generic. Phrasing like “mathematical elegies,” “approximated infinity in its recursive bloom,” and “she became the question and the answer” shows strong rhythmic and lexical control. There are a few instances where abstractions cluster (“gear-derived wisdom approximated infinity”) that skim toward density at the cost of emotional immediacy, but they don’t derail clarity. Overall, the perceptual signature is memorable and stable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the meditative subject matter, with consistent diction and controlled rhythm. Images like “their orange wings flickering like candle flames against the fading glass” and “their collective weight bending light into something like a prayer” show a distinct perceptual signature. POV distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts, even as time is compressed across weeks. A small amount of repeated syntactic structure and explanatory phrasing in thematic lines keeps it from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive: technically informed by clockwork, morally attentive, and sensuously attuned to glass, tide, and metal. Diction and syntax hold a controlled lyricism that suits “searing reverie” without sliding into vagueness, and the narrative distance remains stable in Elara’s perceptions. Patterned phrases like “measured absolution in ticks and tocks” feel character-rooted rather than ornamental. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts despite the elevated style.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes,” “shape of intentions”) that suits the contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, and there’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Still, some phrasing drifts into abstraction and repetition (the duplicated “weaver’s fingers” sentence, recurring set phrases) that flatten the distinctiveness of the voice. Strong, but not yet razor-sharp or surprising enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a confident, quasi-mythic register that suits the speculative setting and conceptual focus. Diction like “groundedly imaginative” and “predictive modeling” meshes surprisingly well with the fantasy texture, signaling a distinct perceptual world. Psychic distance is well managed; we remain close enough to Kaelen to feel her cognitive process without head-hopping. Occasionally, the expository abstraction of her modeling slightly flattens immediacy, but it never breaks the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture rooted in Mira’s sensory focus on ink, glow, and dust. Diction and rhythm are consistent and controlled, with recurring phrases functioning as motif rather than accident. The narrative stance stays within what Mira can perceive and infer; there’s no head-hopping or clumsy exposition. At times the lyric mode verges on sameness of cadence, but not enough to blur clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled, image-rich sentences that match the meditative mode. Diction is largely stable and character-appropriate for a reflective artist, and the patterned repetitions (“somber marvel,” “mirage,” “vanishing point”) feel intentional rather than accidental. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays steady. Some phrasing trends toward uniform solemnity, which slightly flattens modulation across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and well matched to a philosophically minded scavenger; diction like “stratigraphic maps” and “thermal fracturing coefficients” feels organically character-bound. Rhythm varies nicely between dense descriptive clauses and clipped, declarative beats in tense moments (“Malach didn’t flinch, his calm as abrasive as the brick dust in his throat.”). Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character—Malach’s “This is what happened… just the math of how cities drown” encapsulates his stance without breaking register. No head-hopping or distance slippage undermines the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically omniscient but stable, with a consistent diction and rhythm that suit the reflective, accumulative design. Phrases like “traveled stillness” and “patterns of absence that let humanity breathe” give the narrative a distinctive texture without drifting into incoherence. Psychic distance is well managed as it moves from scene to long-term summary, and there’s no head-hopping despite the broad lens. The one tradeoff is that the elevated register occasionally risks feeling more authorial than character-bound, though it remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrically consistent, with strong metaphors and a clear perceptual signature oriented around taste, plants, and memory. Third-person close focusing on Mara never slips, and the elevated diction suits the fable-like tone. The introduction of terms like “synaptic plasticity” blends surprisingly well with the otherwise organic imagery, though it does flirt with register mismatch. Overall, the rhythm and texture feel deliberate and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends Mara’s grounded workaday world with a mythic, honey/light vocabulary. Phrasing like “nectar dusk light, the kind that turns ordinary wires into threads of honey” and “the darkness tastes like honey now” feels both stylistically unified and character-appropriate in this lightly-magical milieu. There are no POV leaks or stance wobbles; the narrative distance stays close enough to feel intimate without collapsing into confessional first person. A slight tendency toward explicitly summarizing insight at the end prevents this from feeling utterly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently omniscient, and carries a distinctive, incantatory rhythm that suits the contemplative premise. Phrasings like “streetlights daydream” and “shard of hush” give the piece a recognizable texture, and the distance is consistent. At the same time, the voice tends toward a single register, with similar sentence lengths and repeated constructions that can feel monotonous. There’s little modulation between beats, so peaks and troughs blur tonally.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that feels aligned with Petra’s stony, ancient consciousness and the submerged setting. Diction (“incisively kind,” “crushing clarity,” “the city’s forgotten doubt”) is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature and no head-hopping. Rhythm is varied and confident, sustaining a high-density style without collapsing into confusion. A few abstract formulations flirt with over-explication, but the overall voice is strong enough for publication at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a nicely calibrated intellectual yet haunted tone that fits a mathematically minded father trapped in a metaphysical construct. Phrases like “cosmic indifference” and “corrupted pixel in reality’s fabric” feel character-appropriate and help individualize perception. There’s good rhythmic control and modulation near key beats (dice rolls, rupture discovery, final refusal) without over-explaining. Occasionally the narration edges toward essayistic (“perfect symmetry always concealed one fatal flaw”), but this generally aligns with his analytic mentality rather than breaking POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and recurring motifs like “saffron quiet” and “waxing moon’s glow” that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic tone and Kael’s contemplative perspective, and POV distance remains stable without leakage. There is good modulation—longer, flowing sentences for atmosphere, tighter ones around key turns (the mural, Mira’s recognition, the ripple). A faint tendency toward repeated constructions and phrases keeps it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and credibly aligned with a historically-minded guide who thinks in images, relics, and rituals. Diction and cadence are controlled, with recurring phrases (“rosewater scent/dread,” “fragile hope”) creating a deliberate incantatory feel rather than scattered purple prose. There’s no dialogue to test range, but internal focalization stays coherent and free of head-hopping. At peak emotional beats, the voice holds steady rather than modulating much, which flattens intensity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear textural signature (recurrent sea/breath/light metaphors and slightly archaic cadence) that suits the mythic mood. POV control is stable; we remain essentially aligned with the clock maker’s experience, with occasional wider framing that still feels of a piece. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and key moments (“The hunger stone shuddered, its dark surface cracking…”) land with clarity. A slight tendency toward repeated diction and thematic phrasing keeps it just short of top-tier distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on light, residue, and paradox. The advisor’s diction, dream-dictionary excerpts, and narrative texture all harmonize tonally, creating a unified, slightly oracular register. Occasionally the narration edges into overt abstraction or essay-like phrasing, but it remains broadly plausible for an introspective, traumatized protagonist with time to think rather than mid-action breathlessness. POV control is tight: no head-hopping, clear internal access, and well-managed psychic distance through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture with a clear perceptual signature: attention to geometry, sound-as-math, and atmospheric nuance feels particular to this prophet. Diction like “restless euphony,” “foam geometry,” and “fractal heart” is elevated but coherent with the world, and there’s no POV leakage or stance confusion. The cadence varies enough that the accumulation of metaphors feels like design rather than noise. Limited interior access keeps us slightly outside her emotional core, but that’s more a characterization choice than a POV flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility, with repeated attention to spirals, shells, and pattern-language giving it a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm stay controlled and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, without slipping into jarring registers. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation toward the ending is smooth rather than over-explanatory, despite a slight increase in abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and mildly elevated, matching a reflective historian-narrator stance. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and key phrases (“rescue truth from a pit of lies,” parallels between station and memory) create a recognizable texture. At times the diction edges into thesis-statement territory, where the narrative sounds more like an essay than a pressured consciousness, slightly flattening immediacy. Still, point of view remains stable and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s profession and temperament, blending technical terms (“hydraulic lime,” “firm shore surveyor”) with poetic perception. Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive sentences and shorter, declarative moves at turning points (“These were the relics of abandoned dreams, the archaeology he hadn't known he was seeking.”). There’s no head-hopping and no dialogue to test, but the narrative idiom feels singular rather than generic. A few abstract phrasings (“commerce of hope,” “ambition’s sediment”) skate near high-register generality, but they mostly fit the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-matched to a meticulous archivist in a fantastical ruin. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent, and the recurring phrasing (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve”) creates a recognizable sonic pattern, though it borders on overuse. POV control is clean with no slippage or helpful-narrator intrusions undermining focalization. The voice is distinct enough to be memorable without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled, consistent, and clearly aligned with the lantern maker’s obsessions—attention narrows to glass, light, breath, and memory in a way that feels character-specific. Rhythm and diction are deliberate, with recurring phrases (“descending while ascending,” “luminous torment”) working as patterned motifs rather than accidental repetition. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the distance stays stable while allowing occasional conceptual lift. The only reservation is that in a few spots the narration sounds slightly more like an external essaying of theme than pure interior filter, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is distinct and controlled, blending technical language (“perturbation sequences,” “quantum imprints”) with charged, haunted imagery in a way that feels character-specific for a traumatized scientist-observer. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively between taut, procedural moments and lyrical reflection without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrative certainty stays within Kael’s plausible knowledge. A few abstract formulations skirt the edge of authorial essaying, but they don’t quite tip the voice out of her established register.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinctive lyrical-scientific texture that marries technical terms (“astrographic sensors,” “waveform of emotional resonance”) to image-driven metaphors. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a competent, observant pilot in a slightly elevated register. The narration does slip into a more omniscient, essayistic tone at times (“Some truths are too bright for mortal eyes”), but this is stylistically aligned with the piece’s speculative-literary ambitions rather than feeling like register drift. No head-hopping or POV confusion occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct fondness for metaphor and patterning that fits the reflective mode. Diction generally matches a contemplative, educated sensibility and sustains mood without head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrases drift toward generic or workshop-lyrical (“constant companion,” “quiet scar of a lesson learned”), slightly diluting the otherwise specific texture. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear, but not fully singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits the ritualized, diplomatic frame. The prose registers as observant and calm, matching Kael’s temperament, and psychic distance is well controlled—neither too remote nor intrusive. Moments like “a tactile reminder that even the smallest hinge could swing wide a heavy door” show a distinct, if not radical, perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional and tonally consistent with the hush and gravity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly shaded by a seaman’s sensibility without drifting into omniscient commentary. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with image-rich clauses in reflective moments and cleaner beats at points of decision. The narrator’s perceptual signature—seeing poles as sentinels, tides as gravity—is distinct and stable. No head-hopping or stance confusion intrudes on the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice has some texture (“delicately robust,” “jaded wonder”) and maintains a coherent, slightly lyrical register. At times, diction trends toward stock formulations and repeated constructions, which keeps the voice from feeling truly singular or surprising. Still, control is solid and the modulation from subterranean awe to surface resolve reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently handles a high level of poetic imagery without losing basic clarity. Diction (“cosmic intimacy,” “permanent moonlight,” “infinite twilight”) is consistent with the fairy-tale/mythic register and modulates gently as pressure increases. There’s no head-hopping or POV leakage, and the distance remains appropriately close to her emotional experience. The main constraint is that the voice, while polished, feels more like a generalized lyric narrator than a sharply individualized consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and confident, marrying occult diction with intimate bodily awareness (“porcelain gleaming with the cruelty of perfect memory,” “her skin…was the true tablecloth”). POV distance is stable, close third with reliably character-bound perceptions; there’s no leakage or unexplained certainty beyond her experience. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with long, lush sentences balanced by shorter, declarative turns at key realizations (“The crack in the saucer was her own body now, opened and luminous”). The lyric pattern is taught from the first line and sustained without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and coherent, blending spiritual lexicon with SF texture in a way that feels like Maya’s own consciousness. The narrative distance remains stable, with her perceptions (gravity readings, tears, Li’s ghost) filtering the world consistently. Occasional terms like “shadow work” and slightly expository thematic statements brush against a more essayistic register but don’t break POV control. Rhythm and syntax mostly modulate well with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, with a strong perceptual signature around physics, coincidence, and sensory detail. Occasional zoom-outs to explain offstage consequences read as controlled omniscient inflections rather than leaks, and the stance remains coherent through to closure. Rhythm and diction are well handled, with varied sentence lengths and a confident cadence that fits this mythic, reflective mode. There is minor risk of over-smooth, authorial-sounding abstraction in thematic sentences, but not enough to truly disturb POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-matched to a meticulous sentinel reading mechanism and shadow. Diction like “winking hush,” “cradle of sparks,” and “intrigue had coated the fort…like rust” gives the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance remains consistent, with just enough interior coloring to feel character-specific. There is room for more modulation under peak pressure, but control and cohesion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Elara and carries a distinct, incantatory texture (“foam whispering secrets of ancient eels,” “each future glimpse a shard of glass”). Diction and imagery are controlled and coherent with the metaphysical, ritualistic frame, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing shifts. Rhythm is generally well-managed, with longer, lush sentences suited to the meditative, accumulative pressure. It could benefit from a few sharper, plainer beats around the climactic choice to vary cadence and emphasize stakes, but the overall voice is strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in the poet’s consciousness, with a strong perceptual signature—time measured by a darkroom timer, scars understood as geography, timetables as ghost maps. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled; long, flowing sentences fit the meditative mode, with occasional shorter beats (“The poet smiled, a rare gesture”) for emphasis. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator’s lexicon and imagery feel plausible for a reflective, intellectually inclined poet. A few repeated constructions (“storm-kissed wonder,” reiterated map metaphors) flirt with self-conscious patterning but mostly read as purposeful motif rather than accidental echo.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person POV is stable and filtered through Rhen’s sensibility, with a mildly elevated, almost fable-like diction that suits a “dueling philosopher.” Phrases like “dignified chaos” and “dance of intellect and steel” have some texture, though they are familiar. There’s no dialogue to test voice differentiation, and interior access stays relatively shallow and declarative. Overall, the voice is clean and consistent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly biased toward the poet’s sensibility, with nice rhythmic control in lines like “each page a petal of defiance.” Recurrent diction around rust, light, and blooming creates a coherent sonic and imagistic palette. There is no head-hopping, and distance remains consistent, with controlled shifts toward modest omniscience. At times the lyric register edges close to uniformity, but overall the voice feels confident and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature favoring mechanical/temporal objects and atmospheric shifts. Rhythm and diction are controlled, leaning poetic without substantial confusion, and psychic distance stays relatively steady. There is no dialogue to test, but internal access and narrative stance cohere. A few phrases feel slightly abstracted or familiar, yet overall the voice feels particular to this character and world rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctively colored by Kael’s empirical/whimsical mindset (“spectrograph for colors that shouldn’t exist,” “equation-white to story-gold”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a gentle lyricism that suits the speculative premise and never slips into alien register. The narrative distance stays steady and character-bound, with no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts. Compression and patterned phrasing feel deliberate rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent preference for metaphor and ritual-inflected diction that suits Mara’s contemplative state and Hideo’s influence. Repetitions such as “rhythmically placid” and the recurring color/tide language create a deliberate pattern rather than read as tics. Dialogue is sparse but natural within the stylized frame, and Hideo’s speech rhythm matches his described demeanor. The high, polished register occasionally approaches authorial rather than strictly character-bound narration, but the stance remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice successfully blends scientific lexicon ("spectrometers," "supernova") with lyrical observation, maintaining a consistent and character-specific filter. The shift from clinical detachment to integrated acceptance is reflected in the rhythm of the sentences without breaking the established POV.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is filtered and distant, relying on "Kael realized," "Kael understood," and "Kael felt" constructions that distance the reader. The tone is monotonously reverent and overwrought, lacking modulation or distinct character idiom. There is no unique perceptual signature; the voice feels generic and algorithmically smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, maintaining a summary-like remove throughout. The dissonance between the lyrical tone ("winterglass," "gulls") and the sci-fi/technical terminology ("heat-mapping," "signatures") disrupts the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and elevated tone suitable for the genre. There is a slight tendency toward overwrought phrasing ("wrinkles of silt and sorrow"), but the narrative stance remains stable and the internal texture aligns well with the protagonist's weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is distant and fable-like, frequently drifting into omniscient generalizations ("community's heartbeat," "spirits carried a new resonance") that distance the reader from Mara's specific experience. The tone is consistent but monotonous, lacking modulation for tension.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered through poetic abstraction and "purple" descriptors ("ghostly whispers," "filmstrip unspooling"). This heavy filtering creates distance, prioritizing pretty phrasing over immediate, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a suitable mythic quality, but the psychic distance is often too great, favoring explanation over immersion. The narrative tends to interpret the protagonist's perceptions for the reader ("not a lens but a trap") instead of allowing the imagery to convey the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornate and distant, relying on abstractions ("whisper of possibility," "silent composition") to generate gravitas. The melodramatic tone creates a barrier to intimacy with the character's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, fitting the "battered cathedral" tone without breaking character. The close third-person perspective effectively maintains the filter of Lyra’s specific sensory distortions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice relies heavily on filtering ("She believed," "She realized," "She knew") and poetic abstraction, distancing the reader from the immediate moment. The reliance on stock phrases creates a monotonous texture that lacks distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately "contemplative," matching Marek’s trade and temperament. The shift from the technical language of the dam to the poetic register of the glassblower feels organic and earned. The pacing controls the release of information well, mirroring the slow thaw described in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("synthetic heart beating in sync with the universe") which creates distance. Emotional states are frequently reported via filters ("she felt," "she realized") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.8)
    Voice is severely compromised by mechanical phrase looping that destroys narrative texture. The lack of rhythmic variety and the robotic insertion of full noun phrases ("flaking gold leaf booklet") create a monotonous, artificial cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical jargon ("sensors," "cascade failure") with lyrical observation to suit the sentient robot persona. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw," "He realized") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the loops. The narrative distance remains stable, but the prose occasionally drifts into explaining the character's internal state rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is cloyingly poetic and overly earnest, frequently resorting to sentimental abstraction ("tears mixing with the rain," "silent war"). This filter distances the reader from the reality of the scene, substituting distinct character voice with flowery adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice attempts a mythic tone but stiffens into artificiality, particularly in dialogue where characters speak in thematic thesis statements. The integration of required phrases disrupts the narrative rhythm, causing the prose to stumble at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone, though it frequently drifts into melodrama ("equations of her existence"). The unmediated repetition of the technical phrase "procedural generation" within this high-fantasy voice creates a jarring register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental, relying on "purple" phrasing ("filament of hush," "vow," "shimmering") that creates distance. The tone reads more like a parable than a grounded literary narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining emotions instead of dramatizing them. The dialogue feels artificial and expository ("guardian angel," "small treasure that meant the world").

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("hinges crying out," "starlight pooled like liquid mercury"). There is a reliance on adverbs and adjective-noun pairings ("stubborn anachronism," "deliberate glyphs," "absolutely certain") that creates a dense, overwrought texture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative suffers from &quot;helpful narrator syndrome,&quot; over-explaining emotional states (&quot;palpable peace&quot;) and motivations instead of trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is strong, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the atmospheric intent of the piece perfectly. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature, though it occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("topology of erasures") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a "gloomy cheerful" poetic register that suits the fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from extreme psychic distance, filtering all events through a summarizing lens. The tone relies on adjectival stacking ("perpetual," "vibrant," "defiant") which creates a monochromatic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from severe POV leakage, describing "iridescent feathers" and "spectral lines" that the focalizer cannot perceive. This visual reliance in a blind POV shatters the immersive filter, substituting authorial observation for character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "purple" straining, relying on overwrought metaphors (the bird as a comma, the outpost as a comma) that draw attention to the writing rather than the story. The tone is serious but monolithic, lacking the modulation required to make the climax feel distinct from the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone but often drifts into distancing abstractions ("silence became a begging question"). The narrative distance keeps the reader observing the ritual from afar rather than inhabiting the physical strain of the tuning process.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a generic "literary" filter that keeps the reader at a distance. The narration tends to explain the emotional significance of events ("Lina saw in its ruin a mirror of her own interrupted path") instead of allowing the dramatization to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stylized to the point of artificiality, creating a distance that dampens immediacy. Dialogue feels unnatural, serving primarily as a vehicle for thematic assertions rather than character interaction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "writerly" intrusion, prioritizing lyrical density over character-specific idiom. Phrases like "planets performed their slow dance" and "poetry of someone" feel like authorial flourishes rather than the thoughts of a hardened firefighter. The narrative distance prevents intimacy with the character's raw grief.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice aims for a lyrical, fable-like tone but is compromised by the mechanical insertion of required phrases ("transiently rooted," "interrupted cadence").

    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a slightly elevated, lyrical tone. It handles the transition from the domestic workshop to the fantastical underground smoothly, though the insertion of specific prompt phrases occasionally disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is authoritative and distinct, fitting the "balanced alchemist" persona with a consistent lyrical register. However, the reliance on repetitive phrasing ("weight," "factually mystical") occasionally disrupts the otherwise polished narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mythic, lyrical voice is consistent and appropriate for the subject matter. The narrative distance remains close to Kael’s perception, enhancing the emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but over-relies on filter verbs ("She knew," "She saw," "She realized") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone often slips into purple abstraction ("geometry of grace," "violet fire") that explains the metaphor rather than letting it resonate implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is consistently overwrought and "purple" ("shimmered between solid and sigh"), creating distance rather than intimacy. The narrative relies on filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized") and high-flown abstraction rather than concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and authoritative, blending technical observation with melancholic reflection in a way that feels specific to Marlon. The perceptual signature is strong—seeing the world through worn cables and dust patterns—though the shift to high-concept phrasing near the end ("architectural longing") slightly distances the POV from its grounded roots.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice sustains a cohesive, mythic tone that suits the magical realism genre. However, the lexicon feels slightly limited at points, particularly the threefold repetition of "negotiable" to describe reality, which flattens the texture of the prose slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened, poetic register appropriate for the setting. However, the narration is distant and interpretive, often summarizing the meaning of an event before the event fully lands (e.g., explaining the mirror ritual's symbolism immediately). This filtering distances the reader from the immediate pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "tinkersong wonder" tone that fits the genre well. The perspective stays close to the repairman's sensory experience, though the transition to the woman's reveal is handled with a slightly sudden shift in focus.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric, fitting the "archivist of questions" persona. It occasionally drifts into detachment, filtering immediate experience through abstract nouns ("explanation's architecture collapsed") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly precious, relying on "art-speak" and romantic abstractions that create distance from the immediate physical reality. The tone remains reverent and breathless throughout, lacking the modulation needed to heighten tension during the storm or the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a lack of lexical control, relying on sentimental phrasing ("silent lover," "umbral tenderness") that creates a melodramatic tone. The psychic distance is static, offering a filtered view of the protagonist's "quiet" state without diving into the visceral reality of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and robotic, heavily relying on the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases which disrupts the flow. The "searing reverie" and "retro-cognitive" descriptors feel pasted in rather than integrated into a consistent character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative distance is too great, utilizing a fable-like filter ("He realized," "He believed") that keeps the reader at arm's length. The voice summarizes the character's experience instead of inhabiting the moment-to-moment sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, successfully maintaining a reverent, mythic tone that suits the magical realism of the premise without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice aims for a mythic register but is undermined by repetitive phrasing and filter verbs ("Elara felt," "She knew"). The narration tells the reader how to interpret the scene ("furious tranquility," "wild serenity") rather than trusting the imagery to convey the tone. The prose texture is consistent but overly dependent on abstract descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the "solstice hush." However, occasional "writerly" flourishes ("winds that had forgotten how to whisper") create a slight distance from the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is a distant, expository summary that explains Sola's internal state rather than inhabiting it. The psychic distance is extreme, summarizing years of emotional growth in single sentences ("Sola's heart swelled with a quiet strength"). There is no distinct perceptual signature or voice-driven rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=1.8)
    The voice is mechanical and distant, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The narration relies on repeating prompt phrases to bridge gaps, resulting in a robotic texture that prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into abstractions that distance the reader from the immediate scene. The "figure" speaking in pure metaphor feels artificial rather than like a distinct character.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is monotonous and overly sentimental; distinctness is lost to a droning rhythm that lacks variation, and the repetitive phrasing feels algorithmic rather than intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by accidental echoes and repetitive tagging. The repetition of phrases like "brazen calm" and "gently systematic" distracts from the fable-like tone, making the narration feel unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical repetition of the epithet &quot;luminous skeptic&quot; (used three times), which disrupts the flow and reads as a constraint artifact. While the POV distance is stable, the tone is monotone and overly reliant on adjective-noun pairings that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but relies heavily on repetitive sentence constructions ("tongue of the sunken city," "tongue of the stone masons"). The distance keeps the reader from engaging with the stakes of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and poetic, effectively maintaining the melancholic tone. However, the high register of abstract thought attributed to Wick ("tinted revelations," "exhausted hope") occasionally clashes with his animal identity, creating a distance in the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly reliant on breathless, "writerly" metaphors ("breath felt like a shout," "drop of ink") that draw attention to the author rather than the character. The elevated tone clashes with the lack of logical grounding in the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("sacredly playful," "pocket sundial lid"). While the tone aims for lyrical, the heavy reliance on these specific tags disrupts the rhythm and makes the narration feel assembled rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "purple prose" tendencies, leaning on adjective-heavy abstractions ("pale, expectant light," "luminous absence"). While the tone is cohesive, the reliance on high-flown rhetoric distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a fable-like quality. However, the prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("She knew," "She realized," "She hesitated") which distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience. The "thrumming" motivation is a stock emotional cue.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic, "purple" phrasing ("sky grumbled," "woven hush draped"). While the tone matches the fairy-tale logic, the prose often filters the experience through interpretative labels ("eyes reflecting the same hope") rather than allowing the reader to infer state from action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.4)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent but slips into omniscient summary in the final paragraphs to expedite the resolution. The shift from Kael’s immediate experience to a broad community overview creates a distancing effect at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone. It handles the shift from physical action to metaphysical repair smoothly. The focus remains tightly on Elara’s perception, maintaining a stable third-person limited POV throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and melodramatic, relying on clichés ("time slowed," "heart beating in sync") and forced phrasing ("temporary eternity"). The POV filters the experience through distancing verbs ("Elias saw," "Elias felt") and abstract summaries, preventing immediate immersion in the character's sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, matching the magical realism of the premise. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Elara’s sensory experience and interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic over-explanation ("silent scream," "raw solace"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on a generalized poetic register that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice suffers from high narrative distance, reading more like a fable synopsis than an inhabited perspective. The tone is consistent but melodramatic, keeping the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the magical realism genre. However, the forced repetition of specific phrases ("softly persistent") damages the illusion of a controlled, organic voice. The perspective stays close to Cornelius but feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the melancholic, magical realist tone of the piece. However, the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "empirically intuitive" feels artificial and disrupts the otherwise smooth texture of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent and distinct, suiting the fable-like quality of the narrative. However, the frequent repetition of key descriptors ("bleeding starlight," "softly commanding") suggests a lack of distance control or lexical range, causing the narrative authority to waver.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently high-flown but suffers from artificiality, particularly in dialogue ("By letting the past fold into the present like ink into water..."). The characters speak in written prose and thematic theses rather than natural speech. The tone is homogeneous, lacking the modulation between tension and release necessary for a convincing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "lucid dream chronicler" persona well. However, it maintains a high level of narrative distance and relies on filtered observation, which keeps the reader at arm's length from the visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the narrative voice is consistent, the dialogue feels staged and overly poetic; the clockmaker speaks in perfect aphorisms ("fear into first breath") that lack naturalism. The POV occasionally slips into explaining the character's subconscious thoughts to ensure the reader catches the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, relying on high-register melodrama ("infinite yet fragile," "vessel of stories") that flattens the emotional impact. The prose struggles with distance, telling the reader what to feel ("felt the weight of her past lifting") rather than evoking the sensation through specific, grounded details. The lack of distinct vocal texture makes the narration feel generic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dialogue is the story's weakest element, reading as highly artificial and composed rather than spoken. Characters trade poetic metaphors ("hush is like the fermata") that sound like written prose, breaking the illusion of a genuine, high-stakes conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone appropriate for the cosmic subject matter. The POV is stable, filtering the surreal environment through the witness's perspective. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory, prioritizing high-sounding phrases over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent distance but is marred by excessive filtering ("Elias realized," "Elias understood") that dulls immediacy. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on a monotone, elevated register that creates a barrier between the reader and the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone appropriate for the setting. However, the reliance on repeated epithets ("spatially gifted," "familiar stranger") flattens the distinctness of the perception over time.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is distant, relying on filter verbs ("She decided," "She realized") and melodramatic abstraction ("margins of desperation") that insulates the reader from the scene. The tone is consistent but leans into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice leans into a fable-like melodrama that distances the reader ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement"). The reliance on purple phrasing and explanatory telling flattens the distinctness of Mira's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice oscillates awkwardly between flowery melodrama ("salt-kissed") and jarring legal/technical jargon ("proximate cause," "context"). The tone is inconsistent and artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is a distant, explanatory omniscient that summarizes dialogue and emotion instead of allowing them to unfold in real-time. This distance prevents any accumulation of narrative pressure or reader immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully filters the world through the protagonist's sensory limitations. However, the tone occasionally drifts into abstract sentimentality that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the protagonist's internal state instead of showing it. The heavy reliance on metaphor creates a distance that muffles the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the lyrical register well. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("fluid geometry," "continent of meaning") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("ghost of a million voices," "analytical heart sing"). The POV filter relies on adjectives to convey depth rather than observation or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical sci-fi vocabulary with lyrical emotionality ("synapses," "resonance" vs. "ghosted," "aching"). The close third-person POV is tightly controlled, filtering the surreal environment strictly through Kael’s specific knowledge and intent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic for the fable-like tone. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally relies on filtering ("Marek knew," "He identified") rather than direct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, mythic tone but slips into purple prose ("spiralingly calm," "weave light"). The narrative distance is too remote to engage emotionally, and the tone feels artificial due to the forced insertion of specific phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.9)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but creates excessive psychic distance, filtering the story through a knowing narrator who summarizes emotional states ("hearing the unspoken worries"). This "telling" approach prevents visceral engagement with the characters' immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and polished but leans heavily into "purple" descriptors ("water kisses land," "horizon without chains") that create distance. The tone feels overly mythic and generalized, lacking the distinct, specific texture of a unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizes the performer's "epic monologues" instead of letting the reader hear the specific language used. This robs the story of a unique textural layer; we are told the narration is dramatic, but the prose itself remains standard and explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy reliance on filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized," "She understood") creates unnecessary psychic distance and deadens immediacy. Interiority is expository, summarizing epiphanies with abstract nouns instead of embodying them in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its mythic, fable-like quality, but this creates excessive psychic distance that precludes emotional intimacy. The tone feels imposed on the characters, rendering the emotional beats performative rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suited to the subject matter. However, the mandatory inclusion of the phrase "powerfully gentle" feels slightly awkward and jarring within the otherwise smooth flow, and some internal monologue leans into expository telling.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but suffers from a distancing effect due to the fable-like register. The high-minded tone creates a barrier to emotional intimacy, keeping the reader at arm's length from the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a noir-tinged speculative piece. However, the narrative distance sometimes feels too close to the author’s thematic agenda, with the character speaking in polished aphorisms ("uniform of a religion that had failed its priests") that sound more like written prose than natural dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is consistent but heavily filtered, distancing the reader from the immediate experience ("She realized," "She felt," "She saw"). The voice adopts a generic "high fantasy" register that feels impersonal and lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into a "purple" register that distances the reader. The repetition of prompt-specific phrases like "softly deliberate" and "luminous" breaks the immersive spell, making the voice feel constructed around keywords.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The POV is consistent and close, filtering the world effectively through Elara’s guilt and expertise. There is occasional filtering ("Elara realized," "She understood") that creates unnecessary distance in an otherwise intimate narrative. The voice holds a steady, contemplative rhythm that matches the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.5)
    The third-person POV is stable but heavily reliant on filter verbs ("Elara realized," "She understood," "She felt") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The narrative voice often drifts into poetic abstraction ("whispers of leaves," "echo of a star's descent") that obscures rather than reveals the character's specific reality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and controlled, maintaining a consistent lyrical distance appropriate for the fable-like tone. However, the mechanical repetition of required phrases ("spatially imaginative," "hushed thunder") creates a stilted rhythm that occasionally disrupts the immersion. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mira, effectively filtering the world through her specific sensory apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is overly ornate and saturated with "purple prose," relying on clichés like "silken shadows" and "whispered secrets." This forced poetic register creates distance rather than intimacy, resulting in a melodramatic tone that feels performed rather than authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and mythic, suiting the fable mode well. However, the narrative distance sometimes feels too eager to interpret the imagery for the reader, reducing the immersive quality of the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("She realized," "She learned," "She understood") that buffer the reader from immediate experience. The fable-like detachment reduces emotional intimacy and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative creates unnecessary psychic distance through frequent filter verbs ("Lin feeling," "Lin understood," "felt the truth"). The voice is consistently sentimental and breathless, lacking the variation in texture needed to ground the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and atmospheric, integrating the "silent" communication style of the fortress into the narrative rhythm. The transition from the internal monologue of penance to the external action is handled with control. The tone matches the "frostbitten" atmosphere perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy register but suffers from distancing abstraction. Phrases like "breath in the slow lung of eternity" and "symphony of ink" prioritize poetic sound over narrative immediacy, creating a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("Lina [verb]...", "She [verb]...") that create a monotonous rhythm. The overuse of the specific phrase "periodically eternal" disrupts the narrative flow, making the voice feel mechanical and prompt-bound rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "stargazer" persona. However, the narrative distance occasionally widens to deliver summaries of the rebellion's state, slightly diluting the immediacy of Kai's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent mythic-literary tone. The shift from the physical action to the reflective conclusion is handled smoothly in terms of voice, even if the content becomes expository.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is stable, but the voice frequently slips into diagnostic jargon ("somatic marker," "archive," "trauma") that acts as a filter over the raw emotion. This creates a clinical distance that undercuts the intended intimacy of the grief and limits the distinctiveness of the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending lyrical description with the protagonist’s internal state. There is a distinct perceptual signature in how Elara views the world through the lens of art and light. However, occasionally the voice veers into "purple" territory with slightly overwrought metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into overwrought, adjective-heavy description ("pale skin seemed to drink the returning light"). While the tone is stable, the reliance on high-flown abstraction distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic phrasing ("frozen lullabies," "empire of ice"). The frequent repetition of specific, lengthy phrases suggests a checklist constraint that disrupts the natural flow of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on telling, using clunky prompt phrases ("senselessly perceptive," "inculcating") as exposition rather than weaving them into the POV's natural thought process. This creates a distance that flattens the emotional resonance of the ritual moments.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the mythic tone is consistent, the voice is severely compromised by lexical redundancy. The repetition of specific terms ("transliterated," "cool-headed") breaks the narrative spell and draws attention to the writing as a construct rather than an immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately contemplative for the setting and character. The transition between the external atmosphere (fog, observatory) and internal logic is smooth. The voice maintains control, though it occasionally leans into dense metaphor clusters that border on heavy-handedness.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, perfectly matching the "cosmic dust" and "celestial" subject matter without slipping into melodrama. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining close focus on Elara’s perception and the surreal mechanics of the lab.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its poetic, slightly elevated tone, but it struggles to integrate the required phrases naturally. The phrasing "fingers, socially perceptive as any diplomat's" creates a jarring semantic clash that breaks the narrative spell. While the POV remains stable, the voice often prioritizes ornamental adjectives over clarity, creating a distance between the reader and the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice suffers from "emotional ventriloquism," asserting feelings ("weight of empathy") without earning them. The tone clashes, mixing mythic purple prose ("weep," "ghost") with jarring clinical jargon ("retrocognitively trapped").

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose struggles to integrate mandatory phrasing naturalistically, resulting in clunky constructions like "synesthetically blessed perception." The voice wavers between atmospheric observation and explanatory exposition ("He knew that the timeline had splintered"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is monotonous and severely marred by the robotic repetition of prompt keywords, which flattens the prose texture. While the POV is consistent, it operates at a remove, reporting on the process rather than immersing the reader in the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent but suffers from excessive psychic distance, filtering experience through a lens of poetic interpretation rather than immediate sensation. The narrative tone is overly reverent and homogenized, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish Lira’s specific worldview from a generic omniscient narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic register that suits the fable-like mode. While efficient, the high psychic distance prevents deep emotional engagement with the protagonist's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a serious, slightly elevated tone. However, the dialogue occasionally feels stiff ("Your passage is vouchsafed"), and the narration leans on filter verbs ("Kael knew," "Kael felt") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy-handed, elevated register that relies on "thesaurus-itis" ("spindrift serenity," "geometry," "architecture of the girl"). The POV slips briefly into omniscient summary regarding the woman's history ("She had married and widowed"), which dilutes the "closely attentive" focus of Silas's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental ("sweet clumsiness of youth"), creating a distance where the narrator diagnoses emotions instead of evoking them. The tone borders on instructional, lacking the grit or distinctness required to elevate the "cozy apocalypse" aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical but monotonous, maintaining a high-poetic register that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting. The repetition of the "rhythm of oars" phrase feels like a forced artifact rather than an organic voice modulation, creating a mechanical cadence that clashes with the gardening/locksmithing context.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.1)
    The point of view is distant and observational, summarizing the character's journey rather than immersing the reader in the moment. The voice relies on a "She [verb]s" sentence structure that creates a repetitive, detached rhythm. The tone is consistently elevated but lacks the texture of specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly precious, relying heavily on filter verbs ("she imagined," "she knew") that distance the reader from immediate experience. The tone is uniform and saccharine, lacking the modulation required to distinguish moments of discovery from moments of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately tense, though it occasionally slips into &quot;telling&quot; internal realizations to speed the plot (&quot;Mara saw the real chess match was cosmic&quot;). The perspective remains tightly anchored to Mara, maintaining a stable filter on events.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice leans heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("prismatic desire," "sonic tempest") that creates distance; prompt-specific phrases feel inserted mechanically rather than arising from the character's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, effectively filtering the world through Elara's analytical yet artistic perspective. The distance is well-managed, though it occasionally slips into explanatory mode regarding her condition and feelings.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers significantly from the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The repetition of "nervously confident" and "spongey dread" creates a "checklist" effect that disrupts the otherwise competent third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but mechanically poetic, relying on the recycling of prompt phrases to sustain tone. The overuse of complex descriptors ("fractured," "mosaic," "sculpt") creates a purple texture that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is overly affected, prioritizing dense, ornamental phrasing over narrative clarity. Dialogue feels artificial and stagey, with characters speaking in perfectly articulated metaphors that sound like written prose rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the subject matter. However, the narrative distance occasionally slips into an essayistic or explanatory register ("When understanding dawns, it comes not with sunrise..."), which creates a barrier between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.6)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent but leans into melodrama with phrases like "ghost" and "greedy hand." The narrative distance remains too remote to grant access to the druid's specific experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice aims for a mythic, poetic register but frequently lapses into overwrought melodrama ("future press against her ribs like a second heartbeat"). The tone is consistent but creates a distance that prevents intimacy with the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("fiercely gentle," "inlaying meaning," "trammel") multiple times within a short word count. This creates a stilted, artificial rhythm that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," summarizing the protagonist's emotional state with certainty rather than allowing ambiguity. While the POV is stable, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard melancholic phrasing that keeps the reader at a distance from the raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable tone for the ethereal setting. However, the voice relies heavily on repeated taglines ("kindly methodical," "haunted ambition") to define the character, which flattens the perspective. The transition from technical problem-solving to lyrical epiphany is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and fittingly rhythmic for the "cathedral" atmosphere. The narrative distance is well-controlled, though the filter verbs in the conclusion ("She understood," "she thought") create a slight barrier during the moment of highest insight.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical inspection terms with lyrical descriptions of decay. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("spectral promises," "tomb of anxiety") that distances the reader from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is consistently melodramatic and prone to filter verbs ("She felt," "She knew," "She realized") that distance the reader. The tone attempts a poetic register but achieves only a heavy-handed density that obscures the character's immediate experience under layers of interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent and relies heavily on "similes of abstraction" ("sighing like old memories") that distance the reader. The repetition of the specific phrase "cautious exuberance" three times betrays a lack of control over the narrative filter and emotional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and matches the magical realism elements, maintaining a unified tone throughout. However, the narration occasionally drifts into melodrama and over-reliance on "whispering" and "murmuring" rather than sharper, more active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the solemnity of the ritual. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to Elara’s perception, though the tone occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("stuttering Morse code the universe forgot it was sending").

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic. It maintains a stable POV, though the filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew," "she felt") occasionally dilute the immediacy of the perception.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently diagnosing the character's internal state ("That emptiness mirrored my own conflict"). The narration acts as a guide interpreting the story for the reader rather than an immersive perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for a fable, but its distance prevents emotional intimacy. The register occasionally drifts into grandiloquence ("heartbeat of the cosmos") that feels performed rather than authentic to the character’s experience. The POV remains stable, but the filter is so thick with interpretation that immediate sensation is muffled.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, though it relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("temporal fabric," "symphony of meaning") that sometimes obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, melancholic, and controlled, fitting the story's mood well. The shift to a more lyrical, transcendent tone at the end is earned by the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffocated by "purple" ornamentation and forced poeticisms. The narrative distance is too close to the abstract concepts and too far from the physical reality of the scene. The relentless metaphorical density eventually numbs the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the high-concept sci-fi setting. However, the reliance on adverbs and abstract nouns ("reverence," "unity," "might-have-beens") creates a distance that muffles the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic distance appropriate for the genre. However, the repetition of "The heartbroken reaper" as a tag feels stylized to the point of affectation, reducing intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and stabilized in the third person, but it suffers from overwrought phrasing ("serenaded by the silent sea"). The tone remains somewhat monotonous, lacking modulation between the mechanical moments of fixing the bell and the mystical climax. There is a tendency to use abstract summaries ("plausible impossibility made manifest") instead of concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.5)
    The point of view is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly interpreting the emotional weight of scenes for the reader instead of dramatizing them. The voice leans into melodramatic phrasing ("perfume of resurrection") that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience. There is little distinction between the narrator's voice and the character's perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified, fitting the lyrical fantasy mode. However, the distance is high, often prioritizing poetic cadence over immediate interior access, which keeps the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is monotonous, largely due to the forced insertion of required phrases which disrupts natural cadence. The repetition of "soundless echo" and "watcher's burden" creates a robotic, checklist-like texture that distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, authoritative, and meditative, fitting the "sensei" archetype well. The shift in tone from detached observation to emotional vulnerability is handled smoothly, maintaining narrative control throughout the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative voice is monotonous and heavily filtered, relying on a small set of recycled phrases that deaden the rhythm. The lack of distinct perceptual signature results in a "committee voice" quality, where the narration feels like a generic summary rather than a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, blending whimsy with melancholy effectively. There is a slight drift in POV distance—moving from Eleanor's deep interiority to observing Sarah's private moments ("Sarah would never know") and finally to an omniscient summary of the future. While the tone is cohesive, the perspective shifts loosen the narrative container.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory ("The guardian's job was to wait..."), creating a psychic distance that buffers the reader from the "feral" experience. The tone is often too sophisticated for the purported nature of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and suited to the high-fantasy alchemical content. Interiority is well-managed, blending technical observation with emotional weight. The shift in tone from stifling heat/ash to cold/glass is handled with excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct and controlled, blending technical jargon with mythic weight ("celestial signal interpreter," "geometry of patience") to create a cohesive tone. The narrative distance is managed well, zooming in to intimate tactile details during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by an earnest, repetitive cadence that mirrors the prompt list. The POV filter is stable, but the prose frequently lapses into "purple" description that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, dream-like precision that suits the "rational enchantment" concept without becoming vague. The distance is managed well, keeping the reader close to Mira’s perception while maintaining the gallery’s distinct atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the somber setting. However, the integration of required phrases results in awkward, non-idiomatic constructions ("balancedly curious nature") that momentarily break the narrative trance and flatten the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistently melodramatic, prioritizing "poetic" sounding phrases over narrative clarity. The narration distances the reader with overt explanations of feelings ("curiosity flares") instead of immersing them in the sensory experience of the contact tracer.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical terminology with melancholic introspection in a way that suits the setting. The shift to a broader perspective in the final paragraph is handled well, avoiding a jarring break in tone.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains a high level of psychic distance, filtering immediate experience through interpretive summaries of the character's mental state. The reliance on filter verbs and abstract internal monologue creates a barrier to intimacy, keeping the reader observing the character's realization rather than feeling it.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the subject matter. The distance is controlled, though at times it risks becoming too detached, prioritizing lyrical abstraction over immediate sensory immersion in the protagonist's physical decline.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice adopts a melodramatic, high-fantasy tone ("whispered of ancient hunts," "danced with gravity") that creates distance and feels overwritten.

The tone is consistent but stiff and artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mythic, lyrical voice suits the fable-like content well. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She understood," "She felt") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on clichés like "ghost in the machine" and "fragile thread" that dull the impact. The POV maintains a melancholic distance that filters the immediate experience, preventing deeper immersion in the high-stakes environment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.4)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and stylized, fitting the magical realism genre, but maintains a cold distance from the protagonist. The "sanely eccentric" descriptor suggests a quirkiness that the somber, reverent tone does not actually deliver.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical, fable-like quality, maintaining a steady tone throughout. However, the relentless use of metaphorical modifiers ("improbable beginnings," "luminous absence") creates a monotone of profundity that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally overwrought ("seams of ordinary speech"). The tone matches the magical realism genre but risks melodrama in its descriptions of secrets and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a detached, fable-like distance that keeps the emotional stakes at arm's length. The repeated use of phrases like "chronically curious" and "crisp nostalgia" feels mechanical, reading more like a prompt response checklist than a natural narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the meaning of actions ("a lesson in motion and stillness") instead of letting them stand. The tone is consistent but overly guided, lacking the distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.5)
    The mythic, distanced voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre but prevents emotional intimacy; the tone remains static and elevated throughout, failing to modulate with the supposed physical toll of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)

    The voice is monotonous and distant, heavily reliant on filter verbs ("Elena felt," "Elena saw") that distance the reader from the experience. The tone is uniform throughout, lacking modulation for the discovery or the climax. The narrative distance prevents any genuine intimacy with the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly attuned to the requested "sophisticated melancholy" tone. While it occasionally risks pretension, the stylistic consistency creates a cohesive, dreamlike texture that suits the magical realism of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice adopts a distant, mythic register that feels more like a fable summary than an inhabited POV. While consistent in its elevated tone, the voice creates a barrier to intimacy, filtering all experience through a layer of poetic abstraction. The shift in focalization from the balladeer to the scribe is abrupt and lacks a distinct perceptual signature for the new character.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("conspired to scatter sunlight," "curled like spirits"). The point of view is stable, but the reliance on explanatory phrasing ("the method became clear") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice suffers from repetitive phrasing ("sociable isolation," "phrasebook dog-ear") that flattens the prose texture. The tone strains for poetic effect with adjectives rather than precise observation, creating a distance from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is stifled by the robotic repetition of complex phrases ("soft hush," "hauntingly bright," "rhythm of repair") which disrupts the reading rhythm. The tone attempts a lyric quality but succumbs to a monotone delivery due to this lexical recycling.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.9)
    The fable-like voice creates excessive distance, filtering all events through summary and lacking immediate sensory grounding. The repetition of the phrase "strangely trustworthy" feels mechanical and forced rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrically consistent, fitting the surreal content. However, the excessive repetition of specific phrases ("vouchsafe," "beautifully flawed," "pane of hush") creates a mechanical rhythm that distracts from the emotional intent.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance that suits the "cursed caretaker" archetype well. The perspective stays firmly with Elara, effectively filtering the travelers' plight through her knowledgeable but detached lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, relying on "purple" phrasing ("braided the air," "pulse with the promise") that distances the reader. The tone lacks the restraint and subtext required for high-end literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is controlled but suffers from uniformity; the dialogue ("voice cracked as old leather") mirrors the narrator's high-poetic register, erasing distinction between characters. The relentless lyrical tone creates a distance that muffles the emotional grit of the "incision."

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the melancholic fantasy tone. However, it occasionally leans into melodramatic abstraction ("unspoken dream about to close") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("chaotically precise," "quaking reverie," "synaptic plasticity") which appear 4–5 times each in a short space. This creates a robotic, checklist-like cadence that flattens the intended lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the awkward repetition of specific descriptors ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze"). While the narrative stance is stable, the reliance on these repetitive phrases creates a mechanical feel that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.6)
    The point of view drifts from the sculptor to various animals (hedgehog, fox, rabbit) without establishing a consistent omniscient authority, reading instead as head-hopping. The narrative voice relies on repetitive tagging ("symphonically minded") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("ancient song," "metaphysical vertigo") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, leaning into "theatrical sincerity" to the point of melodrama ("thin as starlight"). While the tone is cohesive, the reliance on poetic abstraction creates a distance that prevents genuine engagement with the character's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic tone but frequently slips into purple prose ("gravel that sang like broken glass," "glittered like forgotten stars"). The register is consistent, but the affectation creates distance rather than intimacy, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is robotic, characterized by the obsessive repetition of full noun phrases ("jittery relic courier," "dragonfly-wing pendant") instead of using pronouns or variations.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the mystic protagonist. The POV remains tightly anchored to Seraphine's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but heavily reliant on filter verbs ("he sensed," "he felt," "he remembered") which distances the reader. The tone leans into sentimentality without earning the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice suffers from a "mythic announcer" tone that creates distance rather than intimacy, exacerbated by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but over-reliant on filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood," "she felt") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like elevation that suits the "futuristic nostalgia" tone. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, filtering high-concept sci-fi elements (orbitals, terraforming) through a grounding, sensory-focused subjectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, heavily relying on filter verbs ("Elena knew," "She realized") that create distance. The tone drifts into melodrama ("tomb of forgotten sound") rather than grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is generally consistent but suffers a significant head-hop at the climax ("suddenly she saw through time to when whales sang"). This shifts from the tuner's external observation to the child's internal experience, breaking the established narrative distance at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the subject. It successfully blends technical language ("soil pH at 6.5") with poetic observation, though the balance occasionally tips toward melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "mysterious familiarity" tone well. However, the prose occasionally drifts into stylization that feels performative (e.g., "Borrowing sugar becomes tea becomes truth"). The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but occasionally overwrought ("tragically radiant echo," "ghostly resolve"). The reliance on abstract nouns as agents ("memory could be a quarantine") creates a distance that muffles the emotional immediacy of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice adopts a "legend" tone that creates excessive distance, relying on clichés ("shadow among shadows," "scent of ink and roses") instead of distinct perception. The prose often filters the experience through abstract summaries ("hands stained with... memory") rather than grounding the reader in the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("reed-blown melancholy," "serpentine nexus") that read like unedited insertions. This robotic recurrence breaks immersion and prevents the development of a distinct, organic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is flattened by the obsessive repetition of prompt phrases, creating a mechanical, template-like cadence. The relentless use of "borrowed starlight" and "windows of connection" drains the narrative of organic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distinct from the characters' lived reality, creating a distance that prevents immersion. The narrative relies on "telling" the reader what to feel ("scintillatingly somber beauty") rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," summarizing complex realizations to speed the plot. The distance is often too great to feel the immediate danger of the radiation or the social ostracization.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, fitting the "visionary" archetype well. The narrative distance is controlled. At times, the register becomes slightly elevated ("stitching quantum hiss into poetry") in a way that feels more authorial than character-bound, but it suits the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and fable-like, maintaining a stable distance appropriate for the genre. However, the stylized tone occasionally creates an emotional buffer, prioritizing poetic cadence over immediate interior access. The distinct perceptual signature is present but sometimes feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "fleshly ethereal" prompt well. However, it leans toward the baroque ("crystalline fist," "sorrow's geometry"), which sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately mythic, though it occasionally creates distance through elevated abstraction. The narrative stance is confident, but the reliance on explaining the philosophy reduces the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama, frequently telling the reader what Mara "knew" or "felt" instead of showing it. The prose texture is inconsistent, shifting between procedural description and purple metaphors ("echoing the pulse of an unseen heartbeat").

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, reverent tone appropriate for the subject. It occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought phrasing ("matters of forgiveness that his collar couldn't quite unravel") but avoids head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("suspected," "watched") and repeated prompt phrases. The fable-like tone suits the material but keeps the reader at arm's length from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic ("mournful hum," "chorus of absence," "talisman against silence"). High narrative distance keeps the reader detached from the protagonist's immediate experience. The tone feels manufactured, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the awkward forced integration of prompt phrases (e.g., "weighted breath before reply" used as a noun phrase). The tone aims for mythic significance but veers into abstraction, and the shift in focus from Kael to the boy dilutes the POV's emotional authority at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is hampered by the unmotivated tense shift in the opening and a reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She thought," "She felt"). The tone is consistently poetic but often drifts into high-distance abstraction, keeping the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, oscillating between flowery, melodramatic description and dry, academic terminology ("intersubjective"). The narrative distance is uncomfortably close to the authorial hand, lacking a distinct character filter. The tone feels manufactured, prioritizing "writerly" sounding phrases over authentic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice attempts a mythic register but is undercut by mechanical repetition of prompt phrases. The lack of distinct textural variation creates a drone-like quality that flattens narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like distance but relies on repetitive phrasing and mechanical tag usage ("perceptively calm" appears three times). The distance prevents intimacy, keeping the reader observing the concept rather than inhabiting the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scholarly, melancholic voice is distinct and consistent, suiting the protagonist well. There is a slight tendency toward purple prose ("dawn's gray breath"), but the narrative distance is generally well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a melancholic, mythic tone. It occasionally leans into heavy poeticisms ("tide was his own longing," "spools silent as memory") that border on affectation, but the control of distance is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly reverent and stiff, relying on high-register adjectives to assert significance that the scene work does not support. The narrative distance prevents intimacy, presenting Kael's actions through a filter of professional proficiency that excludes reader empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the emotional significance of every moment ("a paradox of life and decay"). The tone is consistently elevated and precious, creating a distance that prevents intimacy; the prose interprets the scene for the reader rather than letting the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person voice is functional but distant, relying on "telling" interiority ("Elara felt a quiet satisfaction") rather than embodied perception. The tone is consistent, but the lack of distinct idiom or rhythmic variance limits the character's presence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and intelligent. Moira's dialogue feels slightly stagey and aphoristic ("Failure is just the first draft of memory"), which detracts from the naturalism of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice adopts a distant, fable-like quality that prevents intimacy or distinct perceptual signature. While consistent, the tone relies heavily on poetic clichés ("whispered of tides," "rising like dawn") that flatten the narrative into a lullaby rather than a sharp, lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and essayistic ("cathedral of quiet decay," "ancient promise"), creating a psychic distance that prevents intimacy with the character's raw state.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but heavily marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("lucidly watchful," "inside the whisper") as structural refrains. This checklist-style usage disrupts the narrative rhythm and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but saturated with fable-like clichés ("heart full," "tear slide down their cheek"). Emotional responses are dictated to the reader through filter verbs ("Elara knew," "felt the hush") rather than evoked through action. The tone is overly sentimental, lacking the sharp edge or distinct texture required for high-end literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its mythic, lyrical register, but maintains a somewhat distant, filtered quality ("She felt," "She sensed"). The tone is cohesive, though it leans heavily on a few repeated descriptors that limit the texture of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fable-like, atmospheric voice is consistent and suits the magical realism genre. The narrative distance is appropriate for the reflective tone, though it occasionally drifts into slightly elevated or purple registers that distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the fable-like logic of the world. The rhythmic repetition of the ritual phrase "by orienting properly" functions well as a liturgical refrain, establishing a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but is undermined by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases. The narrative distance is stable, yet the prose feels more constructed than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and heavily reliant on "poetic" abstraction. The tone creates a barrier to empathy because the narrator speaks in prepared thematic statements rather than immediate, lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the narrative distance is stable, the voice relies on sequential scaffolding ("First, she... Next, she...") that creates a repetitive, list-like rhythm. The tone leans into poetic abstraction ("apneic stillness") that distances the reader from the granular reality of the labor.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyricism but suffers significantly from lexical redundancy. The identical repetition of complex phrases damages the authorial authority and creates a robotic cadence that distracts from the emotional content.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is cluttered with filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized," "She recalled") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. Prompt phrases like "thoughtfully clear" are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the narrative rhythm and breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Elara’s worldview. However, the tone risks becoming monotonous without sharper emotional modulation during the decoding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative distance is filtered through frequent "thought verbs" ("She imagined," "She felt," "She understood"), creating a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience. The voice is consistent but overly poetic, often prioritizing flowery description over clear, grounded observation. There is little distinction between the narrator's voice and the character's internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fairy-tale tone appropriate for the genre. However, the prose suffers from a lack of variation in sentence structure and a heavy reliance on "He [verb]" constructions in the middle section. The distance of the POV prevents deep emotional engagement with Lysander's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the meaning of actions and symbols to the reader. The tone is overly poetic and abstract, creating distance from the immediate physical action. There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature beyond the heavy-handed thematic filter.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly ornamental, relying on poetic abstraction ("embers of a star," "sidereal patience") rather than grounded, embodied perception. The tone assumes a "storybook" quality that distances the reader from the gritty reality of a decaying city.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone appropriate for a fable. However, it leans on filter verbs ("She understood," "She activated") and abstract summarization of internal states rather than grounding the Sentinel’s perspective in immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a somewhat generic "literary" register with elevated phrasing that feels constructed. The distance remains fairly static, observing Kael from the outside without diving deep into the messy, embodied reality of his grief or artistic frustration.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the mythic quality of the clock-keeper archetype. The shift from the cold precision of the ridge to the warmth of the tower is handled with smooth control, and the interiority feels distinct to Elara's observant nature.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice is monotonous and heavily marred by the mechanical repetition of multi-word phrases, preventing a distinct perceptual signature from emerging. The narrative distance is consistent but feels artificial, functioning as a delivery mechanism for required terms.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a dignified, fable-like tone that suits the setting. However, the psychic distance is quite far, keeping the reader observing Kaelen rather than inhabiting her experience. The reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns ("sensitive to the weight of unwritten consequence") creates a buffer that dulls emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.0)
    Narration is distanced by a high density of filter verbs ("She realized," "She imagined," "She believed"), which buffers the reader from the immediate experience. The voice feels uniform and overly writerly, prioritizing poetic musing over grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical, melancholic tone, but often leans into overwrought phrasing ("exhales a ghost," "somber marvel"). The narrative distance is somewhat remote, prioritizing poetic description over immediate, grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a precise, detached consistency that mirrors the protagonist's worldview. The shift to the patrolman's perspective ("confused by...") is a slight POV wobble, but the overall control of tone and distance is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is distant and overly reverent, smoothing over the grit of the classroom with abstract descriptions like "static of inherited distrust." While the tone is consistent, it operates at a fable-like remove that prevents immersion in the specific reality of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice suffers from a register clash, awkwardly mixing the sensory language of a chef with the academic specificity of "synaptic plasticity." Narrative distance is inconsistent, frequently pulling back to explain the magic system or label the character's state ("strengthened her resolve") instead of staying immersed in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the fable-like genre, creating a cohesive mood. However, the distance remains somewhat static, observing the protagonist rather than deeply inhabiting her stress during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is mechanical, marred by the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases that disrupts natural rhythm. The constant use of the full title "creeping normality noticer" (seven times) and the refrain "streetlights daydream" prevents immersion and creates a drone-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and mythic, fitting the "stone statue" persona well. It stumbles occasionally into adjective-heavy phrasing ("beautiful, dangerous gift," "crushing clarity") that feels slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, but the inclusion of the phrase "Timeframe: None—" as a sentence opening disrupts the established third-person register. It reads like a prompt label paste rather than integrated narration.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.9)
    The POV shifts from Kael to Mira's internal memory ("characters stirred a memory") and back to Kael without section breaks, violating the single-POV default and diffusing narrative tension. The narrative voice is consistently elevated but overly helpful, explaining the meaning of actions as they happen.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizing, creating a fable-like detachment that prevents emotional engagement. The point of view filters experience through generalities instead of grounding it in specific, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a heavy, mythic tone that distances the reader from immediate experience. The narration relies on naming emotions ("she felt the bleak exhilaration") rather than evoking them through specific, embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("beautiful and obscene") that feels slightly detached. The advisor's dialogue is functional as a plot device but lacks a distinct personality beyond "cryptic guide."

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyrical tone that suits the mythic quality of the story. While the psychic distance is somewhat remote, preventing deep intimacy, the rhythmic control and vocabulary choices ("predictive geometries," "silvered") successfully establish the prophet's unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice maintains a consistent, mythic register that suits the subject matter perfectly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing access to Kael’s specialized knowledge and internal state without slipping into exposition or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "telling" over "showing," relying on abstract summaries of thought processes ("pondered the parallels") rather than sensory immediacy. The perspective is stable, though it keeps the reader at an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the "stoic" character. However, it relies occasionally on "telling" internal states ("He moved stoically sensitive") rather than demonstrating them through distinct perception or reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative voice is stiff and suffers from "keyword stuffing," reducing immersion. The reliance on complex adjective strings ("tranquilly perceptive calm") creates a purple, artificial tone.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent in its fable-like, lyrical register but creates significant psychic distance. The reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") keeps the reader observing the character's wisdom rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a distinct, melancholy register appropriate for the subject. However, the narration is overly interpretive, frequently pausing to explain the significance of moments ("This was the unfiltered awakening...") rather than trusting the reader to infer meaning from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident, fitting the sci-fantasy genre well. Point of view remains stable with Elara, though the narration tends to over-explain the significance of moments rather than letting the imagery speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice attempts a literary register but veers into purple prose ("broken sentences," "sieved hush") that feels artificial. The repetition of prompt-specific phrases disrupts the narrative flow and draws attention to the construction rather than the character. The tone remains static and melodramatic throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn for the high-fantasy diplomatic context. However, it maintains a psychic distance that favors observation over immediate experience, keeping the reader somewhat detached from Kael's internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, maintaining a distinct perspective throughout. However, the prose occasionally over-filters the experience ("he realized," "Elias felt") and leans into poetic abstraction that distances the reader from the immediate physical action. The rhythm is generally good, but the "merrily melancholic" phrasing disrupts the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on melodramatic phrasing ("paradox the procedure could never fully resolve"). Narrative distance is distant and explanatory, frequently summarizing the character's internal state rather than inhabiting it. The tone struggles to balance the required "jaded wonder" with the sterile setting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental and melodramatic ("tears fell... each drop a tiny moon"). The tone lacks modulation, remaining at a breathless high pitch that exhausts the reader and distances them from the grit of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyrical, fable-like voice is consistent and confident, effectively maintaining the magical realist tone. However, the register occasionally tips into overwrought description ("liquid obsidian," "pregnant and full"), and the integration of prompt phrases feels slightly mechanical within the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending high-concept sci-fi with a mythic, elegiac tone that suits the subject matter. The perspective remains tightly controlled within Maya's unique sensorium. The voice successfully carries the weight of the backstory without drowning the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from a significant breach of the established POV; after anchoring in Kael's perspective, the story abruptly shifts to an omniscient summary of the pig/bird/fish sequence. This "helpful narrator" intrusion disrupts the psychic distance and explains plot mechanics that the protagonist cannot know, violating the intimacy of the short story form.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a focused third-person limited perspective. It successfully evokes a mood of quiet intrigue. There are moments of overwriting ("luminous promise," "revolution's midwife") where the prose draws too much attention to its own cleverness, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. The focus on light and pattern creates a cohesive perceptual signature for Elara, though the register occasionally drifts into overwrought poeticism that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily overwritten, prioritizing "poetic" sounding phrases over clarity and precision. The tone creates a melodramatic distance that prevents intimacy with the character, with the prose drawing attention to its own construction rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but detached, relying on a high-flown, abstract register ("unspent thunder") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality. The POV lacks a distinct perceptual signature, functioning more as a generic epic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental and distant, filtering events through a "poetic" lens that distances the reader from the grit of the prison. The narrative distance prevents intimacy with the protagonist’s shifting state.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice leans into purple prose ("horizon would invite night," "sleeping serpents") that distances the reader from the immediate scene. The reliance on poetic abstraction over concrete detail results in a lack of textural variation, making the prose feel static despite the movement in the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident and idiosyncratic, perfectly matching the "empirically whimsical" prompt. The terminology ("calibrated," "spectrograph," "matrices") is consistently applied to magical elements without breaking the spell. The tone manages to be both analytical and reverent, maintaining the hybrid lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical register, but the triple repetition of the phrase "rhythmically placid" creates a jarring, mechanical rhythm. This artifact suggests a forced inclusion of a prompt element that disrupts the natural cadence of the voice.

    Voice is lyric, rhythmic, and consistent—“nested awakenings rippled”—with selective, art-restorer perception. Compression and elision are taught early (“methodically playful”) and paid off in the final echoing laugh, meeting the 9-band threshold for patterned control.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is academic-rogue: Latinate “etymology” mashed with insurgent pollen packets; syntax lengthens under greenhouse humidity, then clips when auditors speak. Dialogue is coded action: “aphids are candid” = extraction team blown. No head-hop; Dr. Chen’s voice stays external, filtered through Aris’s stake. Compression like “candidly cryptic” is pattern-taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice sustains an incantatory cadence—long vowel currents, off-key wind as auditory signature—distinctive and stable within the poet’s exhausted, star-counting consciousness. Diction stays inside lyric poet lexicon: “nebulae,” “supernova remnants,” never drifts into academic gloss. Syntax mirrors narcotic sleeplessness with comma-bleeds and anaphora (“Across centuries of longing…”) that accelerate toward trance, then exhale in the final line. No dialogue to test, but the lullaby lyrics are integrated as ambient text, not quoted speech, keeping vocal purity intact; the slight risk of monotony is intentional, rewarded.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is crystal: translucent shelves, frozen-tear petals, foxglove regret—diction stays inside Lyra’s lexicon of delicate decay. Rhythm modulates with task: short noun clusters when she hums, longer liquid lines for dawn light. No head-hopping; single POV holds. One template cadence (“the echo of a long-forgotten song” repeated thrice) prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric, slightly elevated diction suits arcane linguist POV and is sustained (“symphonies of truth,” “cathedral halls of memory”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Crow-quill dip and pneumatic whoosh supply tactile rhythm. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: Kess’s cracked disuse versus Elara’s precise clauses. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Alia’s perceptual signature—callused hands, magnifying lens, volcanic haze—without head-hop; rhythm modulates from slow exhalations to quickened heartbeats under pressure, maintaining coherent distance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric compression taught in first paragraph—“sunlight sliced,” “column of swirling dust”—and sustained: syntax mirrors tightrope breathlessness. Perceptual signature is bird-trainer precise (counting motes, wings “soft shout”), no head-hop. Final whispered lyric modulates without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a hypnotic, prism-slanted cadence that mirrors the terrace’s slow drift. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon—corn silk, grain, brittle pages—avoiding register drift. Patterned repetition (“the threshold… the threshold…”) is taught early and paid off in the shimmer-dissolve, so it reads as ritual pulse, not template churn. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: every object is filtered through maze-geometry and weather-code star charts.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is saturated with oceanic diction (briny, salt-soaked, iridescent) yet stays precise; syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under revelation. No dialogue to distort register. POV remains tightly interior; perceptual signature skews toward chromatic noticing—every glitter is emotion-coded. Compression is lyrical but pattern is taught early (“sea-foam recollectionist” sets the contract) and paid off in the foam-spray finale.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is crystalline, analytical, yet lyrical—“serenade monotony with creativity” rings as personal credo, not slogan. Syntax mirrors tactical rhythm: long accumulative clauses build schemes, then fracture into staccato confirmations (“It happened now”). Perceptual signature is distinctively Ezra’s—geometry overlays emotion, starlight becomes data. No dialogue to test, yet internal diction stays consistent and pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains tidal cadence and starlit lexicon without register drift; “salt of forgotten seas,” “obsidian grace” are POV-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, coastal-quiet, with glass-bright diction that stays within a craftsman’s lexicon. Rhythm undulates like water, employing anaphora and clause-stacking that mirror ring patterns—an effective pattern-teach. Free-indirect glide is seamless; no head-hop or register drift. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice carries full load and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric distance remains stable, ventriloquizing Elara’s fire-sharpened perceptual signature—“fire’s language,” “rice-paper scars,” “hard softness.” Syntax mirrors her gait: long clauses climb the ridge, then fracture into short, white-hot images at beats of regret. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is preserved. The only micro-slippage is one line of diagnostic self-talk, but voice re-centers instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: “sonic fossils,” “frequency of suppressed knowledge,” “harmonic of guilt” all filter through Mira’s professional ear. Rhythm modulates with intensity—compressed clauses under pressure, longer cadences during red-dark development. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Register stays within a cartographer’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric achieves a consistent dusky cadence; long vowel-rich sentences mirror the lullaby’s hum without monotony. Perceptual signature is painterly—light trails, color eddies—anchoring POV inside an artist’s retina rather than omniscient canopy. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is waived. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor vehicles stay within optic physics (droplets, prisms, glimmers), preventing purple drift. Rhythm breathes with bell-cycles, accelerating just before each toll, a sophisticated control that nudges the 9-threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person omniscient hovers close to negotiator; perceptual signature—“forgotten promise,” “silent ballet”—is lyrical yet consistent. No head-hopping; distance stable. Compression in final paragraph is purposeful, cadence slowing to match exit rhythm. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric maintains atmospheric distance yet filters every perception through Vesper’s ruthless-sentimental bias: “fractured grace,” “bruised sky,” “echo of extinct birds” repeat with pattern-taught cadence that climaxes in the single cracked note. No head-hop; diction stays elevated but within a collector-aesthete’s lexicon. Rhythm breathes with thunder lulls, propelling the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lush, cadenced third-person lyric stays stable; perceptual signature is Elara’s synesthetic ear for “spaces between notes.” Metaphors are stacked yet patterned (snow = syllables, starlight = prism) so density reads as taught design, not clutter; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person camera stays locked to Adrian with disciplined psychic distance; perceptual signature—the calligrapher who “traced phantom serifs in the air”—threads urbane diction (“gilt letters,” “counterfeit reality”) into every observation. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer, ink-smooth sentences collapse into staccato puppet directions, mirroring the tightening noose of silence. No head-hopping; even audience realizations are filtered through Adrian’s sensing of their stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is irreducibly Esme’s: scientific diction (“thermal currents,” “vectors”) collides with lyrical compression (“blushing stillness,”“rose-gold apology”) in a perceptual signature unique to an esoteric realist. Syntax lengthens under reflection, fragments under exertion—“She knotted a thread…tethering it”—mirroring her pulse. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; even “she recognized” is immediate sensory recognition, not retrospective labeling. The prose itself performs transient rootedness: every metaphor dissolves into the next, never settling.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyrical third-person hovers at intimate distance; syntax grows longer under aurora awe, shorter under tactile threading—rhythm mirrors attention. “Technically gentle” becomes a percussive refrain, welding vocation to identity. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays caster-centric—she notices grain of cardboard, choke of frozen soot. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in interior line—feels academic but appears outside peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric, accumulative voice taught in first sentence (“storm wouldn’t wait…neither could she”) and sustained; syntax mirrors obsessive vine-counting rhythm. Perceptual signature concrete: Mara reads tendrils as timelines, dreams as groundwater—specific to her scholar-jester lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under storm but remains coherent. Filter verbs used sparingly and motivation-driven (“she saw,” “she woke”)—do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter—astronomer’s lexicon, beggar’s budget, stylus rhythm. Syntax lengthens during mapping beats, shortens at activation: cadence mirrors pressure. No dialogue needed; interior diction never drifts into modern academic register. Prose itself becomes schematic prayer, sustaining dusky harmony without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—silver breath, color-as-music—without head-hop.

One register lift—“conceptual repricing”—leans academic but occurs outside peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person permeable to Kael’s glass-grinder idiom: “calloused from grinding glass,” “glacier's memory.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—single breath-length sentences during mirror seating—then widens into lyric cadence for transfiguration. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at middle distance, filtering perception through mender’s tool-sight and wiry humor. Syntax stays lean, then flowers only at climax (“soft splash of color against the gray bark”). Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: daughter’s “Why do you still carry that old thing?” sounds adolescent; mother’s reply is proverb-coining. No head-hopping; distance tightens naturally as crisis crests.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Evers’s perceptual filters: “his steps echoing,” “fragments whispered.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under shock; diction remains within his curator lexicon yet stretches to cosmic scale without register drift. No head-hopping; surveillance drones are externalized only as privacy rationale. The lyric pattern (“simply complicated,” “between first and last page”) is taught early and paid off in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is sonic-tactile—“brittle pages,” “perfume of forgotten herbs,” “muted brass” eyes. Syntax lengthens under pressure—“Together they navigated the labyrinth, following the subtle harmonies”—mirroring cautious descent. No dialogue to test, yet internal diction stays within plausible linguist lexicon. One micro-loop: “unheard symphony” is repeated four times; because the pattern is taught early and reprised at closure, it reads as intentional motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction is consistent, slightly elevated but justified by fairytale tone. Rhythm modulates with discovery—short phrases on stairs, longer coils in garden. No dialogue to fault. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay physical. Voice feels singular and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—spectroscopic analysis, cataloging contradictions—without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s perceptual signature—ripple-reading, chest-cavity resonance—remains distinct and rhythmic; diction stays within her lexicon. Compression is purposeful (“bloom of hush” taught early); no head-hopping; lyric fragments serve acoustic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice carries a sustained lyric cadence that modulates with altitude—“thistle-blown hope” compresses to “a low thrum that matched her heartbeat.” Perceptual signature is custodian-specific: she notices star-paint erosion, shard hush, wind frequency. Compression like “discordant shards that hummed against the silence” teaches the texture early and pays off at the silent-light climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to the archivist’s perceptual syntax: “stormlight, neither sun nor moon but weather’s own pulse.” Filter verbs are few and motivated; diction remains within her scholarly lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains a consistent lyric distance that can compress to “stubborn spark within” without overstepping Cinder’s lexicon. Syntax grows breathless under pressure—“The fire spun in a helix, a dancer of light”—yet stays anchored in concrete verbs. Perceptual signature is distinct: Cinder notices wind-borne ceramic percussion and kerosene ghosts on her fingers, not tourist-catalog botany. No head-hop, no filter-verb clusters; rhythmic repetition of “She smiled” is intentional cadence rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV hovers close to Mara’s perceptual filter—starlight as “liquid silver,” grooves of time in jade—maintaining consistent psychic distance. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, compresses at the brother’s quiet line, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; brother’s interior is rightly inferred from shadow and voice. One clause of elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) slips in—“the essence of transition periods”—but remains within her chronicler idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence—sentence lengths vary, clause stacks create forward tilt (“fractured dome…fractured spectra”).

Filter verbs minimal; perception is concrete (“her bootsteps echoing”). Final line achieves Charged Poise: “Until sunrise came again” crystallizes cycle without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by the first sentence’s compressed metaphor and sustained through patterned breath cadences without drumbeat monotony. Perceptual signature is distinct: the keeper notices texture of absence—blurring threshold, weight of silence—never expository. POV remains tight single; no head-hop. Compression like “loaded emptiness” is reweighted at closure, paying off elision. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, voice-true.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays close to Kael’s perceptual filter—flicker of phone, grain of bolt, hiss of air. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for cavern awe, staccato for glitch texts.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “smell of oil and burnt wire,” “crystalline face catching light” are tinkerer-specific. Syntax mirrors gear rhythm—parallel phrases, ticking cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullets N/A. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One micro-POV slip: “the admiral had believed” is a touch omniscient, but the reflection is anchored to her handling of the compass, so forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric compressed to alchemist’s perceptual register: concrete remembers its liquid self for three heartbeats. Syntax mirrors metallurgic process—long furnace sentences, short quench fragments.

Lyric compression is patterned from line 1 (“sky turned the color of bruised plums”) and paid off in final harmonic chord. No head-hopping or register drift; filter verbs are sparse. Occasional velvet overload (“sacredly playful curiosity”) edges toward mannerism but stays legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter—only his heels, scars, and spatial math. Distinct rhythmic signature: Latinate diction (“interregnum, penumbra”) counter-pointed by monosyllabic steps (“r-e-m-e-m-b-e-r”). No head-hopping; prisoner’s interior is rendered only through observable blink and hand-mark. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“the gallery caught his steps”). Final cadence mirrors opening, teaching the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly aligned to Mira’s perceptual filter: every noun is chosen for metallic, reflective, or textural resonance. Rhythm accelerates with short pulse clauses during glyph-tracing, then exhales into longer cadences at dawn. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains singular. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are minimal and voice-motivated; patterned elision of articles feels intentional and is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical third-person floats close to the tutor’s perceptual signature—“threads shimmered like platinum,” “fingers…began to fidget productively”—with rhythmic, clause-varied syntax that mimics chess calculation. No dialogue to distort voice; narrative diction stays within the tutor’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. The metaphor chain is dense, yet patterned early and paid off at the glowing dissolution of the labyrinth, so it reads as taught compression rather than overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Perceptual signature is vivid: Kael reads the canyon as canvas, notices “calcium-white monoliths,” feels “forged hush that felt more like a held scream.” Diction stays painterly without purple drift; syntax lengthens in calmer beats, tightens at the glass burst (“He hurled…”). Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext—Mara’s empty hands speak louder than props.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is alchemist-poet: “edge of oblivion her only altar” marries vocation to dread. Syntax grows shorter as oxygen thins, matching hypoxic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s painterly perception: “colors muted by time but still vivid in his mind.” Syntax grows shorter under peak pressure—“He dipped the brush… With each stroke…” mirroring breath-holding. No head-hopping; diction stays within coastal, artistic lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“he felt intimately aloof”) rather than intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: Elara reads “shoulder tightening” and “knuckle whitening” as Morse code; Marcus hears silence “through his chest.” Rhythm flexes from long fever-sentence to staccato dawn clauses, mirroring heat break. No head-hop; single POV holds. Compression like “the scream of his tenderness” is patterned early and paid off when he actually whispers. Diction stays within keeper lexicon—no Latinate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature strong: “black tide lapping,” “rust tongues of old speakers,” diction metallic yet grief-laden. Rhythm compresses under deadline—“midnight call, seventh night, Now”—then lengthens into quiet final sentence. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Kael. Filter verbs minimal; syntax mirrors solder-flick precision.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice carries a scientist’s precision—“measured incision,” “archive of discredited textbooks”—yet lets storm-groaned trees leak mythic dread, creating a hybrid cadence that suits the premise. Compression is purposeful: “splinter I could not swallow” renders the curse viscerally. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent—every noticed detail either hides or reveals the eye’s power. Occasional elevated diction (“occlude its gaze”) feels like conscious ritual language rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Cornelius; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is lighthouse-grade: distances measured in beam sweeps, smells ranked by salt content. Rhythm tightens with fragment-like sense bursts under mist. Diction remains inside 19th-century keeper lexicon—no corporate register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice purity is judged on narrative lens alone and passes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited retains a cartographer’s perceptual signature: coastlines, cartography, ant-topography. Syntax lengthens and compresses with claustrophobia—cavern “breathes,” sentences widen. Filter verbs are few; diction stays within an antiquarian’s lexicon. No dialogue to corrupt voice; no head-hop. The lyric list of nectar-dripping stalactites risks purple but is saved by POV wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-liminal lyric voice sustains courtly diction—“silk slippers already soaked,” “stone teeth”—while compressing under altitude: sentences fragment into breath-spaced phrases mirroring thin-air hypoxia. No head-hop; camera stays inside the queen’s frost-narrowed perception. Patterned repetition (“lacy menace… dangerous lace”) is taught early and pays off when the same lace becomes the coronet of star-embers. Rhythm modulates from processional cadence to staccato gasp, aligning with ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice sustains a scientifically romantic register—cosmic vocabulary (density, star-heartbeat, alloy) kept tethered to tactile verbs (stitched, mixed, sealed). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for awe, clipped whispers for secrecy. No head-hop; POV stays anchored in the alchemist’s perceptual bias. Minor register lift in “catalyst for presence” is earned by prior diction groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric, compressive voice teaches its pattern early (“wrapped in cotton,” “watercolors in rain”) and sustains perceptual signature; no head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly fuses Elena’s anosmic bias into metaphorical diction that climaxes in the tactile screw-chain moment.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, matching scholar’s precision: “saturated hush,” “latent ink,” “library of light.” Rhythm modulates—long breath-held sentences under storm-silence, then shorter clauses as ink fractures. Crow-quill superstition is POV-bound childhood memory, not exposition. No dialogue, so voice must carry perceptual signature alone; it does. Purposeful repetition (“held her breath” twice) teaches pattern and pays off in final exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual bias—she smells guilt where Linden smells roses—yet diction never exceeds her lexicon of music and gossip. The rhythmic lift of metaphor (“fermata that holds a note before the axe falls”) is voice-motivated, not ornamental. No head-hopping; Linden’s interior is inferred only through observable softenings. Compression such as “ethereal grit” is taught early and paid off in the final hush-plus-chainsaw dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-philosophic yet consistent: controlled hypotaxis, cosmic diction, recursive cadences teach the reader early. Elision (“the cosmic illusions had not ended…”) is pattern-taught by the second sentence and stays legible. No head-hopping; single witness POV holds. Psychic distance compresses under stress—sentence fragments appear only in the final surrender—matching the hush frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is engineer-mystic: gears as friends, “bellows sighed, releasing compressed time,” diction precise yet slightly archaic. Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences during key-turn climax, then lengthens into the final breath—matching heartbeat cadence. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative voice only; it passes the 9+ test for distinct texture and controlled elision.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is perceptually signature: Kael’s “spatially gifted” mind renders breaches as “three-dimensional sculpture of light and shadow,” a synesthetic idiom consistent throughout. Rhythm swells and contracts with discovery—short bursts at 4:47 AM, longer reflective cadences by 7:15 AM, mirroring the slow cyan pulse. No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs are active (“spore-laced air cool against their face”). Final paragraph’s quiet wildfire metaphor modulates tone without register drift, remaining inside Kael’s calibrated lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Lila’s perceptual filter—probability ratios surface in everyday graffiti—without head-hop.

Diction stays within a mathematician’s lexicon; “hidden Markov chain” is used, not explained, trusting context.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice carries a hushed, metronomic cadence that mimics subway air and rotary ticks—“between the hum of streetlamps… the tunnel sighed with ancient iron.” Syntax is controlled, clauses layering like iron strata without drum-beat monotony. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices vibration, glass, breath, never touristic visuals. One POV, no leakage; psychic distance tightens from detached observation to embodied pain as glass slices her palms.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays close to archivist’s preservative perceptual filter; diction (“salt-kissed twilight,” “walnut-inked pages”) is rhythmically compressed yet legible.

Peak stress shows in fragmentary “haunted euphoria,” a micro-shift that heightens without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrative voice carries a lyrical, slightly elevated diction (“polite anarchy,” “harmonious resonance”) that remains internally consistent for an omniscient teller. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ivy-draped exposition, staccato triplets for rumor propagation, gentle cadence for lullaby closure. No head-hopping; focalization stays panoramic yet anchored to Mira’s exit. Filter verbs are few and purposeful; perceptual signature favors sound over sight, matching the blind resident’s authority.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)

Minor filter-verb clusters (“he realized,” “he understood”) appear but do not contaminate peak beats; rhythm control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: moonlight “silvered every wave,” harbor smells “of forgotten things”—diction is his, not tour-guide. Rhythm modulates: long, tidal sentences for stasis; short fragments when advisor appears (“She was old in the way ancient trees are old”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Patterned elision (“between-places where mist and memory blurred”) is taught early and paid off at closure, satisfying experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric close-in stays consistently filtered through Mira’s dancer-perception: verbs pirouette, light “traces arcs,” horizon “shimmers.” Syntax mirrors breath and wave rhythm; no head-hop. Diction within lexicon of a dockworker who secretly names the world in choreography. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy maintained even in guardian dissolution. Whale-call and brine scent operate as sensory signature rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinctively Kaelen’s (sound as tactile landscape, light as molasses). Syntax lengthens and breathes during harmonic discovery, then compresses into sharp declaratives under Mara's challenge, showing pressure-responsive modulation. No dialogue contamination; when Mara speaks, her cadence is clipped, youthful certainty contrasting Kaelen’s sonorous interior monologue. Free indirect style stays clean: “she suspected its irregular curvature might bend...echo” reads as internal inference, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains jewel-maker perceptual signature: light refraction, translucence, chemical perfection. Prose rhythm mirrors folding cadence—clause layering like paper creases—then loosens in final dissolving sentences. No dialogue; narrative register stays within Elara’s craft lexicon. One minor template cadence (“genuinely artificial and…” repeated) slightly dulls texture, but pattern is taught early and serves motif.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught in the first sentence: “sharp-eyed dusk noticer.” Metaphor density stays high but rhythm stays deliberate, not algorithmic; sentence lengths swell then contract with dusk deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; even the stars are “liquid silver” because she needs soft light, not astronomy. Syntax lengthens under grief, then fractures into short instrumental verbs (“mixed,” “lifted,” “brushed”) during the salve scene, mirroring her narrowing focus. No dialogue, so voice distinction is tested solely within interiority and passes. The controlled repetition of “tail tip” becomes rhythmic incision, not template drum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric-accumulative voice is consistent: rhythmic parallelisms, syntactic echoes (“the quiet tower… the meteor hush… the frosted hourglass”) teach their own pattern. Perceptual signature is biased toward texture and slow geologic time—fitting plant-telepathy and stone-miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person omniscient stays tight to fiddler’s perceptual signature: sound-first, metaphor of music-as-language, synesthetic “pixelated night.” Rhythm mirrors breath: long lyrical sentences in calm, staccato fragments under discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Scaffold wrap “Morse code” phrase is repeated with rising urgency, pattern taught and paid off. Register stable—poetic yet grounded in mountain idiom. 9+ quick test met: perceptual signature distinct, rhythmic control heightens closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is astronomer-poet—“photonic amber,” “phonetic keys”—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for trance, staccato for final keystroke. No dialogue, so voice carries all melodic burden; compression like “temple of silence” is taught early and paid off at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is druidic—circles, ash taste, seed whisper—without ventriloquism. Syntax flexes with pressure: clipped cadence at seed-planting, longer coils during chant. No head-hop; knowledge stays character-bound. One micro distance slip—“confession tasting of bitter betrayal” momentarily abstracts taste into metaphor, but recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined—syntax coils like hedge-maze, diction stays within visionary lexicon (“dreamstuff,” “starlight and regret”).

Filter verbs minimal and motivated; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited voice stays coherent; perceptual signature is music-centric (echo, encore, rhythm) and syntax modulates with emotional crests; no dialogue to test subtext, but interior lyricism avoids filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is stable lyric-third distant, filtered through Elara’s translator mind: “a missing tooth in the city’s hum,” “wedge into the question itself.” Syntax mirrors magnetic curvature—long sentences bend, then snap in short carved beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains her tactile-linguistic prioritization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice fuses mechanical precision (“tessellated floor,” “annular furnace”) with sensuous lyricism (“smelled of living water,” “sunlight on skin”). Compression taught early: “gears storing moments tomorrow could no longer hold” signals elliptical lyric mode. Rhythm modulates—long tidal sentences vs. staccato “Let them be fish” triad—mirrors lunar shift.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)

Patterned repetition (“resonant hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure when the caves literally resonate. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“seemed to warm”) reflecting instrument-trained caution.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Mira’s medicated hyper-perception: “every sound felt like a needle,” “red ink like wounds.” Rhythm pulses with clause-variation and breath-length fragments that mimic accordion draw. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; perceptual signature stays consistent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“raw solace,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds POV lexicon but reads as intentional incantatory heightening.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric POV stays locked to the dreamer; perceptual signature is haunting, cadenced, fog-soft. Diction—"propagation delays," "cyclically reversed sequence"—leans technical yet remains anchored in her note-taking gaze. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for mist, staccato ticks for watch. No dialogue to test naturalism. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are coherent rather than mixed. Voice does not merely describe but thinks in images, matching the accumulative lens. Slight risk in abstract diction never breaks clarity. High control, distinct texture, closure paid off in mist-and-echo cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV maintains steady psychic distance; free indirect style dips cleanly (“She feared it would vanish…”). Perceptual signature is botanically slanted—every leaf murmurs, night-blooming jasmine “whispered secrets”—creating a consistent lyric texture. No head-hopping; envoy’s voice briefly surfaces through Lira’s filter. Prose rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments at envoy’s arrival. Diction stays within scholarly yet sensorial lexicon, no register drift.

Filter verbs serve voice: “she understood” is earned after decade of hate and seventeen harvests. Register stays rural-mythic without drifting into academic or therapy idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person voice is stable, lyric, and perceptually specific: “wisp of smoke to curl,” “bruised horizon.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ascent, matching breath. No dialogue, so voice convergence is N/A. Diction stays within the narrator’s contemplative register; occasional elevated Latinate choices (“reverie,” “spectrum”) feel intentional to the philosophical tilt. Compression in campfire-to-lighthouse transition is taught by the reflective cadence and pays off in the final prism.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric, visionary register is sustained without register drift; diction stays inside a mind that has lived time backward (“the grotto answered with a soft magnetic sigh”). Rhythmic control heightens at closure: short clauses mimic fading pulses. No head-hop; single focalizer holds. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt the magnetic grotto’s pulse”) and compress sensory layers rather than dull them.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lyric-accumulative voice teaches its pattern early—“longer than dust remembered”—and sustains incantatory rhythm without monotony. Perceptual signature is vivid: wind “turned into endless echoes,” time “grew thick with memory.” Compression and ellipsis are consistent, and closure line lands with tonic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in compressed lyric cadence and alchemical diction (“stratopause,” “unstrap sequence,” “brilliant dimness”).

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—static hiss makes teeth ache, coins warm to heartbeat. Rhythmic control mirrors mounting resonance: longer sentences for cosmic scale, fragment bursts under static peaks. No dialogue, so naturalism/subtext skipped. Lexicon stays within plausible arcane-astronomer range; “wavelength align” is scene-motivated jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice carries a hush-of-death cadence, syntax elongating like dusk shadows, then compressing under each crystallized fear. Perceptual signature—brass cold, wax hiss, light broken gold—remains consistent and character-bound. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Register stays within a centuries-old reaper’s elegiac lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays inside Kael’s perceptual filter: he notices dew, drip cadence, bronze temperature, not tourist vistas.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is alchemical-mythic (“silver apples hummed with captive moonlight”). Syntax modulates: longer incantatory sentences for wonder, fragment-like perception under transformation. Diction stays within elevated but character-apt register; no head-hop. Occasional poetic overgrowth but justified by voice and paid off in closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyric-technical, consistent diction—data pulse, arbor, pattern seeker—tuned to lone sentinel’s precision. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences under stars, staccato clicks during override. Compression taught early (“soundless echo”) and repaid in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited ghost POV is stable; diction stays within a yard-conductor’s lexicon (“stuttering machine,” “broken kazoo choir”). Rhythm lengthens during wind swells, contracts in whisper releases, mirroring breath the dead no longer need. Perceptual signature vivid: sound as color, wind as dental drill or lullaby. No head-hop; filter verbs (“felt,” “heard”) justified by incorporeal state. Dialogue absent—appropriate, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to guardian’s alien sensorium: syntax elongates like breath in frost, verbs favor tongue-touch and claw-scrape. No head-hop; cultist remains a silhouette outside veil. Patterned elision (“a light that belonged to no sky it remembered”) is taught early and paid off in final door-from-mist. Only micro-slip: one near-philosophic noun string (“the boundary of light…where vision itself became meaningless”) momentarily lifts register above beast-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—silver shards “between her palms,” embers “like frozen stars.” Syntax mirrors alchemical precision: successive fragments imitate approximation steps.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric, compressed diction stays within Mara’s lexicon; “somber marvel” modulates from hush to crystalline bioluminescent pulse; perceptual signature is selective—pressure tug, metallic taste, spectral refraction—without head-hop; rhythmic acceleration under final meditation beat mirrors unfolding horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: sound is texture, light is viscosity. Syntax elongates in misty clauses then fractures at the glass crash, mirroring auditory focus. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. The occasional ornate phrase (“reeling hush”) is repeated without pattern payoff, a hairline slip that keeps the score under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close keeps perceptual signature oceanic: “crashing hush,” “compressed spaces…closing fists,” prose rhythms that mimic internal pressure. No head-hopping; augments filter sensory input consistently. Compression and elision (“seven seconds”) are taught early and paid off.

Filter verbs minimal; immediacy preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: metallic, mineral, avian lexicon refracted through a poet-engineer of sound. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses during ascent to staccato fragments at the moment of translation (“each turn a consonant, each swoop a vowel”).

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains resonantly soft cadence that mirrors violin tone; long vowel echoes (“resonantly soft cry / ember / fell”) pattern-taught by paragraph two and paid off in final hush. Perceptual signature is musician: world rendered in rhythm, timbre, syncopation. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight behind Elara’s ribs. Filter verbs (“she realized,” “she felt”) cluster during epiphany beats but serve interior music; acceptable at climax. One micro-drift: “crystalline moment between heartbeat and thought” nears abstract, slightly dilutes concrete ear.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings to the courier’s sensorium: boots click, satchel clinks, neon pulses “like a heartbeat” under his gaze. Syntax is clipped under drone-launch pressure, then widens for the emotional exhale. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. One clause drifts toward editorial—“a respectfully rebellious figure”—but the rest earns the label through shown behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Silas’s perceptual filter: attention to creak, gleam, brass, never abstract labels. Syntax is compressed, carpenter-precision: “hands told stories in the creak of wood.” Rhythm accelerates at carousel re-awakening, mirroring spin. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; silence is honored at line level.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves a distinct perceptual signature: metrics whisper at “exactly the right angle,” elegies hide inside differential equations. Syntax warps with curvature—“the library inhaled”—mirroring content. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are deployed as sensory anchors (“she noticed,” “she discovered”) rather than immediacy diluters, and the pattern is taught early, paid off when perception degrades into origin-reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: time measured in “hollow pulse of the card catalog,” light as “borrowed,” islands as punctuation. Syntax flexes with pressure—short declaratives at summit, elongated clauses during dissolve. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught in first paragraph and paid off in final “hush of improbable beginnings.” Register stays within librarian’s poetic lexicon; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric sustained with locksmith-specific perceptual signature: “she read hints in starlight,” “cosmic hush,” “key that turns without belonging.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for twilight, clipped fragments at release.

No dialogue to contaminate voice; prose itself becomes the spoken spell.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV remains stable, perceptual signature tied to Elias’s metric, star-minded gaze: angles, maps, constellations pattern his noticing. Diction—“phosphorescence that matched the lagoon’s bioluminescent plankton”—is precise, sensory, and consistent with a field-record folklorist. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives under night-time measuring, longer lyrical cadence during memory flood, mirroring cognitive load. Filter verbs minimal; free-indirect slips slightly in “He understood now” but recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers close to archivist, filtering every detail through her perceptual signature: dust motes “hold breath,” swing echoes laughter only she hears. Syntax mirrors her reversible habit—“circles the reading table...in reverse”—creating rhythmic signature. Diction stays within lexicon of archivist-poet: “shard-mirror,” “geometry of tea,” never academic. Free indirect clean: “exile is a door that swings both ways” reads as her lived maxim, not narrator intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice remains stable, its diction filtered through Vespera’s synesthetic precision—“frequencies that capture joy.” Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric cadences for the weaving marathon, then clipped fragments at collapse. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is measured through perceptual signature alone, which passes. The reversed-waterfall fragment is a taught syntactic rupture, not unmotivated slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s scar-filtered perception. Syntax elongates during unraveling, then snaps into short declaratives at the pearl’s reveal, mirroring breath release. No head-hopping; prism refractions are perceived, not explained. Distinct perceptual signature: every glint of light is a sailor’s laugh or father’s promise—hallucination as optical fact.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is map-maker precise: “each brushstroke a quiet question,” “cracked plaster” read like shoreline. Rhythm clusters soften under empathy—long vowels in “vaulted silence” mirror the chapel’s hush. No head-hopping; single POV stays inside Elena’s fingertip-level attention. Compression taught early—“whispered chapel” is oxymoron that pays off when she literally hears nothing yet feels addressed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Cassian’s perceptual signature—every metaphor is measurable: turbulence, viscosity, logarithmic decay—creating a scientist’s lyric. Mort’s dialogue is sparse, indirection-heavy (“You’re untangling threads that don’t want to be untangled”), distinct from Cassian’s murmured equations. No head-hopping; Mort’s interior is never ventriloquized, only cooled water and sly timing. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: the final ascent is almost telegraphic, syntax tightening like oxygen thinning.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, wind-attentive perceptual signature; diction stays spare and musical, avoiding purple overload. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“driftingly alert”) are taught early and paid off in the floating closure. Dialogue is absent by design; prose rhythm modulates from lull to crescendo without drum-beat monotony. Voice distinction is high for a single-focalizer piece, meriting low-8 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to Kai’s perceptual beam: “calloused fingers,” “bitter tea” echo professional tactile life. Rhythm swells with altitude—long clauses at floor one, clipped fragments by floor ten, mirroring breath shortening under emotional load. No head-hopping; captain’s interior arrives only as authored text, legally framed artifact. Filter verbs (“seemed to shift”) are motivated by optical uncertainty, not hedging. Syntax is servant-precise, mirroring the “geometric precision” the captain adored.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited remains tightly glued to Mara’s perceptual filter—brass cold, cloud emotion lexicon, insect-wing recorder click.

Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for starlings, staccato pencil stroke for discovery. No register drift or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyric-cosmic, sustaining syntactic rhythm across long sentence waves that mimic eclipse cycles. Perceptual signature is consistent: the locksmith notices metallic breath, gear teeth, mirror frost—tools of her metier. No head-hopping; the camera stays inside her mythic awareness. Register remains elevated but motivated by the celestial library frame; compression under pressure appears in the clipped "She turned it gently, feeling the click of ages."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric communal voice sustains consistent cadence; diction leans pastoral-philosophical without purple drift. Patterned repetition ("they gathered," "they understood") teaches its choral rhythm early and pays off in final hush. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is avoided; perceptual signature is collective, not individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric-oracular yet concrete: syntax elongates then fractures in mimicry of spiral collapse (“nested patterns of possibility, each spiral folding into smaller spirals”). Diction stays within adjuster’s ontological lexicon—she names time-shells, glass dial, pane of hush—never academic. Rhythm modulates: longer anaphoric clauses ascend the stairs; staccato fragments mark the final spindle touch. No dialogue, so no register drift; perceptual signature is obsessively haptic, never visual-only.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric-cinematic, compressed but never generic: “whispering grove,” “clockwork birds whose bronze wings caught the last light.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s offhand precision—long sensorial sentences that snap into tight placement clauses. No head-hopping; POV stays interior to Elara. Non-standard compression (“graceless beauty”) is taught early and paid off in the final tone.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves consistent perceptual signature: polymer vocabulary refracted through water, music, and grief. Syntax lengthens and compresses with river rhythm; diction stays within a scientist-poet lexicon. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she saw fleeting arabesques”) they serve POV camera. Final “hummed a tune only the river could answer” crystallizes voice without external ventriloquism. Hairline slip: “symphonically minded soul” is borderline label, but embedded early and re-cast as sensory beat, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers at vendor’s shoulder, perceptual signature attuned to light, glass, and negative space.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice is bone-specific: “tasted memories… metallic, cold, stale bread and ash.” Syntax mirrors task—analytic when decoding pools, cadenced when kneading.

Register never drifts above chef’s earthy lexicon; rhythm breathes with physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s choral ear: cadences swell and taper like breath, matching the musical premise. Elevator voices are distinguished by language, age register, and grain (Klaus’s baritone vs. Ania’s bright soprano) without caricature. No head-hopping; focalization remains anchored. Occasional loftiness—“under the hush of borrowed starlight” repeated—risks self-parody but stays within fairy-tale contract.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is hypnotic, helix-wound: long sentences coil, then snap into fragments ("This was not gentle change") that mirror synaptic firing. Lexicon stays within the engineer’s plausible register—"synaptic plasticity protocols," "ontological substrate"—yet remains sensuous. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure: the climax compresses into single-line pulses until the final sentence releases into spiraling DNA metaphor. No head-hop; perceptual signature is stable, hallucinatory yet precise.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual filter: archivist’s professional notice of condensation, glyph faintness, threshold flicker.

Voice is serviceable, not idiosyncratic—could swap for another competent archivist voice without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a musical cadence—long vowels, soft consonants, internal rhyme—matching the symphonic concept. Perceptual signature is consistent: attention to grain, glaze, sap, and hush never drifts into touristic catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is auditorial (“thin as starlight,” “static sang with meaning”). Syntax modulates—long lyrical coils contract into short notations—mirroring tuning precision. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Voice could risk higher if diction carried more idiosyncratic dents.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person stays close to Elias’s olfactory brain; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed smell tilts his mood or recipe. Syntax lengthens and softens during the hush moments, mirroring the calm he seeks. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet the journal’s compressed clauses (“stillness is not absence”) sound like a herbalist’s field notes. Only nit: “wildflower hush” is repeated thrice with identical cadence, risking mantra over music.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers at pilot-distance yet retains perceptual signature—attention to wind, water, and tool feedback. Prose rhythm modulates: long gliding sentences for ascent, staccato fragments inside cold arch (“Here was the attribute…”). No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Kael. Non-standard gravity grammar (“world began to fall upward”) is taught early and echoed at closure, keeping voice coherence intact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric yet precise: “prism-song bell ringer,” “oscillating repose”—neologisms taught by context and repeated until legible. Rhythm modulates withPressure: short declaratives during chisel strike, then flowing color-sound clauses as hush fractures. Perceptual signature is synesthetic, never generic: violet is “bronze hum,” green is “silver thread.” No head-hopping; distant sculptor remains opaque, seen only through Lyra’s aurora-tuned senses. Filter verbs are intentional (“she felt the weight lift”) to keep sensation primary.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close stays locked to the keeper’s perceptual filter: “gravel sang like broken glass” is sense-specific and vocation-colored. Syntax lengthens and compresses with tension—long sentences for trek, staccato fragments (“Heart pounding. The first note…”) at seam-opening. No head-hop; driftwood, flute, and canyon are seen only as he interprets them. The elevated diction (“avalanchingly quiet”) is earned by earlier acoustic setup and reads as heightened sensorium rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is a controlled lyric cadence—long, luminous sentences that mirror press strokes and star-fade. Diction stays within Cassian’s artisan lexicon (“ glyphs,” “damped oscillation”) without academic drift. Compression tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as the fragment dies, rhythm echoing faltering heartbeat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and paid off in the final “matrix of light and shadow.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person limited stays inside courier perception; perceptual signature is selective—aurora as silk ribbon, heartbeat resonance—without tourist catalog. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for wonder, clipped steps under tension. No head-hop; child’s interior is wisely left opaque. Filter verbs (“felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Non-standard punctuation absent; syntax mirrors auroral ebb/flow. Distinct texture sustained under pressure; closure line maintains pulse echo.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Seraphine’s perceptual filter—“colors…painted the quartz arbor walls”—without hedging. Syntax breathes with the shifted hush: longer cadences for mist inhalation, clipped fragments for instrument readings. No dialogue appears; voice coherence is judged on interior texture alone, and it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature—sound-stripped attention, loom-rhythm syntax. Compression (“she wove the puzzle pieces into the fabric”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to Mei. Diction stays within rural-Chinese loom spinner lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly sewn to Ren’s perceptual filter: “air tasted of forgotten promises,” “silk felt weightless, the color of twilight betrayed by dawn.” Syntax mirrors his hushed intensity—long cadences for reflection, hammer-clang fragments for defiance. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is bypassed. Diction stays within a blacksmith-poet lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinctive: sensory verbs (taste, ripple, shimmer), cyclically spontaneous cadence that mirrors shard pulse. Perceptual signature stays consistent—“sensory map maker” notices texture, metallic memory, heartbeat out of time. No dialogue, so no register clash; free-indirect style clean. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she realized,” “she understood”) dull immediality in two spots, not enough to breach 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays tight to Caleb’s taciturn perception; diction (“salt crust,” “flat stone”) is caretaker-plain, rhythm steady like surf. No dialogue, so voice hinges on sensory selectivity; occasional lyrical lift (“bloom like a small sun”) is earned and doesn’t rupture distance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient adopts a mythic register—temple bells cadence, long vowel music—that fits lighthouse-keeper-as-prophecy. Perceptual signature is star-filtered maritime mysticism: ink weight, hollow star-channel, silver thread. No head-hop; voice remains outside character but poetically consistent. Compression (“the world forgot the weight of ink”) teaches elliptical pattern that pays off in dawn-gold echo.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence that suits tea-house detachment; syntax favors comma-spliced reverie, taught early and paid off in closing sun-trail riff. Perceptual signature—iridescence, grinding, sun angles—is consistent and character-specific. No dialogue until the master and stranger’s brief exchange; lines are stylized but tonally coherent. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “would”) occasionally cushion immediacy, yet compression feels purposive rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile and custodial—“sweeping dust,” “smelled of salt and stardust.” Diction stays within Elara’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly glued to Mira’s perceptual filter—“enlarged tranquility,” “matryoshka dolls of meaning”—without slipping into editorial voice. Syntax mirrors her recursive thinking: long, clause-stacked sentences that circle back on themselves. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through textured narrative. Rhythm modulates: shorter sentences at 11:59 mark the final pulse before stepping through.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual signature: “ghost of yeast,” “yew that kept its own counsel.” Syntax lengthens with rue, contracts when she scoops soil—rhythmic control mirrors emotional cadence. No head-hopping; when the veteran kneels, we read his action through Mara’s watching, not his feelings. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence is carried through selective sensory diction.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric floats close to the chief’s perceptual filter—“needle flickering across a spectrum of forgotten colors”—syntax stays cool, measured, mirroring temperament. No head-hop; distance stable. Diction is restrained, avoiding purple burst even at climax: “pinpoint of light” is as heightened as it gets, keeping voice credible for an archivist. Rhythm slows with em-dashes and repeated sibilants to mimic frozen stasis, then tightens into shorter pulses during sampling beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: salt-memory, cork-whisper, singed sleeve—sensorium of a clandestine childhood. Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments like “Time pressed against my ribs” mimic heartbeat cadence. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on internal coherence; no head-hop or filter clutter. Patterned elision (“the truce of hush”) is taught early and paid off in the final tick, satisfying lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic gustatory perception colors every observation (“flavor of old decisions”). Syntax stays controlled under aurora pressure; no head-hop.

Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for lamplight studio, clipped fragments under ladder descent. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains plant-sensitive (curl, wilt, shimmer). Compression taught early—“conversations vanishing into the vents”—and paid off by reel hiss.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to the tuner’s perceptual bias—“blue breath of glaciers,” “hundred tiny sounds of her tunings.” Syntax coils like wind-girded beams, then fractures into clauses that mimic metallic resonance. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the child’s widening eyes are filtered through the tuner’s sonic ontology. Pattern-taught elision (“language had dissolved”) stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is mechanically lyrical—ceramic creak, servo tremble, golden sap—yet haunted by a child’s diction (“birthday cakes”). Patterned repetition of “strangely organic” is the only taught tic; it pays off when the android’s gait becomes fluid. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter verbs dull the spark. Under peak pressure diction compresses to single-word sentences (“Flame whispered”) without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person voice keeps perceptual signature crisp: Mira “reads secret histories in chipped porcelain,” a curator’s synesthetic lens.

Dialogue sparse but natural; Samir’s skateboard clicks anchor his age. Clean free-indirect style throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)

One filter-verb cluster “she could hear the spider’s silk whispering” is voice-motivated and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual signature—harbor mist slicks his palms, silence rings like weight. Rhythm modulates: long gravity-laden sentences drag, then fracture into crystalline shards at the climax. Diction within POV lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice evaluation rests on interior texture, which remains distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited holds steady inside Elias’s perceptions; diction—“crystalline tongue,” “smoothed hush”—is character-colored, not writerly flourish. Rhythm compresses under pressure (short clauses during final dip) then widens into dawn release, mirroring task fatigue. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; every metaphor is something Elias could plausibly think.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person stays tight to Alex’s architectural sensorium—walls “conjugate verbs,” water damage is “a lament”—creating a consistent perceptual signature. Mrs. Voss’s diction—“dead languages were my trade”—is distinct without caricature; her cadence is measured, theatrical, aligning with her ex-professor status. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under meteor shower urgency yet retains lyric pulse. Prose rhythm modulates from patient tea cadences to staccato basement beats, mirroring rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical-accumulative voice teaches its pattern early: sentence fragments (“Each petal heavy…”) mirror the staccato of fragmented sister-voice.

Distinct perceptual signature sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: ink as blood, light as silk, thorn as quill—metaphors stay within her craftsman idiom. Rhythm modulates with action: short shards during insertion, longer cadence during aurora reveal. No head-hopping; single focalizer holds. Compression like “time passed as stalactites drip” is taught early and stays consistent, earning its ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature: “walls humming with the secret song of the universe.” Syntax coils like the canyon—long vowel chains, anaphoric pulses—mirroring breath-based song. No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression and elision are taught early (“the canyon twisted…”) and remain legible at closure; no head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly attached to Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices “galley rivets like old bruises,” a diver’s gaze. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for breath-hold calm, fragments when ice cracks. No dialogue, so voice is carried by curbed metaphor (“starlight” pattern taught early and reprised at closure). Distinct texture holds under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test; only the refrain’s slight over-milk keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric third-person hovers at a stable psychic distance, filtering perception through the philosopher’s moon-biased attention; rhythmic repetition (“whispering,” “scintillatingly somber”) functions as patterned elision that pays off in the closing cadence, no head-hopping or register drift detected.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: “shredded letters smelled of earth and old panic” is a scent only he would parse. Syntax mirrors analytical mind—cumulative participles (“charting…noticing…watching”) mimic evidence stacking. No filter-verb bloat; perception rendered direct: “rad-count dropped” not “he noticed the rad-count drop.” Minor registry drift—“conceptual repricing” lexicon appears only in narration, not interior monologue, keeping distance clean.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature—“thunder gnawed at the observatory’s steel bones”—throughout. Syntax modulates with tension: longer clauses for static poetry, fragments for lightning strike. No head-hopping; distance stable. Non-standard grammar (“stormlit,” “frequency-lick”) is pattern-taught early and paid off. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric yet grounded: “sand and memory,” “honey and rust,” “invisible architecture of sound” all stay within the poet’s plausible lexicon while forging a distinct rhythmic signature. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices varnish like sunburn, labels jars with dates she never lived—never drifts into tourist-catalog. Compression (“air itself thickened with notes”) is taught early and paid off when she dips pen into that thickened air.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Violet-stained lyric third-person stays close inside her perceptual filter: “tasting bronze and winter,” “sound as ethereal hand.” Syntax compresses under stress—“Adapt or surrender: no third option”—then elongates during sonic duel, mirroring breath control. No head-hopping; focalization remains strict. Occasional elevated diction (“sonic absolution,” “sorrow’s geometry”) reads as guild jargon she would internalize, so register holds.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—instruments, azimuths, pressure ridges—without filter-verb bloat. Syntax mirrors her calibrated mind: clipped noun phrases (“magnetic viaduct arched,” “moon path crossed”) that breathe under pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the lyric-technical diction remains internally consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s forensic perceptual signature—rust depth, fracture angles, scuff direction—never drifting into omniscience. Syntax is controlled and purposeful: short percussive clauses during discovery, longer reflective cadence when the lantern recalls her grandmother. No dialogue appears; voice coherence is judged solely through interior diction, which remains consistent and character-bound. Lantern as extension of memory avoids object-as-prop cliché because its historical charge is earned through handled action and final re-coding of meaning.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere; no filler, no scaffold. Metaphors are spare—“water seeped like a slow breath”—and physically coherent. Rhythm modulates with pressure: staccato beat during bolt discovery, slowed cadence at exit. No loops, no register drift; the single technical term “portable gauge” is accurate and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited clings to the chaplain’s perceptual filter—dust motes as galaxies, spring-tension as moral barometer—syntax lengthens with his dread, then snaps short at the first clear note. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged within narration; Marlowe’s silence is rendered through the chaplain’s interpretation, maintaining coherent distance. Compression (“This is how we turn an apology into action”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is compressed lyric with metallic diction—“phosphor-coated grease,” “recursive loop that desired”—taught in sentence 1 and held to last line. POV stays tight third-single; no head-hop. Rhythm flexes: long cadence for machinery, staccato during resonator activation. Filter verbs minimal; perception filtered through cart-glider body. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence. Final repetition of “eternally curious, eternally ringing” reads as intentional mantra, not monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinctively textured: archivist precision ("corrupted data blocks") collides with lyric cadence ("stranded star," "chorus of absence"). Perceptual signature is consistent—sound-centric, data-metaphor—and rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening into shorter clauses at the vault breach. No dialogue to test; free-indirect style is clean. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("she noticed," "she realized") and serve the obsessive-attentive persona. The elevated diction fits the keeper’s arcane expertise without drifting into corporate jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric accumulation taught early—“shadows seeped between their fingers like ink”—establishes perceptual signature that modulates to calm vigilance by end. Compression is purposeful; no template cadence. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext in Elder Mara’s single nod, avoiding articulate committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical, consistent third-person intimate; perceptual signature filters every detail through vineyard-tending sensibility. No dialogue to stress-test voice; prose stays within lexicon. Occasional template cadence (“He wrote of… He sealed… He tucked…”) slightly flattens rhythm, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains mythic distance yet preserves perceptual signature: archivist notices “silver nitrate” not “black ink,” revealing archival training. Sentence rhythm lengthens during lingering, contracts at mention of machines humming again, echoing breath control. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible; prose carries subtext alone. Free-indirect folds seamlessly—“she could almost hear...”—without filtration clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Percussive, archaic diction (“lexical accumulation,” “fractured sequences”) mirrors Elias’ bibliophile mind without purple drift. Rhythm lengthens then fragments to mimic incoming voices; compression tightens under eviction countdown. Perceptual signature—book spines as dying bodies—remains consistent. No dialogue, so voice cohesion judged solely on narrative texture: flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature: optic vocabulary, tactile gear gleam, auditory leaf tick. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under clock-spin pressure, longer breath after cadence locks. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on diction and syntax; no head-hop. Filter verbs ("he knew") are voice-motivated, not intrusive. Distinctive compression: “luminous ache” recurs with accruing weight; pattern taught early, paid off in final whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is hushed, patient, Latinate-leaning (“luminous lattice,” “conceptual repricing”) that mirrors Elara’s deliberation; rhythm slows into longer sentences as loops close. No dialogue, so idiom and distance stay consistent. Perceptual signature is star-and-shadow obsessed, never generic. One clause drifts toward editorial uplift (“world could breathe a little easier”), but the bulk sustains restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elena’s perceptual filter: “yearning...more acutely,” “cleft in certainty.” Diction—“folklore forensics,” “conceptual repricing of night sky”—suits academic POV.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: tide-whisper, glass-heft, zephyr-bloom diction is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)

Syntax mirrors her rhythm—long pollen-heavy phrases, then abrupt drip-stop fragments. No head-hop; distance tightens from scenic to embodied as spiral nears completion. Register remains within her lexicon; no corporate leakage. 9+ quick test met: perceptual signature distinct, rhythm modulates under pressure, elisions (how she entered, where she sleeps) taught by pattern and paid off in final spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric-ritual voice sustains perceptual signature: coiling mist "like a question mark," kite-string fingers—metaphors stay specific to narrator’s sensibility. Syntax mirrors dream-logic compression; fragments ("Against the current...") are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register drifts slightly into workshop diction ("conceptual repricing" feel) once, but rhythm recovers. Tense stable; psychic distance controlled through sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric distance stays locked to the locksmith’s perceptual bias—every acoustic notice is oblique, never straight-on. Syntax mirrors tinkering precision: clause-stacked descriptions of angles and frequencies. Vocabulary (“chronomantic,” “refract rather than absorb”) stays within artisanal lexis. No head-hop; interior access limited to what a peripherally focused craftsman would articulate mid-task.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: rain beads are lenses, steam is a clock, ash is heavier than physics allows. Rhythm modulates with carve pressure—short clauses during chisel strikes, lengthened cadence during prism placement—without syntactic monotony.

Diction remains within a grieving crafts-person’s lexicon; “crystallized time” is introduced as folk magic she has read about, not authorial sleight.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature consistent: chronologic confusion rendered via drifting leaves, dissolving words, spinning wheel as clock. Syntax breathes with pressure—long cadences for lagoon hush, staccato clicks for heart sync. No head-hopping; unreliability is subtle (time slips) and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is precise: “liquid ribbon of amber and violet,” “windows dark as closed eyes.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, fragment-like repetitions for latch-click immediacy. No dialogue, so voice compression under stress appears in the staccato “She pressed the stone.” No head-hop; single POV holds. Register stays within Elara’s antiquarian lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays glued to Elara’s perceptual bias: she notices grafting syntax but not Kessler’s boat name, smells rope tar but not tea steam. Syntax lengthens and softens during decoding—“coaxed knowledge forward, not taking”—mimicking patient fiber glide; shortens at the reveal—“She recorded”—to mimic seed snap. Lexicon stays rural-literate: “sheepshank,” “Turk’s head,” “pollen counts” feel natural to her tongue. One micro-drift: “library of forgotten pollination cycles” momentarily lifts into academic register, but the surrounding texture absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)

Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: short clauses at hatch crack mirror tremor. Occasional elevated diction (“azure,” “aetherwing”) risks purple, but pattern is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices heat, scent, scar-silver, not tourist vistas. Syntax lengthens during song, compresses during binding, mirroring breath.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter: star-counting, breadcrumb pulse, glass whisper. Rhythm modulates—long breaths while waiting, staccato prepositional phrases during the hush—without drumbeat monotony. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. One lyrical leap—“memories spilled like liquid light”—is earned by prior setup and does not muddle causality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: patterned anaphora (“Across the quiet sigh…”) teaches its cadence early and pays off in the final reprise. Diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon—she can conceive “Turing machine made of stardust” because she literally lives inside it. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is color-sonar synesthesia unique to her translucent physiology. Minor over-milked adjectives (“phosphorescent,” “spectral”) but they serve the textural design, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person adheres to Kael’s perceptual filter: stone-dust, butterfly-wing syntax, ribbon-stitch diction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric floats close to the gardener’s perceptual filter—his whistle, hum, stained fingers—without leaking into omniscient exposition. Diction stays within a groundskeeper’s plausible lexicon; “velveteen gloom” is the single poetic reach, justified by repeated use. Rhythm mirrors the untangling motion: long sentences for knots, clipped fragments for release. No dialogue, so voice remains uninterrupted; syntax is varied, read-aloud smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers at Kaelen’s shoulder, anchored to her perceptual bias toward thermal gradients and fracture angles.

Under patrol lantern, diction compresses to single metallic verbs—file, score, tuck—rhythm as precise as the cog itself.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistently modulated, tightening psychic distance around Mrs. Kaelin’s haptic perceptions and loosening to admit choral overtones. Syntax alternates between long inhalative sentences and clipped fragments that mimic rests: “Then he sang one note, middle C, without armor or anger.” Perceptual signature is acutely sonic—light is “caught,” drapes “absorb,” silence is “traveled”—anchoring POV in the aural profession. No head-hopping; student voices remain external. The elevated but music-specific lexicon is justified by the teacher’s vocation and never drifts into corporate register.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person stays close to Mara’s tongue and retinas; diction of “chlorophyll ghost” and “synaptic rebirth” belongs to a chef-neuroscience hybrid mind. Rhythm accelerates with short pulse clauses during alignment peak, then exhales into bench-sitting vigil. No head-hopping; celestial vibration is felt through her marrow filter. Voice sustains authority without veering into textbook plasticity jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual filter—“too heavy for empty, too light for anything ordinary”—delivering sensory paradox rather than abstract adjectives. Rhythm accelerates up the spiral stairs via clipped clauses, then exhales in the long final sentence that mirrors the honeyed cascade. No head-hopping; child’s voice arrives as external sound, not interiority. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon, edging lyrical only when wonder peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers at the exact distance of “creeping,” never entering heads beyond what a vigilant stroller could infer. Syntax repeats the ritual cadence of “He placed… He walked…”—a litany that teaches its pattern by the third beat and pays off in the oak scene. Diction stays within the noticer’s modest lexicon; “hushed blaze” is the single coined oxymoron, earned because it names the newly real. No filter-verb stacks, no head-hop, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lapidary and aqueous simultaneously: clauses slide like silt, yet diction stays chiseled (“incisively kind,” “crushing clarity”). Rhythm accelerates with Petra’s quickening heart, then slows to geologic time for the decades-long breath. Perceptual signature filters every image through stone bias—temperature, pressure, fracture—without head-hopping. Non-standard punctuation (em-dashes, fragmented lists) is consistent with telepathic cascade, taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s perceptual bias: moonlight “spills,” ink “dreams,” smog “chokes.” Sentence rhythm lengthens during brush stroke, contracts at dawn fade, mirroring insomnia’s ebb. No head-hopping; Mira’s interiority is implied through action only. Diction remains within painterly lexicon; occasional flourish (“moon-singers”) is pattern-taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“slate sky,” “iron ribs,” “velvet pouch”) is character-specific, not generic. Rhythm modulates: long tide-exhale sentences build anticipation, then staccato clauses at the spin heighten pressure. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physically coherent. Kelp-beard is the lone stylized excess, but voice overall is controlled and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax tightens under stress—“She raised the clasp high, and its pearl erupted”—mirroring urgency. Advisor’s riddles carry distinct diction without invading Mira’s interior. No head-hopping; voice modulation purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences conduct their own fractal rhythm: lengthen then fracture in sync with wave propagation; diction stays salt-grit, never academic. Perceptual signature—cloud edges as notation, bronze circles as notation—is specific, sustained, bias-true. No dialogue, so voice purity stands uncontaminated. Filter verbs minimal; compressed kelp/bone noun strings heighten immediacy without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is crystalline, compressed, slightly salt-tinged—“a note that tasted of salt and forgotten language.” Perceptual signature never drifts: Kael notices calcium swirls the way a sailor notices wind. Rhythm accelerates across the single long paragraph, mirroring her climb. One micro-slippage: “quietly driven” is repeated verbatim from prompt; the phrase already lives in her gesture, so the label feels redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Emlyn; perceptual signature is academic-noticing (“mirrored a forgotten testimony”) without slipping into lecture. Rhythm is steady, but compressed phrasing under pressure is absent since pressure itself is absent; voice is coherent yet not distinctive enough for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays lashed to Elias’s surveyor diction—precise spatial verbs, mineral nouns, no lyric overflow. Rhythm modulates: short hammer-blow sentences during stone lifting, longer silt-cloud clauses when memory billows. Perceptual signature clear—he measures first, feels second. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice confident, modest, salt-stained.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person tight to Mira’s indexer gaze: perceptual signature is selective—watermarks, sigils, paper fibers—never tourist-catalog. Lyric compression (“silence around her was a dappled resolve”) is patterned early and paid off in the final image; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Compressed lyric cadence taught from line 1 (“observatory drifted…”) and sustained; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—quantum-imprint, microvolt grief—remains character-specific. Diction skews scientific-poetic but stays within Kael’s technician-grief lexicon. No dialogue, so voice judged on interior; occasional over-cranked metaphor (“galaxy of unspent futures”) is earned by pattern. Rhythm modulates with breaker countdown, tightening breath.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—rotor hum, star-glyph flicker, copper air. Syntax lengthens and contracts with action beats; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to sensory filter; diction (“sieved hush,” “manufactured false memories”) is patterned and repayed at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for brooding, fragments for discoveries. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors organic to narrator’s metal-and-wood workspace.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s sensory filter; diction is restrained, slightly archaic without pastiche (“gibbons moon,” “furrowed hush”). Rhythm mirrors tide and wind—long sentence, short beat, caesura of mist. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, voice-true. No head-hop, no register drift; even the single epithet “silvery scythe” feels like Kael’s thought, not author flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: maritime diction (“barnacled rock,” “rotten pilings”) and star-navigation metaphors remain in Elias’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for drift, staccato for pole counts—mirroring attention under fog. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are voice-motivated and sparse, never dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter: “delicately robust” diction mirrors his fractured calm. Rhythm accelerates during cavern tremor without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Free indirect clean: “he realized…” tied to present stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-fairy-tale yet disciplined: syntactic parallelism (“moon-cinnamon bark, star-anise pods…”) teaches the spell pattern early and pays it off in the final spiral. diction stays within a mythic register—no corporate drift—and the perceptual signature is biased toward scent and lunar light, never tourist-catalog. Rhythm accelerates into the transformation beat via fragment-lean sentences (“skin prickling as fur threaded through”) then exhales into longer cadence for the lullaby, mirroring heartbeat shift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined, wielding long vowel-rich sentences that mirror incantatory ritual without slipping into purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person latched to Kael’s perceptual register: synesthetic (“subsonic thunder”), numerate (“math of coincidence”), humble (“sandals whispered”). Rhythm swells and subsides with volcanic breathing; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within his lexicon; no head-hop. Final sentence achieves Charged Poise through iterative hush/vibration diction, taught on page 1 and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays fused to Seren’s perceptual signature: mechanical numeracy, grease scent, sound of tumblers. No head-hop.

    Third-person limited stays locked to poet; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent—“breath fogging glass,” “scars mapped on tongue”—details only he would notice. Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts under timer tick, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Minor overuse of adjectival halo (“silver halo,” “storm-kissed wonder”) but patterned enough to read as intentional lyric accumulo.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person narration maintains a consistent philosophical-lyric register—long rhythmic sentences, metallic imagery, controlled Latinate diction fitting a “dueling philosopher.” Perceptual signature is sharp: mechanical arm clicks, sundial angles demand decoding, brook provides hush; no head-hop or register drift. Compression is purposeful; only minor filter verbs (“he believed”) appear and are voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays latched to the poet’s perceptual filter—whisper-register, auditory bias, synesthetic silver ribbons—without head-hop. Syntax elongates under moonlight, compresses during guard approach; diction stays within vagrant-poet lexicon. Cora’s laugh “like breaking glass” is the only dialogue, instantly distinctive. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric floats close to the pianist’s perceptual register—diction is precise yet haunted: “skeletal frame… sang,” “cloud stuff,” “velvet darkness.” Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing, with crescendo sentences leading to fragmentary breaths under peak emotion. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to his fingers, pocket weight, and auditory horizon. The voice is unmistakable—no other narrator would liken silence to “silver threads” or describe compasses as “dancing between north and nowhere”—fulfilling the 9+ distinct-signature test.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is irreducibly Kael’s: scientific diction braided with dream-logic, syntax tightening under pressure (“spectrograph readings spiked, but he didn’t need instruments…”).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Consistent third-person limited focalization through Mara, with perceptual signature favoring tactile quiet (cool bell, muffled steps, rustle of leaves). Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for reflection, clipped beats for action (“The bell would chime three times”). Voice avoids therapy-speak; diction stays grounded (“wizened elder,” “secret knock”). Minor flaw: dialogue is sparse but functional; the teacher’s line feels slightly expository, though forgivable given brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices light, refraction, shadow-play, and breath-rhythms as an artist would.

POV remains tightly focalized; even the forge’s reignition is filtered through Lyra’s sensory lens. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays within her designer-poet lexicon (“harmonic gaps,” “frequency voids”).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is singular, lyrical, and consistent—Lux’s perceptual signature favors light, texture, and secret rhythms (“shadow stitched with light,” “station breathe”).

Syntax modulates under stress—shorter sentences during crawl, lyrical cadence at closure. Voice avoids head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“synthetic heart,” not “bio-mechanical chassis”). Only flaw: “firmly adaptive” reads as label rather than lived trait in one beat, slightly breaking voice modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrically controlled, with a perceptual signature fixated on texture, decay, and acoustic absence (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”). Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter clauses during ascent, flowing cadence in oracle’s chamber. POV remains tightly focalized through the traveler until the oracle’s closing hum, a justified shift that echoes the map’s reach.

Voice modulates subtly: lyrical during observation (“resonant hush”), taut during discovery. No dialogue weakens voice distinction, but prose rhythm varies effectively. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “ambiguously clear,” which leans academic over embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices like an appraiser (“appraising its worth not in dollars but in gravity of confession”). Voice modulates under pressure—longer sentences in drowsy alertness, fragmented urgency during ghost materialization. No head-hopping; single POV maintained.

Distinct perceptual signature: world rendered through touch, sight, memory of sound. No head-hopping; drum maker’s interiority remains opaque, preserving mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices barometric shifts, not faces. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: short clauses during chase, lyrical flow in courtyard. Voice avoids exposition; even reflection (“he recalled the day…”) is cued by present tension. Minor flaw: slight register elevation in phrases like “nurture integrity in solitude,” which borders on diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person POV is flawlessly controlled: diction blends artisanal precision (“fragrance chemist’s blotter petal”) with tactile mysticism (“static electricity prickled my palm”). Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during dosing, lyrical flow in reflection—without losing its distinct perceptual signature (emotion sensed via charge, not feeling). No head-hopping; even the client is filtered through the dealer’s observational lens. Prose rhythm mirrors the grotto’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with a lyrical, maritime-inflected rhythm (“salty night air,” “wave of gratitude”). Perceptual signature aligns with Lena’s broker eye—she scans manifests, notices smudges. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Caleb’s weathered speech contrasts Lena’s precision. However, prose occasionally slips into elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing like “cycles of compassion”) that strains POV modesty, especially near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtered through Kael’s sculptor sensibility—his perception prioritizes texture, light, and form (“black glass woven from water-grass”).

Prose modulates under pressure—sentences shorten at climax (“There, etched where a branch met earth…”). No head-hopping; even the girl’s dialogue feels observed, not omniscient. Pattern-taught elision (time jumps via “days folded into weeks”) pays off in closure cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual signature: an illustrator notices textures, light, biological detail (“phosphorescent algae,” “vines of reverberation”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for dreamlike flow, staccato phrasing during the Gasp (“world stuttered… stepped out of the flow”). No head-hopping; prose reflects her artistic mind (“sketched by moonlight,” “pages revealing dreams made visible”).

The prose sings without overwriting; even dense metaphors (“scars traced her forearms, silver lines where fire had written its story”) feel earned and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Kael’s “realistically imaginative” perception—every description bears her luminous, skeptical imprint (“stone basins choked with moss and silence”). Voice modulates rhythmically: long, flowing sentences for patience; short beats for the latch’s whisper. Syntax mirrors her state—measured cadence early, breathless urgency at the fountain. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays within her poetic-but-grounded lexicon. The prose itself embodies “sidereal patience,” earning its lyricism through consistent perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices spectral descent, binary pulses, and emotional hues invisible to telescopes. Voice modulates with pressure—lyric density peaks during revelation (“garden was a Turing machine”), then softens into lullaby cadence. Syntax mirrors recursion: repeated phrases (“petals fell, and fell”) evolve meaning rather than looping. No head-hopping; diction stays within her otherworldly lexicon (“quantum loam,” “sonar pinging”) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)

    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices time in arcs, silence in ticks, ethics in spacing of carved letters. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, staccato fragments during discovery (“First… Second… Third…”). Prose-as-character: syntax mirrors pendular motion (balance, suspension, release). No head-hopping; all knowledge stays bound to her calloused skin and winder’s discipline. Elision is purposeful: Marten’s backstory emerges only through inscriptions, teaching the reader to read silence as confession.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and steeped in tactile melancholy. Syntax varies effectively, with short clauses (“He opened it.”) punctuating longer, flowing descriptions. POV remains tightly focalized; perception is biased toward texture, color, and quietude. No dialogue simplifies control, but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction (“uncharted echoes,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) that borders on conceptual abstraction. Still, perceptual signature—attuned to frayed edges and silver ribbons—holds consistently under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose has a distinct cartographic lyricism: syntax varies rhythmically (short clauses for tension, flowing sentences for modeling), and diction stays within Kaelen’s plausible lexicon (“thermal expansion coefficients,” “pattern stones”). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices freeze-thaw cycles, bird migrations, tremors—not tourist details. No head-hopping; even council scenes stay anchored in her focalization. Voice modulates under pressure: quill “trembles” as stakes peak, yet remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrically precise, with a perceptual signature fixated on light, dust, and sound. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter phrases during transcription (“She worked beneath a heavy wool cloak”), flowing cadence in reflection. POV is stable, deeply interior without head-hopping.

Elevated diction (“synaptic plasticity,” “resonant reconfiguration”) risks register drift but is justified by her synesthetic cognition, making it voice-motivated rather than intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices charge, texture, weight (“too heavy for empty, too light for anything ordinary”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer descriptive sentences pre-blackout, fragmented urgency during ascent (“Her boots scraping rust”). Voice remains consistent first-person limited; no head-hopping. Match-flame prose (“burning bright on the lacquer box’s base”) merges external action with internal revelation without filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—a perceptual signature fixated on hush, breath, and amber light. Syntax modulates with rhythm: short clauses for placement acts, flowing cadences for reflection. No head-hopping; single POV holds.

The prose itself enacts the theme: each sentence a brushstroke of deliberate hope.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to historical residue (“cracked frescoes,” “rust of ancient daggers”). Syntax modulates effectively: longer, flowing sentences for atmosphere give way to taut phrasing at the climax (“drop by fragile drop”). POV remains tightly focalized through Liora; no head-hopping or omniscience. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains consistent diction—elevated but never academic—rooted in her cultured sensibility. Minor deduction for slight uniformity in sentence openings during descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through mechanical and tidal rhythms (“counter-clockwise dance of balance and tension”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short, sharp clauses during the spin (“she spun the yoyo’s string counter-clockwise”) contrast with flowing descriptions of decay. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping despite dual characters, and the keeper’s dialogue (“beard of kelp”) carries idiosyncratic texture.
