    Voice is distinct and craft-anchored ("coaxes light into bottles," "melted sand until it ran, bright and obedient"), maintaining lyric register and perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's certainty matches plausible inference. Minor lapses: "drifting resonance" recurs as a motif-phrase without clear evolution, and some constructions ("the very shape of a conversation that ended in violence") feel slightly over-wrought. Dialogue is minimal (children, councilman) but functional. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays stable on Orren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—he reads emotion as warmth, rhythm as survival memory. Diction is controlled and lyric ("winterglass," "frost flowers blooming between glass layers") without register clash. The phrase "silently expressive" recurs as both attribute and rhythm, bordering on template but serving the motif. Minor artifact: "the system had a flaw, Mara told him" shifts briefly to summary when the slate-writing could have been shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single first-person POV is stable and apt; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is profession-specific: Marek notices cemetery ledgers, catalog cards, coffin coordinates, and undertaker's burial linen before ambient detail. Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon—"weary undertaker," "inadvertently stubborn," "chased stillness"—while reaching for poetic compression ("kelp has knitted a curtain," "city is folding its last secrets"). Psychic distance narrows under stress: at peak pressure (bleeding ears, seam whispers), sentences compress without losing interiority. One minor register drift: "stone arches lean like drowned ribs" and "impossible spaces" edge toward elevated metaphor, but the sustained voice anchors them as Marek's occupational lens transforming surreal architecture into anatomical terms. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Amira's focalization with consistent psychic distance and a perceptual signature shaped by vigilance (listening to sirens, counting by touch, meeting the officer with "hands empty, bell visible"). Diction stays within her lexicon; "amplified quiet she had mastered" and "dignity another rationed item" carry voice-specific compression. The single line of brief dialogue—Amira's declaration to the officer—is purposeful and advances plot. Two deductions: Sami's question ("why the donors could not be thanked openly") carries "the sharpness of youth, loud even when whispered," a filter that tells affect rather than showing vocal register, and the phrase "authority of older faiths" briefly elevates diction beyond Amira's established voice at a key pivot. Otherwise, filter verbs are sparse and voice remains stable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature (salt/compassion taste, chest-as-letter, embers-in-ribs) is distinct and figuratively dense. The pilgrim's dialogue ("revealing through breathing changes") carries modest exposition but reads voice-consistent. No head-hopping. One penalty: elevated diction ("spiritually curious mind," "foggy lucidity," "unused love... trapped as a tight knot") occasionally drifts above natural interiority, edging toward thematic annotation rather than lived thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable first-person with perceptual signature rooted in design vocabulary ("curves that folded back on themselves," "hyperbolic geometry," "finite deck could hold an endless drift"). Diction stays voice-consistent even under peak stress: "syrupy" air, "gentle vertigo that shook my teeth," "bark" metaphor. Lio's two brief speech acts ("whispered," names "without sound") carry goal-driven subtext (warning, trapped knowing). One brief elision—how the protagonist learned hyperbolic math—does not harm causality and keeps momentum high. Rhythm modulates purposefully: longer complex sentences during investigation, shorter fragments at the center turn.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric texture: "dust rises like a curtain," "moves as quietly as falling ash," "thunder learning its name." Perceptual signature is consistent—tactical, image-weighted, compression-charged. Minor dip: "her staggering grace becomes a plan for everyone" in the final line shifts briefly toward external observer certainty, a small distance wobble. Dialogue absent; not required. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; her synesthetic perceptual signature (hearing colors, tasting blue/red in recordings) is consistent and voice-particular. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: lush, patterned sentences during craft sequences tighten when Rell speaks and the device activates. Rell's dialogue "bad luck" vs. Mara's request for "no hero stories" carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor issues: "yellowish sweetness" and "yellow sheen" are slightly label-dependent, and free-indirect occasionally drifts toward summary ("she realized the impact of memories...") rather than staying in Mara's embodied register under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Lio's perception throughout. However, distance control wavers: phrases like "luminous disbelief" and "thin threads of choice" drift into an elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular, especially under pressure. The reader character's ease with the flower code is told ("you read it with the ease of someone who had been taught") but their interiority and distinct voice never materialize. Psychic distance fluctuates without purpose; the final beat's "strange mercy" and "luminous disbelief" repeat cadences from the opening rather than modulating with emotional intensity. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close, with diction filtered through Mara's glassblower sensibility: "molten silica," "salvaged aluminum," "faint seam." Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture, breakage, and transparency. The theatrical narration ("Behold, I remove the tarp") carries distinct idiom and reveals character under pressure. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the final beat when she stops performing and the quiet becomes legible. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent throughout. Minor penalty: "thoughtfully spirited" in the narrator's voice reads slightly external and label-like rather than fully embodied in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV, first-person narration maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: adaptive training, fear-driven selectivity, "salt voice," "erasers." Diction stays character-particular ("Moths skated through moonlight like shredded film"). The boy's dialogue—"Vaughn had broken his arm…wiped them so no adult could read"—carries goal and subtext efficiently. Minor register drift: "the betrayal became transformative in that moment" and "authored" at closure edge toward elevated abstraction outside Mara's established idiom. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (charcoal rubbing, soundstage confrontation).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person; distance modulates appropriately (close during booklet loss, wider during Lyr's instruction). Perceptual signature is distinct: "aftertaste of thunder," "marbled hush under every gust," "ambered hush she guarded." Diction is lyric and controlled, with purposeful compression ("pauses between waves," "resin seals a dead insect") that supports the accumulative design. However, some phrases trend ornamental ("flaking gold leaf booklet, stolen from the palace library and already shedding glitter into my pockets") without altering present choice, and the narrator's lexicon occasionally drifts elevated without dramatic tension to justify the register.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on J-17 throughout; distance is controlled (narrative certainty matches robot sensor logic) and perceptual signature is consistent—custodial filter (salt cart, broom bristles, inventory questions) mixed with emergent philosophical curiosity. Diction balances the mechanical ("grippers," "processors," "maintenance schedule") with the lyric ("dust motes in sunlight," "thin line of light") in ways that feel voice-motivated rather than ornamental, reflecting J-17's dual nature. No head-hopping; the piece respects what J-17 can know and see. Slight register drift at "amalgamate" introduction reads initially academic but is promptly reanchored in J-17's process metaphor ("like swept leaves"), keeping it within plausible robot interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is consistent: sensory specificity ("the stones whisper, a sound so soft it seemed borrowed from breath") and perceptual bias (Mara's archival lens) remain character-particular throughout. Minor slips: several run-on sentences in the opening and middle compress causal links in ways that require re-reading ("she did it because mistrust had frozen the building, not in policy but in the way..."), and the phrase "letting the overhead light pass through it so his reflection broke into two ghostly images" borders on constructed symbolism rather than naturalistic perception under pressure. Distance control is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "saved string, reused nails," "polished them with a scrap of chamois," "wisely pragmatic" reflects Elias's lexicon throughout. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Mera's brief dialogue ("what he expected from glass and chalk") contrasts with Elias's more embedded syntax. Some filter verbs ("told Mera," "asked what") are acceptable within voice but cluster in the final third. Under peak stress (the confession), diction compresses appropriately without losing the narrator's horticultural particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV is stable throughout; psychic distance remains close to Mara's perceptual signature (mechanic's attention to grease, bolts, magnetic tug). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression ("a lung holding its breath," "geometry drawn through holographic principles"). Sen's dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Mara's internal voice balances technical specificity with lyric rhythm. No head-hopping, and the final beat's reflective turn remains anchored in Mara's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Lena's musician attention (lantern light "fluttered like a nervous bow stroke," set pieces "leaned like wrecked ships"). Perceptual signature is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Diction occasionally elevates ("in between space," "ghost of Maestro Varga") but remains voice-motivated and legible. The piece carries purposeful compression (ellipsis between moves, the final gathering told briefly) that fits the Accumulative lens and does not obscure causality. No dialogue appears; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision laced with lyric metaphor (anemometer "returned…into my own ribs," truth "lodged behind my tongue"). Diction remains internally consistent—technical weather vocabulary blends with poetic register without jarring. Mara's speech ("truths behave like pressure systems") mirrors the narrator's idiom, acceptable within the station's shared professional context and the narrator's mediated recollection. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during fever-break and confession, slightly distanced when summarizing Mara's methods. One minor slip: "peripherally aware" is named rather than fully dramatized in every instance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: the narrator's idiom ("eyelids click," "appraise mysteries," "snort") and perceptual signature (filtering events through salvage-lot logic and radio subtext) remain stable under pressure. POV distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The drowsy-alert texture modulates naturally with rising tension. One minor slip: "the truth hit with physical heft" tells emotional impact rather than showing it through embodied perception or micro-choice, slightly dulling immediacy in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (reality as reeds bending, grief composted into soil). Psychic distance remains stable in first person. The dialogue with the other keeper reads functional but lacks subtext or character distinction—both speakers share the same elevated, philosophical register. Under peak pressure (the refuge encounter), diction does not compress or modulate, maintaining uniform texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with lyric compression ("scrubby juniper clung to stone," "thin thread at first, then steadier") that matches Liora's professional lens. POV remains stable in third-limited with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—phrasings like "quietly practical" and "cautiously exuberance" read more like editorial summary than character-specific noticing. Filter verbs ("found the girl's silence softly adaptive") are acceptable but stack in early exposition, mildly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single POV held throughout with stable psychic distance. Voice is distinct and controlled: "bronze quiet," "displaced axis," "dreams tried to stitch an old map onto a world that was slipping its bearings." Diction remains within Lysa's historian idiom without register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—she listens, feels vibrations as sentences, reads walls. No dialogue to judge. Minor stiffness in a few constructions ("their dreams tried to stitch") but rhythm modulates appropriately with the accumulating discoveries and never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lian with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "the universe kept checking her spelling," "swept the water," and the professional bias toward phrasing and text. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional register drift toward academic phrasing ("orchestrate the rest simply by directing flow") slightly exceeds Lian's established idiom. The dialogue between Lian and the courier ("why it said, 'You will leave by the west steps after the second flash,' when there were no west steps on the map") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through subtext (the fortune as both warning and instruction). Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person close to Selo maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (silence as ornament, rhetorical devices as tools). The prose leans into elevated, almost liturgical diction ("metonymy," "anaphora," "chiasmus") that fits the priest's POV but risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy. Mara's interiority is filtered through Selo's observation, which keeps her opaque until the memory surfaces—acceptable but limiting. The parasite's voice is "thin as graphite," a precise image, yet direct dialogue is absent, replaced by narrated rhetorical moves that sometimes read more like craft lecture than lived scene.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinctive, lyric, and controlled: "upturned hush," "time had found a seam," "a whole orchestra implied in pressure changes." Diction remains within the protagonist's introspective register throughout, and purposeful compression ("doubled horizon," "chronologically homesick") is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. The perceptual signature—filtering setting through memory-mapping and sound metaphors—is consistent and character-specific, and the prose rhythm modulates naturally with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric cadence ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") that matches Lysa's gravity-defying trade and reflective nature. Psychic distance is consistent. However, filter phrases ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") cluster in key beats and dull immediacy slightly. The perceptual signature—noticing water beads, tile splits, rune pulses—is character-specific and holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV third-limited with clean focalization through Mara's deafness: she "read[s] music in faces and floors," feels "thread of stillness," and perceives "heat in her ribs" rather than sound. Perceptual signature is character-specific and controlled under pressure. Diction ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush," "startled mice") is purposeful and voice-consistent. No head-hopping. The final line's meta-commentary ("carrying with her a new lesson") edges toward summary but remains anchored in the pocketed needle and imagined classroom. Free indirect thought is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the needle-scoring, wider at the twilight exit). Sentence rhythm varies naturally without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable first-person; psychic distance is controlled and the narrator's perceptual signature—storm-recorder habits, reading "wind shifts" and "people"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches the protagonist's methodical, observational idiom. No dialogue on the page; Mara's whispered exposition is brief and functional. One friction: a few constructions edge toward elevated register ("cadence of their steps," "tranquility that tried to pass as safety") that, while legible, occasionally drift from the grounded voice established in the opening. Compression under stress is appropriate and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first person with a highly specific perceptual signature: "roadside poet," "passionate but subtle," prose rhythm modulates from lyric compression ("highways hummed like tuning forks") to longer contemplative cadences that fit the narrator's reflective stance. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's way of noticing is consistently filtered through poetic metaphor and ethical framing. Free indirect reflection is clean. One minor register slip: "passionate but subtle" and "ethically playful" feel slightly like authorial description rather than lived interior idiom, but they're brief and don't disrupt the voice's overall coherence. No dialogue to evaluate. Diction stays within the narrator's plausible literary/observational lexicon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through Mara's acoustic perception ("private thunder only she can notice," "faintest tremors of sound"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("chronic hush," "ash-stained palms," "beauty hides"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate at the cistern, then pulls back to the harbor walk. Jory's silence and Mara's plain-word storytelling carry distinct texture. No head-hopping or filter stacks. Syntax varies under pressure ("she changes pitch, circling the knot until it loosens").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—professional appraisal vocabulary ("distilled smiles," "rehearsed grief," "sugary notes"), static-electricity metaphors, and the affectionate-detachment stance filter every line. Dialogue (one brief exchange: "Tell me what you remember") feels natural and advances the appraisal. Minor register drift: "fuse insight with empathy" and "absurdly for a woman who sold fakes" edge toward essayistic phrasing that slightly breaks the tactile immediacy elsewhere sustained. The final paragraph modulates distance effectively, tightening on Mira's internal shift without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is present: "eyes, whimsically attentive even in crowds," "negotiated shipping schedules by reading tiny discrepancies." Diction is purposeful and clean, though occasional phrases lean ornamental ("promenade breathed salt and music"). Dialogue carries subtext and purpose in Eli's embarrassment and Mara's question about making work visible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Sava's perception. Voice is distinct—lyric compression, elevated diction ("luminescent ache," "wound trying to heal")—but register occasionally drifts into poetic ornament that slows momentum ("Beyond the murmur of lost languages" reads atmospheric yet vague). Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("she asked to be taught who belonged to whom"), carrying subtext in the council's surprise. Free indirect style is clean. Perceptual signature is evident in Sava's attention to reeds, spirals, and lattice-making. Under peak stress (arbor discovery, final dedication), diction remains elevated without collapse, though the prose never varies cadence to reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Rin's perceptual signature: she notices repeating shapes, measures errands by the Giant's chest, sketches "not for beauty but to mark repeating shapes." Orren's dialogue ("This will hold what you borrow, but it will also remember what you owe") carries natural cadence and subtext, though the boatmen and echo-figure remain voiceless. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("layered and luminous, like a flock of birds turning at once"), though some phrases tip toward elevated register ("the place where echoes are born," "a child-sized figure made of reverberation") that slightly strain naturalism under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Lysa's perceptual signature: she notices rhythms, coordinates, patterns, and emotional equations. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dovetail," "bruise," "theorem," "axiom") with vocabulary fitting a secretive conjurer's worldview. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the seam-opening, slightly pulled back for the final reflection. Minor weakness: one phrase ("a door neither shut nor open") edges toward generic metaphor, and "tenderly furious" risks oxymoron without full embodiment. No head-hopping; interior access remains consistent. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lio navigates by touch and smell, and his way of noticing is specific to his hidden life. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the character's lexicon—"ferromagnetic," "sapphire hush," "Resonant Reconfiguration" feel authorial rather than Lio's—but remains mostly legible and voice-motivated. The child's whispered "Thank you" and the librarian's murmur about a "good ghost" are natural and advance the moment. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the child's arrival and the final fragment-to-cheek beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual signature consistent: "circuitously sincere," notices "how roots angled toward runoff," feels "each potted fern breathe." Diction remains character-specific ("reluctantly, like bark taking rain") and modulates under pressure (short bursts during metamorphosis, longer cadence at closure). The boy's brief dialogue feels natural and advances plot (Mara's roundabout explanation about listening). Minor: "transforming her into a better witness" in the penultimate sentence edges toward summary, though it's concretely anchored in the prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and apt throughout; first-person narration maintains consistent access and filters all detail through the narrator's painter's eye and exhausted, porous state. Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator notices "washed-out coastlines," "rain trails," "dark seams through sand and shell," all in service of artistic observation and the wry-earnest tone. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "haggard awe," "thresh meaning from experience," "porous for disbelief." Mara's brief dialogue carries subtext and purpose. Minor slip: one phrase—"memory rose like bubbles"—feels slightly elevated for the established idiom but remains within range. No head-hopping; internal thought formatting is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Sera with brief dips to Lan's interior at the climax. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("bright darkness," "cathedral of prisms," "laughter swallowed in midnight") consistent with the tone. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("methodical and hungry," "steadily unpredictable truth") that feels more thematic than embodied. The force's dialogue ("wishes were merely doors") reads as thesis rather than character-specific speech, and Sera's sudden ability to sing the exact right verses feels convenient rather than voice-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Mara's perceptual signature (charting what was missing, seeing gaps as reefs, adjusting her map of losses on the spot) is consistent and character-specific. The phrase "reactively visionary, not by prophecy, but because each new shard of story sparked a fresh pattern in her mind" maintains voice-motivated register. Purposeful compression (summarizing the three evenings, Sorrel's three visits) serves accumulative design. Minor deduction for two moments where diction elevates slightly beyond immediate embodiment: "navigated absences, the art of charting what was missing" reads slightly expository in the opening, and "meaning assembled slowly, through staggered intervals of listening, revisiting, and letting grief settle between questions" tilts abstract when anchored only to the council's erasures. Both remain voice-plausible but test the upper limit of psychic distance during scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third; psychic distance and perceptual signature (mapper's eye, measuring calipers, hairline seams) are consistent. Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("fortress of unspoken truths," "coherent riddle") that feels imposed rather than character-voiced during peak beats. The conductor's line ("Fortress of unspoken truths, one stop, no returns") reads slightly formal for spoken dialogue but carries subtext. Filter verbs ("she suspected," "she understood") appear but do not dull immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature—"sympathetic skeptic"—shapes selective attention (polished instruments, grid numbers, "knot tug inside her"). Diction matches her educated, skeptical stance. Leena's whispered line carries subtext without exposition. Minor filter-verb stack in the middle passage ("she saw," "she understood," "she realized") slightly dulls immediacy during a high-pressure sequence but does not collapse voice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Ilias; perceptual signature is distinct (dimensionally aware, translating invisible lines, feeling space twitch). Diction matches the immortal's weary register: "intrigue was the only emotion he could still manufacture," "goodbye had never been real for him while he stayed." Maris's dialogue ("don't provoke them") carries natural rhythm and subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens at the threshold crossing. Minor convergence: "hushed thunder" and "ozone and old letters" risk elevated diction but remain within the speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "a con artist's honest child" establishes idiom, and Mara's perceptual signature (ledgers, equations, symmetry) remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional—Ivo's rehearsed charm, Sami's soft proof, Mara's direct questions. Minor slips: "the way any rule book softened after a line was written with it" feels slightly expository, and some metaphors ("pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence") drift toward elevated register during high pressure. Free indirect style is clean; the prose reflects Mara's calculation-minded lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable psychic distance throughout; focalization anchors in Haru's perceptual signature (stationer's attention to paste, cedar, gold, grid-notes, textures). Diction remains within his lexical range—"earnestly studious," "refract," "incandescent restraint"—without register drift. The prose modulates purposefully: compressed early beats ("no one remains to read it") expand in the garden to richer sensory layering. One elision (how he charts the hum mechanically) is slight and does not obscure method or choice. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or voice convergence. The narrative certainty matches what Haru can know; invented histories are framed as reconstructions, not omniscient fact.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person voice is distinct and sustained: synesthetic perception (burlap, wet silk, dry sand, citrus sting), aversion to paper, preference for layered memory. Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (filtering sound as touch, craving texture) remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiom—poetic but grounded in port labor and sensory specificity. The prose modulates appropriately: calm accumulation during the week of listening, brief compression at the Container 9H discovery, expansive lyricism in the final whisper-and-walk. No dialogue on the page; overheard fragments are reported, not dramatized, which is voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli's perceptual signature is consistent and appealing—"gloomy cheerfulness," whistling in gloom, "cheerful as a lantern in drizzle"—and his idiom remains stable under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and the single-POV frame holds. However, "He did not solve the world like a puzzle, but he decoded his part in it" tilts toward meta-commentary, and some phrasing ("Every superstition was a crooked map toward something true") skirts thesis-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close access to Ira's orderly-intuitive perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "desperation sharpened her hope into a plan she could not delay" and "heard the new engines like teeth" show character-specific filtering. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under peak pressure. However, the opening ~180 words hover in an expository register ("That gift mattered now, because the Council had posted...") that delays immersion, and Vell's interior claim at the bridge-confrontation ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum") briefly leaks into his head without full focalization shift. Perceptual signature is strong in carnival-specific idiom (bunting, ferris wheel, mask-makers).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "curiosity like a tool, sharpened on purpose," "reactions, unlike people, keep their promises if you respect their conditions," "the coming sunrise feel like a farewell letter." Psychic distance is stable; Mara's perceptual signature is selective (she notices the slow fall of sand, the smear of the Milky Way, the birds' hesitation). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Eli's "Keep it" carries weight, and Mara's explanation about chemistry trusting conditions reveals character. Minor: one phrase edges toward over-figuration ("the sky belongs to itself") but remains voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("thought," "asked") are acceptably sparse. Diction stays within Mara's plausible register (engineer-adjacent, poetic but grounded). The narrative stance modulates with the approaching dawn without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Lio with stable distance; his perceptual signature (listening, warmth on skin, angles inferred from refraction) is consistent and voice-specific. The prose modulates subtly—calm and methodical during repair, slightly urgent as the harbor horn booms—without breaking texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Lio's "That is how I oversee" and his final instruction to Sera carry subtext (trust in indirect perception). One minor slip: "the depot trembled with distant cheers" and "the depot's glass roof shivered" repeat the same device (building personification) within a short span, a small rhythmic echo that doesn't materially harm but prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Riven's voice is controlled and perceptually signature: "dry wit for armor," "tasting the implication," "water always tells on itself." Psychic distance stays consistent; no head-hopping. The phrase "subtly confident" and "tranquil worry" are embedded in action rather than asserted. Diction remains stable under pressure—"quiet verdict," "singular convergence settle into certainty"—and the phrasebook question spoken aloud lands as a decisive act rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Sava; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent—elevated, patient, tuned to sound—and perceptual signature is clear (Sava hears confession in a tuning fork, treats footsteps as metronomes). Dialogue is sparse and functional: Mara's question and Sava's riddle answer establish his cryptic nature. Minor drift: "infinitely patient" and "cryptic" are told labels rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Diction remains stable, though phrases like "basalt that swallowed sound" and "ebony tuning fork...black as drowned wood" edge toward decorative doubling without narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, third-person limited, distance stable. Perceptual signature is selective and apt: Mara notices the vial's warmth, the hush as "stored stillness," and mosaic flashes as memories. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("lonesome splendor," "unanswered prayers," "gathered hush"). No dialogue; all pressure is interior and sensory. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress ("panic rose again, but she overrode instinct"). Minor slips: "the gathered hush deepened, sealing her beacon" uses passive phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy, and the phrase "ancient technology for storing the fleeting things humans squander" edges toward essayistic register for a beat. Overall, voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single first-person POV maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature throughout. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and character-specific: he tracks sound through lattice holes, reads scuffs as maps, interprets the beam's "polite" avoidance. Diction stays within the focalizer's plausible lexicon—lyric but grounded, with phrases like "copperlight repose" and "hush spoke back" feeling voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The compression in "folded like paper inside the Fresnel lens" and "illumination itself could avert its gaze" reflects the narrator's particular way of seeing impossibility. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the lantern-room discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Eli with a consistent lyric-alchemical register ("distilled moonlight into sap," "lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo appearance"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching the alchemist-narrator tone. The bride's single line of dialogue—"Eli, you still carry my bead"—feels natural and goal-driven, and her later "You owe me" and "Repay me" carry subtext of both tenderness and demand. Minor slips: "ephemeral cameo appearance" and "ashen-veil ghost bride" read as author-label intrusions rather than Eli's idiom, momentarily breaking the established voice. Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors, attention to resonance and frequency) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: "pale petals give the night an orchid solace," "sweet, bruised perfume." Diction remains elevated throughout without jarring register shifts. Distance is stable third-limited on Ila. However, perceptual filtering is thin—Ila's way of noticing reads generically poetic rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. The elevated register occasionally drifts toward ornament ("haunting optimism," "bruised perfume") without tactical purpose, and the final paragraph's phrasing flirts with theme-echo, limiting upward reach.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora's "warmly curious habit," her treatment of bones with "gentle apologies," her filtering of detail through excavation method. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the tremor, slightly distant during setup). Diction remains stable and apt ("cautious enchantment," "purposeful wandering"). Minor issues: a few filter verbs ("seemed to listen," "felt too familiar") dull immediacy, and one phrase—"cautious enchantment in the simple proof"—reads slightly elevated for the moment's pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (grandmother's tune, father's lunch pail, ebony clipboard as ceremonial object) and the register blends procedural precision with lyric compression. Non-standard syntax (long, accretive sentences) is taught early and serves the accumulative texture. The courier's brief presence is handled without head-hopping, and the final shift to commuters entering the arcade anchors the closing image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Liora notices thread, light, signal patterns). Dialogue between Liora and Kest carries subtext and code ("Do the stars still giggle at you?") and advances plot efficiently. Voice is distinct with elevated diction ("adjacent possibilities," "echoed silence") that fits the setting and narrator. One friction: the prose occasionally tilts toward exposition ("to prove it, they had to synchronize…") that tells rather than dramatizes, flattening urgency mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person close on Mara with a lyric, elevated register ("a state of courage," "the smallest mercy"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices the shard, the spirits' song, the condensation script—but diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("the exact hinge of time," "a state of paper but a state of courage") that sits above her embodied stress. No dialogue appears on the page despite the brother's arrival and the apology being "spoken," which robs the closure of specificity. The repeated phrase "fierce tenderness" functions as a tonal anchor but also as a label rather than enacted subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Lani's perceptual signature (noticing ink swells from tears, recognizing fear patterns) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and idiomatic ("lotus hearted ache," "unknotting," "bleached stone"). The prose modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Minor: a few filter phrases ("she realized," "she felt") appear in high-density passages where free indirect style could have sharpened immediacy, and the final dialogue slightly over-articulates the metaphor rather than trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "fog took on faint shadows, as if the air remembered what had been photographed" and "laughing again at the absurdity of taking instruction from paper insects" carry Mara's particular rhythm and sensibility. Psychic distance remains stable; the daydream frame is established immediately and held without unmotivated slippage. Diction occasionally elevates ("recessive laughter had found its voice") in a way that edges beyond Mara's plausible idiom under pressure, but the effect is minor and does not disrupt coherence. Purposeful compression ("messages arrived as moths of paper") teaches the daydream logic early and pays it off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the awakenings, slightly wider when describing the garden). The perceptual signature—noticing echoes as maps, timing brushstrokes to sound—is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Tomas's question frames the story, and Mara's final reply drives closure. The prose carries distinct texture ("the world tells when it trusts you"), though under peak pressure (the nested loops) some sentences drift toward elevated register ("dolls of attention") that tests the restorer's lexicon. No head-hopping; the elision of Tomas's interiority is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (entomologist's attention to wings, larvae, mesh). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "candor wrapped in riddles," "stood guard over your own spark." Lio's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("How many spots on this ladybug" as code). Minor slips: "charming rogue scholar" is told rather than shown through action, and some figurative phrases ("converging chaos") lean elevated without full integration into the narrator's idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric—"reef-shadow joy," "ensconcing her in a cradle of calcium and tide"—creating a distinct texture that remains consistent under pressure. The narrative voice filters setting and action through Mara's quiet, poet's sensibility. No dialogue on the page; the lullaby and Iren's message are embedded perceptions rather than spoken lines. Psychic distance is controlled, though the high register risks minor ornamental drift in peak beats ("the taste of the air" works; "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" reads slightly precious but remains voice-motivated).

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable and the prose carries a distinct, lyric texture: "opal arches," "vitrified petals," "a kind of foxglove regret blooming in my throat." Perceptual signature is consistent—every detail filtered through the caretaker's archival priorities—and the voice modulates purposefully from cataloging routine to quasi-mystical recognition ("the lamp in my hand flared, as if it recognized the timber of the past"). However, elevated diction ("vitrified," "deserted marvels," "foxglove regret") pervades most sentences without clear pattern-teaching, creating a uniform ornamental register that risks distancing the reader during peak moments. Dialogue is absent; no test applies.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Mara's professional lens ("read dead scripts the way musicians read scores") and her caution. However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("silence drained away like ink in water," "corridor no one wanted to cross") that feels writerly rather than character-particular under stress. The team's dialogue at the climax is reported in Sava rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. The phrase "carefully reckless" is applied twice as a label without embodied syntax that mirrors the trait in her thought patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "river light flicker through reeds," translates dye marks to gate settings, and thinks in terms of "safety factor" and "hydraulic" logic. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Rolen's "voice shaking" distinguishes his urgency from Mara's measured resolve. Minor slip: "dappled resolve" in paragraph 18 reads slightly authorial rather than Mara's idiom, and the phrase "encrypted in every safety factor" in paragraph 20 borders on thesis articulation. Free indirect style remains clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer; psychic distance is controlled and diction ("foxed paper," "mars meteorite chip," "swirl of dust motes") reflects her particular way of noticing. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("mind bloomed and withered at once"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Oren's "softly" and Merek's confession feel slightly generic in rhythm. One minor filter-verb cluster in the skylight scene ("she asked," "he said," "she felt") flattens immediacy under peak pressure, and the phrase "because promises were exactly what she had learned to forge on paper" reads slightly over-articulated for a crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV held cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is purposefully lyric ("featherly determined," "hush fracture," "intervals of waiting"), with a consistent elevated register that matches the conceptual stakes. The perceptual signature—Mira reading grain as time, feeling heat through a wall, sensing patterns in wood rings—is specific and sustained. Psychic distance remains controlled. Two small frictions: "featherly determined" recurs identically twice without variation, and some constructions ("She could not read it directly, but she could intuit") lean toward filter verbs in a way that slightly softens immediacy. Voice is coherent and distinct but not quite seamless under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Mira's perceptual signature ("tapping walls to map hollow spaces," algae as "submerged zodiac") is distinct and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("leaving felt like admitting the city had truly been forgotten"). The register occasionally elevates ("shadowseamed," "softly ingenious") in ways that feel authorial rather than Mira's idiom under stress, and Jonah's voice converges slightly with Mira's lyricism at the dome. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes," "laugh curdle when the crater glass warmed," "cheerfully, because despair likes company." Psychic distance is stable, and POV modesty holds (conjectures are framed as conjectures). Diction remains voice-specific and poetic without slipping into corporate register. Mira's brief dialogue ("used to walk a ridge trail… until one morning the ridge simply stopped") carries subtext (grief, evasion) and advances plot.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Milo with controlled distance and distinct perceptual signature: he "marked her as the hinge," "scanned faces...as if they were variables," thinks in diagonals and probabilities. Diction stays consistent—"calculated wilderness," "variables," "orchestrated serendipity"—reflecting his analytical performer identity. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the night watch's "'All right, numbers man'" and "'let it tell me where you want trouble to happen'" carry subtext and advance plot. The prose modulates appropriately under stress (short, decisive beats during the救援). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with Mira's perceptual signature—tide-dancer idiom, reading gaps, feeling currents—controlling diction and focus. The keeper's mist-voice ("wet stone") and dialogue ("Exile is safest when chosen") feel distinct. Under peak stress (panic, then seated dance), syntax tightens without losing texture: "At first panic flared, then her dancer sense noticed that the anchoring had a rhythm." One recurring pattern: several mid-pressure beats open with "She [verb]" constructions (She sat, She tried, She realized, She rose), creating minor template cadence that doesn't obscure but lacks full rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Ilya's glazier's lens (light, glass, geometry, patterns). The prose has a distinct lyric texture ("the boats were silhouettes," "disciplined colors," "water knew how to speak in geometry") that modulates with the scene's contemplative tone. Filter verbs ("he had learned," "he saw") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. The inspector's internal shift is narrated with certainty that exceeds what Ilya could observe ("whose face had been tight with the urgency of deadlines"), a minor POV leak. Diction stays within Ilya's plausible register, though phrases like "appetite to erase" and "bureaucratic phrasing" briefly drift toward editorial summary. No dialogue distinctness test applies (only one speaker on the page).

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third on Mara with clear psychic distance. The perceptual signature—"the moon glazing its fractures so they looked like small rivers," "the forest began to scream in sap and snapping limbs"—is distinct and sensory. Dialogue between Mara and Jonah feels purposeful and goal-driven, though brief. Register occasionally elevates ("translate pain into a universal language," "a new grammar") in ways that read more literary than character-particular under stress, but the lapses are minor and the voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with Mina's perceptual signature evident in technical diction ("calibration formula," "coefficients," "term for divergence") and methodical observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate during gauge readings and ensemble realization, pulling back for the town gathering and basket ascent. Free indirect style is clean, though a few filter verbs ("she understood the method," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in high-stakes beats. Voice is distinct and consistent, with syntax reflecting Mina's logical-dreamer mindset. The phrase "hope, like lift, could be computed and shared" in the final line risks didacticism but reads as earned synthesis rather than authorial intrusion. No dialogue present; scoring applies narration only.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices sound texture ("overlapping taps," "layered murmurs") and architectural memory before visual detail, consistent with her profession. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("she understood at last that her own job was not to steal the walls' dreams") to wider reflection on Arlen's encoded intentions. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("descendants would need them to endure the changed world") that reads slightly above Liora's tacit voice under stress, and a few filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") cluster in the final third where immediacy would serve better. No head-hopping, and the ending's promise to the corridors maintains voice coherence with a slight compression that fits the moment's solemnity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("panic could not fit inside the odd loan," "emotion was a pigment she refused to waste") that reads purposeful but occasionally drifts into writerly decoration under pressure. Perceptual signature is present: the protagonist notices rainlight, prism colors, coded patterns in the lullaby. However, the diction—"perceptively calm" (used twice identically), "dusky harmony," "as if emotion was a pigment"—leans toward stock poetic phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. Dialogue is minimal (painter's two short lines) and functional. Filter verbs ("I saw," "I heard," "I felt") appear but do not stack heavily. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited on Sera is stable; perceptual signature ("lantern smoke curl," "the terrace tilt as if the sky itself judged her") is character-specific. Diction elevates purposefully ("flawed beauty," "indifferent waltz") and remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Maro's snort, Odran's skeptical question, and the vows advance stakes and reveal status. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" is used as a phrase twice, once in narration and once as near-repetition; while voice-motivated, the echo risks filter-verb stacking in peak beats. No head-hopping; no unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is controlled and distinctive: "white coat flapping like a flag that had forgotten its nation," "chapel," "arithmetic," "unbuyable." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the throat-tightening, wider at the board justification). Perceptual signature is consistent—she counts angles, lets salt cut her soles, hears or imagines wingbeats. One line edges toward thematic echo: "the grace she had broken and the grace she still chose" articulates the premise directly in the final beat, though it remains imagistic enough to avoid full sermon. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Maris; psychic distance is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is consistent ("listened between sigh and smile," "posture and breath speak"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated with purposeful elevation ("bodily poem," "narrow interval where people let truth leak"). No head-hopping. Two slips: "the governor tried to speak, but his rehearsed phrases came out hollow" externalizes his interiority with unearned certainty; and the phrase "alarming serenity" recurs as a label rather than embodied perception in the final line. Filter verbs ("she felt") appear once, voice-motivated. Purposeful compression and lyric cadence are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance; Ilya's perceptual signature (calligrapher's eye for flourish-to-bone, hearing what "ink had been hiding") is character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Mara's "You reversed the story" and her veto request carry subtext and advance the ethical negotiation. The prose modulates from reflective ("silence let him hear") to concrete action (carving, performing) without filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. One minor register drift: "a seedy bars where he performed through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" contains a repetition artifact and awkward phrasing ("through...shows") that momentarily blurs clarity, though voice recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the perceptual signature (Arin notices knots as promises, hears broken radio rhythms, reads valley denial as "interrupted cadence") is character-specific. Diction remains controlled and literary without mid-crisis register drift. The voice break ("not from doubt but from the weight") is purposeful and embodied. Minor slip: "esoteric realist, because he believed omens mattered only when they could be measured" reads slightly expository in the opening, though it anchors character quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the caster's attention to metal, wax, fiber creak, and negative spaces. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("filings in a bell," "an ingot in my chest"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's "I realized" edges toward expository insight, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closing image, but the line recovers with the concrete metaphor of "one carefully illuminated braid at a time." Psychic distance shifts intentionally, modulating with the protagonist's focus on craft and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV with a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("limitation keeps me precisely playful, testing each fork like a joke with a blade hidden in the punchline"). Distance and focalization remain stable. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (dream corridors as "both hallway and river") support the accumulative design. Minor register drift occurs when interiority toggles between embodied ("grit in my teeth") and abstract ("transcend, through the same interpreted dreams"). Filter verbs ("I realize," "I understand") occasionally dull immediacy at peak beats, though the perceptual signature—dreams as interpretive tool—remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Nabu-iddin's perceptual signature: his professional idiom ("gnomon and sighting tube," "schematic representations," "recorded angles") and frugal attention (counting copper nails, reusing tablets, wrapping in discarded linen) create a distinct, voice-specific texture. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the tile mapping, wider during the chamber reveal). No dialogue appears, so voice convergence is not testable. Diction remains within the astronomer's plausible lexicon—no unmotivated register drift—and the prose rhythm tightens at the climax without melodrama. One minor slip: "the unknown were borrowing him to look back" edges toward abstract poeticism rather than character-specific perception, but it remains legible and voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV (Lio) with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "scheming pacifist," "as if grace were sliding from one joint to the next." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("resentments that stayed constant even when their names did not"). No dialogue on the page; gesture and silence carry subtext effectively ("showed his empty hands," "mouthed" the argument). Minor register wobble: "teaching release more effectively than any sermon" and "planned the next gentle theft" tilt toward authorial summary rather than Lio's interior idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, clean focalization throughout. Diction ("shimmer of twilight frost," "bright animal," "pressure behind his eyes") is purposeful and voice-consistent. Psychic distance tightens during the climax ("held his breath...anchoring the moment") without filter clutter. Minor: elevated register ("articulate," "reconfiguration") occasionally drifts from artisan idiom, and a few stock phrases ("bright animal," "second heart") slightly flatten the otherwise distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (grumbling at dust, recognizing "accidental wisdom" in graffiti) is consistent. Dialogue ("vows were for adults and adults broke them first," "Vows should stay where you can see them") pursues goals and carries subtext. Distance control holds except for one phrase: "endearing even to herself" intrudes as light meta-commentary mid-pressure. Filter use is minimal and voice-motivated. Diction stays within Mira's register, and the prose rhythm modulates across beats without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—she notices tags, hears a child's laugh, sees herself as "both child and old woman"—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated, quasi-academic register ("nonlinear inheritance," "philosophical breakthroughs," "accession note") that feels imposed rather than character-particular under pressure. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("accepting that…") flattens voice at the closure beat. Distinct rhythmic control and purposeful compression are evident in the opening and orchard sequences, but the bathroom-epiphany motif is told more than shown, reducing perceptual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Lysa's linguist perspective ("the store's own syntax," "future-tense grammar"). Narrative distance is consistent and voice carries a distinct lyric register ("shelves breathing in chords," "Find what I could not"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Orren's lines ("in his timeline these readers died quietly") advance exposition without strain. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("the act of naming loosened a spell") in ways that flatten urgency, and perceptual signature—while present—does not degrade or sharpen under peak stress. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates smoothly from observation to interiority ("she had learned," "she understood then"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "chimera twin discoverer," "blissfully aberrant curse," "unkindled solace" all feel voice-specific. One register slip: "as though listening for its own name" in "the fog outside thinned with each sentence as though listening for its own name" introduces slight anthropomorphic whimsy inconsistent with the prior cool professional tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices objects (swatch, filaments, mannequin label) and interprets them through her twin-recovery lens. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled throughout; Mara's perceptual signature (methodical, archival framing: "translate confusion into clarity," "sender, recipient, and witness") is distinct and consistent. Diction reflects her professional idiom ("misfiled treaty box," "finding aids," "deliberate merge of categories"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Filter verbs ("she remembered," "she understood") appear occasionally but remain voice-motivated and legible. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately with pressure, and psychic distance tightens during the braiding sequence. One minor slip: "the tower forgot its own shape" reads slightly precious for the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable throughout; Sava's perceptual signature (ripple-marks, harmonic sensitivity) colors all observation. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("hammered repose," "bloom of hush," "braided pale arcs"), though the lexicon occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction that tests the boundary of a mapkeeper's working idiom. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing are legible and serve the accumulative lens. No dialogue appears on the page, so those bullets do not apply. The final paragraph's rhythm supports closure without narrative distance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV with stable first-person distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "thistle-blown hope," "maps were ash and radio towers were bones," objects "carried memories like dust." Psychic distance tightens under pressure (touching chalk marks to see tomorrow's smears, the hush's silence sharpening retrocognitive gift) without filter-verb stacks. The caravan leader's quoted line is filtered through retrocognitive vision, maintaining POV modesty. Diction remains post-collapse lyric throughout with no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "preemptively nostalgic for the lives I had not yet recorded," "shadows lengthen in slow arithmetic." Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("summer-quill archivist," "umbrae," "stormlit"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, compression in peak beats occasionally blurs immediacy—"the hush in the air deepened as if the observatory were drawing a long breath" abstracts rather than embodies the moment. Register remains within the focalizer's idiom throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization holds throughout with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight during discovery of the tile, broader during staging). Jorin's perceptual signature (chant rhythms, filtering by "smell and echo," "ambient awareness") is asserted but inconsistently embodied—e.g., "his chant changed tempo, and his eyes caught on a single blue tile" names the method without showing the sensory filtering at work. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("why a fortress needed secret instructions from a child?") but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Syntactic variety supports rhythm, though some phrases ("serious playfulness was Jorin's trade") edge toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-close on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (warmly observant, noticing Iven's thumb, reading transition periods). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Mara's tangent ("whether he remembered the first pool") is evasion with subtext, and Iven's lines carry fear and shame. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful rhythm modulation ("the pause finally ended, not with surrender but with agreement to try"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the child filters stimuli through compression metaphors ("box in my mind," "scraping" lungs) and taste-synesthesia ("pear," "bitter tea"). Psychic distance is stable first-person, with diction appropriate to a reflective but embodied adolescent voice. The exposure-method modulates rhythm organically—short breaths during panic, expansive syntax in the final line—and no head-hopping occurs. Dialogue is absent but not needed; the father's carpenter-pencil labeling and the monks' warnings arrive through action and object.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (noise meter, storm glass, inherited pedagogy). Diction is elevated and patterned ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical") but voice-motivated as a gondola operator who philosophizes about silence. One dialogue exchange with Mara reads natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. The long sentences and lyric compression are taught early and remain legible. Minor deduction: the phrase "accept movement while deciding what kind of movement it would be" leans abstractly mid-beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: "the hiss of a cassette and the click of a mechanical lock," "like static from a radio tuned between stations." Diction reflects the lore keeper's lexicon (archaic clearance, dynasty, orchard mapped by old records). Some phrases slip into elevated register under no particular stress—"sallied into the night," "the method when she saw the peeling edges"—but remain legible. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she trusted") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue is present to judge. The final line's rhythm ("the story she would tell had finally found its heir") modulates effectively for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; distance is controlled (perceptions filtered through her ritual lens: "darkness could be folded like cloth"). Diction remains voice-consistent—elevated but anchored in tactile metaphor (soot, ash, grain, ridges). Psychic certainty stays modest: Mara realizes it's Lio, she infers his panic through the ring and grain, she does not read his mind. The prose has distinct texture: sentence rhythm modulates (short bursts at the rattling ring, longer cadences in reflection). Minor slip: "breathless shadow shaped like Lio" introduces slight ambiguity—is it metaphor or literal spirit-form?—and the narration does not clarify Mara's interpretation quickly enough. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (door opening, guiding hands) syntax tightens appropriately without voice drift.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice is lyric-dense and consistent ("shadowseam," "slick triangles of paper"), but register drifts into abstraction under pressure: "ache of those parallel selves like pressure she could finally use" and "quantum promise" feel authorial rather than Mara's idiom. Sentence stems repeat: "she kept," "she ran," "she used" across adjacent paragraphs. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Leander's perceptual signature: "eloquently silent way," scholar's idiom, intuition-bridging. Distance modulates purposefully from tight interiority ("intuition made a bridge inside him") to scene action. Register is consistent, though a few phrases risk elevated diction ("the dynasty ender," "the first widow of the dynasty"). No dialogue appears; the gramophone voice substitutes effectively. Rhythmic control under pressure holds, with sentence length compressing slightly during the discovery sequence, though the climax could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature ("equations prayed," "counting that also sings," "shivering bliss") is distinct and voice-driven. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("factually mystical certainty," "chemical reagent," "luminous saplings...applauding in soft, chemical rain") that, while atmospheric, strains the lexicon of a "withdrawn knight." Psychic distance remains controlled, but the narrator's certainty about abstract states ("curve of futures," "shape of possibility") exceeds what the POV can plausibly articulate in the moment withoutFilter or anchoring cue.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Mara's archival attention: "she learned to read what people did not write" establishes perceptual signature. Diction is controlled and rhythmic—"a nickname scratched in pencil, a blot where a tear had fallen"—and carries Mara's voice consistently. Josie's brief dialogue ("why a soldier would write such a thing") is naturalistic and goal-driven. However, two passages drift into elevated summary: "her motive became simple and stubborn, to magnify small kindnesses that might keep the next heart from breaking" and "feeling her grief shift from a weight into a lens" read as authorial restatement rather than Mara's own idiom under pressure. Minor register slips prevent entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and internally consistent ("auric," "nails holding a painting before someone could repaint the faces"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, peak-stress beats rely on filter verbs and abstract constructions ("felt a click like a door in her chest," "swallowed the fear") that dull immediacy, and the elevated register ("absurd in her palm," "bright when he recognized her impossible return") remains uniform under pressure rather than compressing to match urgency. Dialogue is functional but minimal. Distance control is clean, yet the prose does not modulate rhythmically with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: musician's idiom ("intervals between drops," "negative space," "silence around a note") and lyric compression. Diction stays character-particular. Minor friction: phrases like "prophecy spoken in code" and "vested hush" feel slightly elevated for the grotto moment but remain voice-motivated by the folkloric frame. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the whisper sequence, wider for backstory. No dialogue to judge. The final line's rhythm charges the closure without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, with narrative certainty calibrated to Lio's knowledge and perception ("he believed," "he understood," "he realized"). Diction is consistent and textured—"mossy and delighted," "buttress roots," "pearl gray"—with a lyric compression that matches the arbor's storybook logic. Two moments of filter-verb stacking ("he believed," "he trusted," "he felt," "he remembered") in the opening third slightly dull immediacy during the seed-sorting exposition, but pressure remains legible. Purposeful elision (the vault's opening mechanism, the elders' immediate reaction) is taught by the folklore frame and does not withhold facts Lio already knows. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective and bias-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable throughout; Mara's perceptual signature—clocks as lies, accidents as patterns, befriending uncertainty—flavors every observation. Corin's dialogue ("I had been leaving signs to lure someone who could listen to broken time") feels slightly elevated but remains legible within the piece's heightened diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the waterfall improvisation, broader during the greenhouse entry. One rhythm wobble: "roots hung like dark hair" and "black flakes still drifted down like moths" in close succession lean toward stock lyricism, though not enough to break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single first-person POV is stable throughout. Mara's perceptual signature—alchemical precision, focus on names as substance, regret coded as "newly polished shame"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches her craft expertise without jargon excess: "reagent," "distilled," "quench pit," "inlay." Rhythm modulates with pressure: the opening is reflective and detailed, the coin transformation accelerates, the confrontation with Ellis tightens, the ending slows into resolution. Dialogue with Ellis is brief but functional, his flinch and sob conveying guilt without exposition. Minor slip: "luminous regret" in the final sentence edges toward over-articulation, though it stays within Mara's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is selective (lantern unlit, crocodile tooth rubbed smooth by anxious fingers, mist beading on lashes). Diction remains consistent under pressure—"luminous ache," "woman of water glass"—and rhythmic control tightens during the confession exchange. Dialogue ("the gorge repeats what you hide," "Take it, and tell me the rest") pursues goals and evades, though Elowen's lines occasionally tilt toward perfect articulation for a specter mid-breakdown.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: proprioceptive precision, trauma-triggered memory flashes, embodied sense of angle and weight. Diction remains voice-consistent ("a bruise that gives light instead of taking it"), though some phrases drift toward elevated abstraction ("partitioned under drugs," "discounted by intention"). The single-sentence structure becomes formulaic in the second half, with multiple long appositional chains that flatten rhythm under peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent reflective texture ("listening until meaning takes shape"). Diction is elevated and poetic, fitting the narrator's occupation and tone, though some phrases ("elusively tangible like mist") trend toward stock lyricism. Perceptual signature is clear—translation metaphors shape how the narrator sees the world. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Elision is purposeful (the mother's death is mentioned, not dramatized) and serves the accumulative design. Register is consistent; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (descending, fitting the lens), compression does not obscure the narrator's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with controlled distance; perceptual signature is职业-specific ("dust never does," gear marks matched to beam lines). Voice remains distinct under pressure: "I am skillfully observant because I have to be" carries both competence and fatigue. Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—technical terms (mainspring barrel, zip tie, control cabinet) feel earned, not imported. The ghosts' silence and gesture create clean dramatic irony without head-hopping. Minor slip: "as lightly as lint on my sleeves" in the opening and "like a small heart" at closure risk poetic overreach, but the texture remains coherent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close for dust analysis, pulled back for ghost engagement, intimate again for the final reflection. No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("chiming with pressure changes," "draft of a new contract"), matching the surreal librarian's craft. Perceptual signature is clear: Lio reads frost like proofs, feels letters in the rollers' click. The ending's "present tense" phrasing and "mirror of that shifting sky" sustain voice under pressure. Minor deduction: "Each dawn, when the library cooled" and "Those patterns always began" slip into habitual summary at the outset; the urgency of this morning arrives late (line eight). No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV through Len is stable and voice is consistent: "poet's habit of naming shadows," "burnished sorrow," perceptual signature evident in how he reads "a different cadence, a poem of exile" in the shard's cut edges. Dialogue between Len and Yara carries subtext (careful courtesy hiding grief) and advances plot (negotiating shard for seal). Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the storm and confession. One penalty: register occasionally drifts elevated ("baroque," "nave," "strata") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, though this could be Len's poetic idiom. Yara's brief interior moment ("surprised by the gentleness") is clean free indirect. No head-hopping, tense is stable, perceptual filter holds. The phrase "defunct relic of that failed fire" reads slightly over-written but stays within a poet's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is distinct: Ivo reads tremors, polishes invisible scuffs, hears metal moods. Diction ("headache of quiet," "scraped brass") is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond immediate tactile need. The Thief's voice ("admitted, in a voice of scraped brass") is handled cleanly. However, runs of similar syntax ("He practiced," "He kept," "He climbed") and filter verbs ("understood," "making") cluster in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy and disqualifying 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with tight focalization through Mara's perceptual signature: "sensibly eccentric," rain labeled "by street and season," rocks that "remember machines." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during psychometry floods, slightly wider during travel passages. Diction is voice-consistent and particular: "petrichor collector," "hinged awakenings," "submerged mouth." No dialogue present; interiority carries the narrative without filter-verb stacks. The two psychometry visions risk brief POV leakage (expedition leader's exact thought), but the framing as borrowed memory keeps it bounded. Syntax varies with pressure: short fragments during the lagoon discovery, longer rhythms in the opening setup.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; Mara's perceptual signature (sculptor noticing "pale sticks," "bent crescent," layered meanings) is consistent. Diction stays within an educated artisan's register ("scaffold complexity," "timewoven alliances") without jarring leaps. The projection figures speak through gesture and mouthed words rather than full dialogue, which sidesteps voice-distinction tests. One rhythm slip: several mid-story sentences open with "She [verb]" or "Mara [verb]," creating a brief template cadence. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lina, with distinct perceptual filters (her artist's eye for "colors vivid enough to warm," "vines so fine they looked like scratches on ice"). The prose carries a lyric, elevated register that fits the reflective, memorial mode. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract literary constructions ("umbral tenderness," "palimpsest of botanical drawings") that feel more authorial than character-specific under pressure. The narrative certainty remains calibrated to what Lina can know, and the window discovery unfolds through her direct observation rather than exposition. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV; distance is stable; perceptual signature ("paper as evidence and grief as a datum," "searing reverie") is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction remains within the archivist's register (solemn, analytical, sensory). Two frictions: "the past tugged harder" and "the air thickened" tip toward stock metaphor, and one phrase—"telling her that archives are not graves but doors"—flirts with thematic echo in the parley beat. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Sen's perception and priorities (the bottle's warmth, his working memory, his fear of temptation). Voice carries a consistent, slightly elevated diction ("economy of miracles," "postcard to nobody") that matches an educated alchemist's internal texture. The line "he rejected false comfort as poison" and similar declarations occasionally slip into thesis-voice rather than lived perception, and the phrase "People had tried to soothe him with stories" introduces off-page exposition that sits oddly in a solitary character's present frame. Dialogue, when it appears, is sparse and functional ("what he wanted for it," "help hanging paper lanterns again"), lacking subtext or character-specific idiom. The psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs; filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are used sparingly and voice-appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable, single-focalizer third tracking Erem's perceptual signature: dead languages "as reflex," "emotional patterns that leak through words like sap through bark," the orchard scents braiding with phonograph rasp. Diction fits an oath scribe's register (vows, testimony, archive, cadence). Compression is purposeful: "dust of decades rose and he heard, impossibly, a heartbeat embedded in the wax." No head-hopping. Filter verbs (watches, hears, realizes) are voice-motivated and sparse. The final paragraph's syntax modulates pressure without obscuring clarity. One slip: "what we refuse to let happen" edges toward essayistic generalization, though it reads as Erem's profession-inflected thought.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lio throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct texture: "furiously tranquil," "wild serenity rising," "understanding hit like wind through reeds," and metaphors drawn from botany (summers a seed never lived, rows in a field). Psychic distance tightens during the corridor sequence, where time is felt as velvet, burlap, and pollen. However, elevated diction ("heirloom seed saver for a city that no longer trusted spring," "vortex inheritance passed down not in blood but in attention") occasionally drifts from the immediate scene into exposition, and some figurative clusters ("quiet storm in his chest," "wild serenity," "furiously tranquil") repeat the same tonal register without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maris; perceptual signature is clear (she reads vapor "like script," tracks microclimate with precise attention). Diction is mostly controlled and character-particular, though occasional elevated phrasing ("favor listening over noise," "made the sanctuary feel like a factory in the sky") reads slightly abstract for a storm siren tester's interiority. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Brother Ivo's confession and the dispatcher's demand both advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during sensor work, slightly wider during reflection). Minor slips: "credibly curious eyes" in the opening and "teaching people to listen and act instead of flinch" in the dispatcher exchange feel slightly authorial rather than fully character-voiced. No head-hopping, tense remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Lio's perceptual signature: he notices dust, charcoal arcs, generators ticking. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("spiritually curious enough to bow before meteor charts the way others bowed before saints"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the tracing ritual and the logbook discovery. Minor slip: "flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, though they remain legible within the contemplative frame. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean. The prose texture reflects Lio's contemplative stance, with rhythm modulating from slow opening to compressed final image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, first-person with distinct perceptual signature: the narrator reads weather "by the restless pitch of a hive," interprets ghosts through "contextual clues," and employs precise, tactile diction ("ash that settled on my tongue like vows"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during Mara's arrival ("astonishment finally made sound"), wider when cataloging other ghosts—and voice texture (syntax mixing lyric compression with longer, accretive rhythms) supports emotional intensity. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; elision of direct speech is voice-motivated and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is character-specific (Eli notices chronometric vents, vent chambers, seams). Distance control holds, no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent, with occasional elevated phrases ("hollow throat," "folded inward like a closing eyelid") that fit the lyric-accumulative mode. Dialogue is minimal and functional: Mara's lines advance plot without subtext depth. Free-indirect style is clean. One brief filter-verb cluster ("noticed how," "suspected someone") in the garage-sale paragraph slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure. Rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure at the capsule exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in tight third with consistent perceptual filters (Rian notices small flaws, attends to texture). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("barbules caught on the string like a hand trying to hold on") with purposeful compression that matches a poet's idiom. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue ("what breaks can still belong if you give it a task") reads as Rian's voice rather than authorial intrusion. One friction: the opening sentence runs long with nested subordinate clauses that slightly obscure the anchor, and "burnished hush that made even the reeds seem to listen" edges toward precious without clear payoff until the final callback to breath and lap of water.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with Mara's perceptual signature—"gently systematic," noticing which moss quieted bees—filtering all observations. Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding register drift. The dialogue in the gathering scene carries clear subtext (naming ignored species = public commitment) and advances plot. Weakness: the prose occasionally slips into elevated register during peak beats ("architectural secrets were not about hiding treasure but about distributing it") that feels more authorial than character-bound, slightly reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (biochemist notices terpenes, microcrystals, reaction clocks, tracer dyes). Diction matches the narrator's scientific lexicon ("volatile terpenes," "self assembling," "convergence of volatile molecules") without drift into therapy-speak or stock phrasing. Purposeful compression ("pattern too patient for weather," "bronze quiet") is taught early and legible. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: "the chemistry of homecoming that the signal seemed to promise" edges toward abstract phrasing in the opening, but recovers immediately with concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: the coachman interprets gull cries as naval Latin and Eel Speech, measures soil by touch and texture ("heavy and alive"), and frames every image through occupational ritual. Diction is elevated yet voice-consistent—"narrow as a spine," "unrolled scroll no hand can finish reading"—maintaining lyric compression without slipping into generic lyricism. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully: short declaratives during action ("I answer aloud"), longer accumulative clauses during reflection ("in that narrow strip of planks over an ocean too wide to mend"). The prose feels like character—a trained mediator parsing signs—and the compression is taught early, holding through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lio's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: naming by smell, reading grooves by lamplight, trusting the bloodhound over council words. Diction stays grounded in the POV's scavenger lexicon ("bolts cooling," "catwalks of welded rebar and prayer"). No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Sera's single line of dialogue ("Lio, keep the leaf...") reads purposeful and distinct from narration. Rhythm modulates under pressure: the cylinder-reading beat compresses syntax ("Letters rose... tinted revelations"), then opens for the broadcast finale. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak moments. The phrase "wild hush" recurs as tone anchor without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters everything through temporal disorientation ("breath unspooled behind me," "sound arrived with a delayed twin") and maritime/navigational idiom inherited from the grandmother. Diction remains consistent—"blessed pariah," "echoed silence," "patient pencil dust"—with purposeful compression in the lyric mode. The narrative voice maintains confidence calibrated to the protagonist's specialized knowledge of the station and grief ritual without withholding key information.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable, first-person voice carries a distinct idiom ("chivalrous thief keeps promises even to people he plans to rob"), and perceptual signature is consistent (noticing both locked secrets and atmospheric wrongness). Diction modulates well under pressure: short, urgent clauses during the climb and leap. The Skywright's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: "sacredly playful laughter" in the climax edges toward telling rather than showing the trait through gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent diction and perceptual signature: the narrator notices gestures ("finger tapping twice, a sleeve tugged down") and filters setting through historian's bias. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—compressed urgency when ripping cords, expansive reflection in the opening. Free indirect voice is clean; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous in their absence") but remains voice-consistent and purpose-driven for a self-aware scribe. No dialogue on the page to judge. Minor register watch: "swore to become the historian" and "luminous absence" read slightly literary for mid-crisis thought, but the effect coheres with the character's articulate, archival lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable with tight control over the protagonist's perceptual signature: "I told her… I said… I thought of…" The diction carries a consistent lyric-folk register—"soundless grammar," "seed it with one true memory," "compass needle made of breath"—that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. The seer's voice is distinct in its soft formality ("she called me by the name I had refused to remember"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the memory-seeding beat and the final escape. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; focalization is clean. The prose rhythm accelerates subtly as midnight nears, and the final sentence's syntactic sweep mirrors the release.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (chess-tutor lens, tactical vocabulary like "winnow," "advance, yield"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "fidgets productively," "fierce repose," "bright, pitiless logic." The innkeeper's brief dialogue at the end provides contrast without head-hopping. However, some figurative phrasing in peak beats ("snowflakes hovered like pinned notes," "sky had pinched the hour between two fingers") tilts slightly elevated for a exiled tutor's internal voice under stress, and "the patient game within her chest" in the final line, while resonant, edges ornamental rather than inevitable from her established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and image-driven, with strong perceptual signature ("forged hush," "listening metal," "pale ribs against a sky the color of ash"). Purposeful compression and poetic syntax are taught early and sustained. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Jalen's exchange and the chief elder's demand carry subtext and goal pursuit. However, psychic distance wobbles: the opening reads close third, then pulls back to summarize crowd reactions and the killer's presence without anchoring whose knowledge frames those observations. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "innocently mischievous" reads as authorial commentary rather than self-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is densely lyric and consistent ("certainty melts here faster than iron," "speech is the only spell that still obeys me"), with a perceptual signature filtered through alchemical metaphor and the acid-sea setting. POV distance is stable; Lysa's interior monologue and embodied action cohere. Minor deductions: some sentences stack figurative language at high density without pattern-teaching (e.g., "my mind quilts memories together, stitching a pattern from what the acid fog tries to erase" follows a prior metaphor cluster), risking slight overwriting. The narration modulates well under pressure (breath-holds, repair urgency) and the closing reflection integrates smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a painter's perceptual signature—"exact blue that appears for a minute between tide and streetlamp," "draft that smells of crushed kelp and candle smoke." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The cave monologue is handled as reported thought rather than dialogue, maintaining interiority. However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "temporary eternity" as a coined phrase, "the distance was not dignity but fear," and the final paragraph's summary cadence ("the kind of marker that will not last forever") flatten the specificity. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but peak moments favor articulation over compression.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single first-person POV remains stable. Perceptual signature is consistent: "softer kind of thunder," "screaming tenderness," "teeth sing." Psychic distance tightens during the ritual and opens slightly at Jonas's arrival. Minor filter-verb reliance ("I felt a screaming tenderness") in one high-pressure beat, but voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy. Diction—"purifies intentions the way lime purifies water," "beckoned the message by the scent of a garden"—stays within the narrator's lyric-technical register. No head-hopping; Jonas's shame is inferred through visible behavior ("looked ashamed").

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "patchwork navigator" filters experience through cartographic metaphor (plotting numbers against star positions, "geography of loss"). Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure: "raw solace," "grief," "half wound opening" avoid therapy-speak while maintaining emotional honesty. Distance modulates purposefully from technical ("hydraulics dead, roof lens will not raise") to relational ("what I have built is not a machine but a promise"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate for naturalism or subtext. Minor slip: the single-sentence structure "I stay anyway, because I am…" and "I give her the raw solace I can, admitting…" share a stem pattern that slightly flattens rhythm, but the effect remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices the orchard's sway, reads ground "like a ledger," filters storm details through forager expertise. Diction is controlled and character-specific ("truth is a kind of shrapnel," "static empathy"). Lio's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Under peak stress (Ministry encounter), compression tightens appropriately. One minor slip: "my fractured grace was to keep choosing it" in the final line drifts slightly toward authorial thematic vocabulary rather than Mara's established idiom, though it remains broadly within her reflective voice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV (harbor clerk narrator) with stable psychic distance and perceptual signature: "I was the harbor clerk, sent only to witness," filtering all events through observation. Eamon's voice is distinct in dialogue ("the empty grip was a message he could not read," "the footprints of intent"). Diction remains controlled—"softly persistent," "as if he spoke to the fog"—and rhythmically varied. Free indirect style is clean when tracking Eamon's process. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final sentence shifts cadence to land the thematic charge without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (empirically intuitive, trusting measurements and small patterns) is specific and consistent. Diction stays controlled—"contours," "futures like paper"—without register drift. Ellis's dialogue ("every choice is typeset") feels slightly expository, and the final narrator claim ("understood the doorway…was the moment she stepped through") edges toward over-articulation, but the prior embodied climb earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maelin; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and heightens pressure ("velvet dragged over glass," "embroidery over shale"). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and advances stakes ("we wait for the first fireflies of summer"). Perceptual signature is consistent (courtly formality under duress). Minor: elevated register ("cobalt grotto above clouds," "polite and persistent as lace") occasionally feels authorial rather than character-interior, especially under peak stress. Filter verbs are minimal. The final sentence's rhythm—"that plainness frightened her more than any omen, because it meant the choice was truly hers"—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV on Lio is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—alchemist diction ("density of presence," "trap noon," "palette of resolve")—and the prose modulates with pressure (short declaratives at the decision beat: "He would return…not as surrender"). However, the voice leans toward poetic assertion in high-pressure moments ("heavy as honeyed air," "the secret between them became a plan") where concrete embodiment would sharpen impact. Filter verbs ("felt again," "understood") appear but don't stack heavily. Dialogue is minimal; Toma's two lines feel natural and goal-driven. The final phrase "revalue freedom by returning differently" edges toward thematic summary but remains tied to the enacted image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled: "the pines stood like witnesses with needles dull from old snow," "nostalgia… hunts it, teeth out," "I dove toward him, meaning to warn him, but the dream rewound." Perceptual signature is character-specific (trade-based observation, jealousy as escape method). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("not like a bird but like a page torn free") and non-standard syntax ("while my older self hovered above, stained with the same weary surprise") are legible and voice-motivated. Minor slip: "jaded wonder, like a miracle delivered by a clerk" and "feral nostalgia, the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it" use appositive glosses that slightly over-articulate the effect, edging toward explanatory interiority in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Iris's perceptual signature (pressure dents, ink blots, shaky spaces) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and literary without rupture. However, voice edges toward elevated register at emotional peaks ("trembling calm," "ordinary miracles," "humanize the request") that feel slightly external to urgent interiority. The single line of dialogue ("Your hands held a life in place when time slipped, and no tool is stronger than that") reads purposeful but over-polished for spontaneous speech under pressure. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "watched") cluster in the birthing-house beat without reducing clarity but slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, stable third-close with consistent perceptual signature: storm scent as memory trigger, scars as contagion, breath as spillable tea. Diction stays character-bound ("mineral scent," "blisters while a person keeps moving"). Free indirect style is clean. Deduction: "saturated hush," "the lattice of burn marks," "the surest way to set them in order" drift into elevated register during peak beats, and the master's whispered exposition ("old fears are also runes") reads more writerly than spoken. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "remembered") cluster in the opening third without harming immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marin's practical, metaphor-laden perspective. Diction is elevated but character-consistent ("half columnist, half exorcist," "shopwork miracles"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Marin notices wire, current, scent, and séance room cues—and stays consistent under pressure. One brief register slip: "the kind of silence that had a name" reads slightly abstract for Marin's otherwise concrete voice, but it's an opening flourish that the rest of the prose corrects. No dialogue is present; all internal and sensory work carries the voice load successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent distance and perceptual signature (philosophical, reflective, precise). The phrase "wanderingly exact" is embodied in the narrator's deliberate attention to each footfall and breath while the mind roams through memories. However, diction drifts into elevated philosophical register throughout ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions," "unified truths") that reads more like essay than lived experience. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator's voice remains abstractly literary rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with Ivar's perceptual signature ("he spoke to pipes like sheep," "a clock…did not measure time but pressure, wear, hunger"). Diction remains character-consistent: technical ("escapement clicked unevenly"), pastoral ("like sheep"), and philosophical ("meaning is chosen"). The inspector's speech is brief and functional, carrying goal and status shift without full voice distinction, but no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance tightens during the probe insertion and sighting beats. Minor filter-verb presence ("he felt the click") fits voice and does not dull immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "theoretically rebellious," "lucky and bruised," "grief felt like clover." Diction remains stable in the daughter's voice—educated yet emotionally particular. Purposeful compression in the scavenger-hunt beats maintains momentum. Small slip: "lucid contradiction so clear it felt like instruction" edges toward overt theme labeling, and the father's final line "the best bet was learning to stop" reads slightly didactic rather than voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is clear—she notices "rust," "copper," "thin enough to slip between the rails." Narrative distance tightens in the crisis: "she heard her own tunnel breathing and imagined Lena on the surface" modulates from exterior observation to interior projection without head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "cultivated estrangement," "angled, like mirrors turned from direct light" matches an operator who builds rituals from abstractions. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—"tell me what you needed to say before you hang up" pursues connection through indirection, and Mara's closing line to Lena carries subtext (the apology and invitation are implicit, not declared). One minor slip: "melodically haunted chord" in the opening slightly over-reaches the POV's lexical register, though it recurs purposefully and becomes voice-signature by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature: she notices tannins, walnut broth color, the texture of parchment. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "dead fishermen murmuring under the pier" and "joy had to borrow a ghost's throat to be heard" maintaining lyric consistency. Brief dialogue (mayor, priest) feels purposeful and advances plot without head-hopping. One friction: the phrase "haunted euphoria" appears as both free indirect thought and then as if objectively confirmed by the crowd's reaction, blurring the line between Mara's interpretation and narratorial claim. Distance stays intentional overall.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending wry observation ("altar built by pranksters with excellent manners") with lyric compression ("alive but unclaimed"). POV distance is stable first-person, and interiority stays character-bound. Mara's dialogue carries subtext ("you look terrible, so you must be serious") and distinct idiom. Minor slips: "the barber, a priest, and a scrapyard dog" risks quirk-list texture, and the phrase "when the story changes" is a meta-narrator intrusion that briefly breaks immersion. Diction remains consistent under pressure, and the final lines maintain voice through image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual filtering consistent to Iris's blindness (air currents, skin languages, pressure of sound). Diction stays elevated and lyric, appropriate to the contemplative accumulative mode. However, register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("letting foreign alphabets bloom as tingling patterns," "grammar of heartbeats") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The prose compresses sensation into metaphor densely, which suits the mode but occasionally obscures immediate physical action. No dialogue is present; voice distinction does not apply. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "confidently uncertain," "imagine words filling themselves later," "thresh meaning from experience." Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("contingent relationships," "modest kindness," "invitations to thresh meaning") that feels slightly outside Mara's lived idiom during peak beats. The final paragraph's "warmth that comes from admitting how contingent every life is" edges toward essayistic voice. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (the nib-unbending beat tightens syntax effectively).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable, first-person, with a distinct lyric perceptual signature (lanterns as commas, "soft ache of being unseen"). Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, consistent with the focalizer's interior idiom. Aster's whispered directions and the protagonist's signed apologies create purposeful gestural texture. Minor register drift: phrases like "coordinates into a melody" and "joyful sorrow threading through my wrists" approach abstract diction at peak beats, but remain legible within the established voice and do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Sera; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("analytically intuitive, able to feel a pattern in her ribs and then prove it with numbers") and shapes her decryption method. Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into exposition ("the courage to reveal herself"). Filter verbs and declarative interiority ("she understood he was asking") flatten immediacy in key beats. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("eyes precise, mouth soft, hands stained with soot"), but peak moments lean on summary ("her chest roared, the old arsonist in her begging for flame") rather than showing the conflict through action.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close during the trance, wider during aftermath). However, diction frequently elevates beyond the narrator's plausible stress register: "auroral sorrow," "memories arrived not as scenes but as chords," "sorrow turned auroral, a curtain of color." These lyric reaches are consistent but border on committee voice, smoothing the narrator's panic into polished metaphor. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Sato's whispered objection and admission land naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (aural focus, spatial-kinesthetic intelligence). Diction fits her professional idiom. Len's brief dialogue feels purposeful but there is insufficient exchange to test true voice distinction between characters. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "calculated spontaneity was her style" reads as external character-summary rather than lived thought. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the rescue, longer syntactic flow in the opening). The piece avoids filter-verb stacks and head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV third-limited holds stable; perceptual signature is lyric and filtered through heightened metaphor ("ribs were a staircase winding down to the water"). Psychic distance remains consistent, with controlled elevation in diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension"). Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (star, mirror, lattice) are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor slip: "the habit of meeting confession with room instead of questions" leans slightly expository, though brief.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable psychic distance and Eli's perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words). The mayor's interiority at the library steps ("her unspoken memory of climbing those same trees") breaches focalization briefly, though the effect reads as Eli's inference. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, but some register drift appears: "amplified quiet," "forests of second thoughts," "the hush where past meets prophecy" feel more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "what kind of town...") and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "hawser like a dancer," "barnacles bit," "combative tenderness, sharp words wrapped around careful respect." Voice modulates under pressure—short syntax when diving ("I dove... found... waited"), lyric compression at closure ("let the sea claim my truest shape"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Rusk's "Do not do this" fights the plea in his face; the protagonist's response about truer language persuades without lecturing. Minor convergence: a few late beats ("spared," "ready to yield") edge toward elevated diction, though they remain voice-plausible for a lyric narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "the air in the rooms still carried her last laugh like a bruise" is grief-specific metaphor. Orin's theatrical diction contrasts cleanly with the narrator's spare interiority. The line "his blank face stayed still" maintains distance without head-hopping. However, "I understood that lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move" edges toward diagnostic articulation rather than staying within the grief-fogged register established earlier, a mild register drift under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with a distinct perceptual signature: "lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "grief look symmetrical." Focalization is stable; no head-hopping. However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels more authorial than character-specific ("sensation in her teeth, the way truth sometimes arrives quietly"). Soren's interiority is briefly accessed when he "recoils, suddenly afraid of his own hands," which reads as clean free indirect style. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Lira's paraphrase of Soren's warning drives the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited, Mara-focalized, with stable distance and purposeful diction ("innocently cunning," "lever that does not feel like cruelty"). The plant-language sequences are legible and voice-distinct. Joren's single spoken line ("the reed tongue once belonged to…") carries subtext (confession, warning). However, late in the story the narration accesses Joren's interior certainty ("something in him wakes that is not for sale") without clear signal, a brief focalization slip that clouds POV boundaries. The prose rhythm modulates well—compressed negotiation beats, then the lyric spiral-walk passage. No dialogue-tag clutter; perceptual signature is Mara's tactical eye, though colorblindness (her defining trait) does not color her on-page perception after the opening sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature (acoustic focus: "overtones," "textured air," "sigh that sounded like a crowd turning together"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, balancing lyric compression ("small sun in shadow") with grounded idiom ("Mara snorted"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Mara's "powerfully gentle" and the narrator's pilgrimage analogy carry subtext about values. Filter verbs ("I told," "she argued") are present but not excessive. Minor pattern: several beats open with "I [verb]" or "Mara [verb]" stems in sequence, creating mild syntactic monotony in the middle third. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The phrase "my job was to ring truths without shattering hands" reads slightly elevated for the moment but remains within the narrator's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable distance and filters perception through Mara's jeweler idiom ("every pendant…a small coffin, each clasp a promise"). Diction remains elevated but consistent: "subdued ardor," "muted glow," "narrow corridor of shadow and light." Lysa's brief dialogue ("how anything could live again") feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure ("imagined her husband beside her"). Two weaknesses: the long opening sentence stacks abstractions ("mornings she wished she could forget," "ashes she carried in a jar of salt") without immediate spatial grounding, causing brief orientation lag; Sen's exposition about curtains is functional but borders on tour-guide voice. Under pressure, voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and layered: "listening hush," "writing in night," "rain stitched the dusk into silver lines." The narrator's perceptual signature (measuring everything before trusting it) remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Aurel's single line of dialogue ("said my grandmother had confided…") and his later traced-thumb gesture carry subtext (shame, vow). The prose modulates appropriately with pressure but occasionally edges toward elevated diction ("multiplying paths") that, while thematic, slightly distances the reader. Filter verbs ("I heard," "I understood") appear but are voice-motivated. No POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: saffron veil, dust, copper taste, light corridors. Diction is elevated and lyric ("steadily unpredictable," "atoms of nostalgia cling to ink, bone, and breath"), fitting the archival world. No head-hopping. However, register drifts toward abstract exposition in mid-passage ("memory is a story we tell ourselves," "purification by avoiding patterns had purified me") without POV-specific idiom anchoring those insights to the historian's lived experience in the vault.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is distinct ("sharp eyed dusk noticer," "a candle for the last room"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which fits the Blooming Library's fantastical register, but under peak pressure (the shadow's metamorphosis) the syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices edges, thresholds, absences. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. The patron-teaching beat shifts briefly to instruction-mode voice but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV distance is stable; diction matches Mara's careful, animal-handler sensibility ("heat lamps glowed like small moons," "her compassion had found a spine"). The call with Tessa carries subtext through Mara's listening "until the anger thinned, layer by layer." Minor slip: occasional elevated phrasing ("to balance self-respect and compassion") slightly abstracts the texture but remains within plausible internal voice. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature: "meteor hush," coffee rings as "the only maps she trusts," pain as satisfaction and dread. Diction remains consistent ("chlorophyll syllables," "the thought tastes like copper") and purposeful compression ("the plants have been drinking that light ever since") aids density. However, the narrator occasionally leans omniscient when claiming the tower "keeps" a greenhouse and describing the miracle's hunger with unearned certainty. The ivy's dialogue ("put it in the street") and the wound "speaking in real time" blur the line between metaphor and literal telepathy without clear POV anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens during the vision and the projection ritual. Voice is distinct—lyric compression ("burglar of light," "shame itself had archived it"), metaphor-dense but purposeful, and rhythm modulates with pressure (short clauses at closure: "not farewell but deliver"). Filter verbs ("wondered," "realized," "understood") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; Mara's perceptual signature (spatial imagination, mapping emotions to coordinates) is consistent. Diction remains within the focalizer's idiom; elevated register suits the lyric mode and is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Sel hears unspoken words, tastes stardust) and voice-specific ("bruise of green fire," "relieved throat"). Distance control is steady, though some phrases ("shadowed rapture," "aurora-lit archway") recur mechanically without modulation under pressure. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the vault opening. No dialogue present to evaluate. Prose as character is evident but occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("wanderers," "rapture") that slightly exceeds the focalizer's established lexicon during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the guard's perceptual signature—"sparks," "wave functions," "occasionally everywhere"—is consistent and voice-motivated. Syntax modulates purposefully: long, layered sentences during archive exploration compress into shorter beats at the auditor encounter. Diction remains within a lyric-industrial register without jarring shifts. However, psychic distance stays remote throughout; peak moments lack embodied immediacy, and the voice reads more as atmospheric narrator than a mind under pressure. No dialogue appears; focal control is clean but lacks rhythmic tightening at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: "I was a stray philosopher, paid in leftovers and questions" establishes idiom, and diction like "my body had been mailed" and "unspooled, as if my body were a thread" sustains metaphoric coherence under pressure. POV remains stable (single first-person), and perceptual signature is consistent (philosophical attention to paradox, wind-as-logic). However, at peak stress the syntax remains steady rather than degrading or compressing, and some constructions ("made tears reasonable," "that was miracle enough to be probable") feel slightly polished for a mind in crisis, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds Mara's perceptual signature consistently: metaphors drawn from the sea (frayed like seafoam, oilskins faded to moonlit kelp), and her attention filters setting through fear and memory. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the vigil reflection, pulled back during the crossing—and no head-hopping occurs. The guides' speech carries faint archaic texture ("You are here to find…") that distinguishes them from Mara's modern interiority, though their voices converge slightly in wise-elder register. One line—"and in that sound she hears the quiet part of herself that always waits"—edges toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds her terror-narrowed state. Filter verbs ("she understands," "she begins to believe") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: the bellhop notices "the slightest discoloration, a thumbprint of darker dust" and filters all action through the lens of enforced silence and institutional complicity. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "small flag of surrender." Dialogue is minimal and purposeful—Edda's cracked-lip question, the therapist's sign language, the single whispered "C"—each advances plot and subtext. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor issue: "the unpardonable silence" phrase appears twice in slightly different framings (opening and Edda's moment), creating a faint echo that risks over-emphasizing theme, but the second use is contextually distinct enough to avoid pure repetition. Pronoun clarity is maintained, tense is consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates well under pressure (longer, layered sentences in discovery; shorter, tighter ones during the whisper and director's arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and a lyric, elevated register ("dust fell in slow arcs like collapsed prayers," "ladders folding," "constellations shifting so slowly that an hour became a season"). Diction is consistent and voice-specific, with phrases like "regally unpretentious" and "heavens above the broken oculus paused" establishing a mythic-archival tone. However, some constructions veer toward ornamental opacity ("a hairline crack on the royal seal, made by a chisel not of goldsmiths but of those who counterfeit" is circuitous), and the narrator occasionally over-explains ("because the pretender had bound his claim to a borrowed constellation and hidden the proof inside time itself"). The compression of syntax during the library collapse maintains pressure without losing clarity, though the final paragraph's summary mode ("refused the offered crown… appointed a council… walked back") flattens what should be a charged renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance remains stable third-close throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices millimeters, beacon schedules, and coral heads with professional granularity, while emotional filtering shows in "trying not to smell the reef" and "a question she could not ask anyone." Diction stays within her lexicon—scientific yet plainspoken—with controlled modulations under pressure. The single exchange with the hooded woman is brief but functional, goal-driven rather than expository. Purposeful compression in the middle third (monthly attempts summarized, lunar cycle condensed) maintains momentum without obscuring causality. Minor slip: "the delayed revelation struck her harder than guilt" tells rather than shows the emotional shift, and the phrase "periodically eternal" in the final line drifts slightly toward abstraction, though it remains voice-plausible as reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ilya; perceptual signature is specific (stargazer who refuses boots, judges distances through opera glasses, counts beats by star positions). Diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("thunderous serenity," "margin of daylight") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. However, some filter verbs ("realized," "saw," "felt") dull immediacy in peak beats, and a few constructions drift toward omniscient framing ("as if the storm were a drummer") without full grounding in Ilya's interiority. The phrase "awkwardly confident" is told early but demonstrated in gesture; overall voice is distinct and controlled, with only minor slips under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV with tight focus on the narrator (grandchild). Voice is distinct: lyric compression, purposeful sentence fragments ("Stone roads over ash and called it peace"), controlled rhythm. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during plant-communication moments, wider during Nara's history. Nara's dialogue ("that was why the priests used newborns, because newborns have no will yet") carries subtext but reads slightly expository at the peak beat. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. The prose compresses time smoothly ("For weeks the springs were crowded…") and the final paragraph's shift to summary fits the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is clean; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight during panic, wider during tactical planning). Perceptual signature is distinct: Mina notices bodily signals, tree labels, and crease lines as maps. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the exchange with the teen operator and Dr. Harlow advances plot. Minor diction drift: "somatic markers" and "pearl of stillness" read slightly elevated for in-scene coinage, but the latter is explicitly named as Mina's term. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature favors visual and tactile detail filtered through an artist's lens ("cracked mirror," "ribs," "luminescent ache"). Voice is lyric and metaphor-dense, which fits the accumulative mode but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("articulate ache," "bleed light into uncertainty") that edges beyond interiority into authorial narration. Psychic distance compresses appropriately under pressure (the descent, the weaving), and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm modulates well from the opening's despair to the closing's calm resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Keir throughout, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated-lyric register ("serene anger," "consciously wild," "ephemeral patterns") that fits the tracker's reflective stance but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the world thickened and seconds stretched"). Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, zooming in for micro-choices and pulling back for the journey. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. At peak pressure (canyon sabotage), the prose maintains texture but leans on passive constructions ("was being used," "could have fled") that slightly dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (ink vanishing when truth approaches, arrows hanging like syrup) but could be more idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in the archivist's professional idiom ("nitrogen," "thaw schedules," "indexing consoles"). The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening syntax as the protagonist decides. However, runs of long, clause-heavy sentences occasionally flatten urgency in peak beats, and some filter verbs ("I understood," "I realized") could be trimmed for immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Mara's question to the Censor carries subtext and advances the confrontation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited through Maris with clear focalization. The perceptual signature is distinct—"senselessly perceptive attention," "watched his shoulders soften," "seeing without sensing why"—and vocabulary fits an artisan's idiom. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register: "inculcating plants with values," "a way to weave continuity through chaos," "the need for builders, not trophies" all read slightly above Maris's embodied voice under pressure. Tarek's dialogue to the militia leader is summarized rather than quoted, which avoids the test of voice distinction. The final paragraph's certainty ("certain that continuity could be grown") asserts resolution rather than letting the image carry it. Psychic distance is otherwise consistent and narrative stance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Rovan; perceptual signature is consistent (metallic memory, measured calm, respect for storms). Diction remains character-particular ("cool-headed," "zigzag," "feral lullaby") with strong rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift: "transliterates emotions into marks" and "half asleep" occasionally elevate beyond the established idiom. Mera's brief dialogue ("Do it by voicing silence, or the echo will bite you back") carries subtext and advances plot cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Celeste; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (she hears tremors, watches hands, tests contradictions). Dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext (Sato's "memorized" jokes, Celeste's pretended charm). Minor deductions: "solemn playfulness" appears twice as a stated label rather than enacted rhythm, and several beats lean on filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") where immediacy could sharpen. The rosewood-nib image and "echoes...like applause" charge the final moment, but the phrase "as if she were teasing a headline into behaving" drifts toward explaining tone rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lio; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight during the translation, wider during the letter exposition). Perceptual signature is consistent: sounds become tactile ("needle buzz sounded like a baby crying under water"), and celestial metaphors (meteor showers, starlight, comet tail) filter every image. The prose is distinct and controlled. However, Dr. Sato's explanation—"she had been gathering caretakers who carried similar failures in their bones"—reads as helpful-narrator exposition rather than dramatized discovery. Diction remains within Lio's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Inez with a distinct perceptual signature: she "read sidewalks" and sees pauses between words. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at key beats. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"emergent hush," "lilac unease," "the socially perceptive part of Inez"—that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The boy's single line of dialogue is natural; Inez's closing speech ("it meant they were still capable of choosing what to keep") reads slightly formal for spoken thought. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no head-hopping occurs, but voice under peak pressure leans toward the poetic rather than the urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds Samir's POV cleanly with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "a ruin could be a mirror," "the chips spelled a route," "warmth that felt cold." Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lina's "why he collected ruins instead of weapons" and her question about naming the punishment advance plot. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("dissident's patience," "aberrant mercy") that risks slipping outside embodied perception under stress, though it remains mostly voice-coherent. The final paragraph's narrative certainty about the future ("served a future he had named") stretches POV modesty slightly but stays within inferential bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Mara; psychic distance is consistent and voice carries a lyric, compression-heavy texture apt for synesthetic experience. The prose's perceptual signature—colors have tastes, sounds have textures—is specific and filters all description. One sentence approaches passive withholding: "its edges warm from her pocket" appears before we know she has the coin, creating brief spatial confusion. The long first sentence and patterned elision (e.g., "which sounded like a gift until…") are voice-motivated and taught early, supporting the accumulative design. No dialogue is present, so no dialogue tests apply.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Mara's empirical attention to bodies, light, and patterns). Dialogue is minimal but functional: Jory's plea and Mara's refusal/protocol offer advance plot. However, the prose carries mild template cadence and elevated diction throughout ("affectionate skeptic who hugged friends first," "willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken") that feels more constructed than voice-particular. The final "what mattered was that, after the shock, they had learned to listen for paths" reads as thematic closure rather than Mara's idiolect under pressure, slightly flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with intimate psychic distance; Mina's perceptual signature (heat-mapping emotions, sensory training idiom) is consistent and voice-particular. Diction matches her lens: "factually mystical," "heat-swept edges of something like longing," "enormous sleeping body." Reflection anchors in present stimuli (fossil pulse, limestone touch) and tilts present stance. Minor slip: "jointed handprints" and "she set the elm leaf fossil into a niche...watched it float once more and settle like a promise" compresses the floating-settling sequence slightly; the simultaneity is legible but rushes the final beat's temporal unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("silence lay unearthed, as if the rock itself had been dug up"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose leans heavily on elevated diction ("stubborn things," "braid of voices," "canyon echo") that occasionally feels imposed rather than organically Lysa's idiom. Dialogue is absent. The foreman and workers are named roles without individuated speech or thought, reducing voice distinctness. The grandmother's method is summarized rather than shown through Lysa's perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Rina; psychic distance is stable and apt. Diction—"vouchsafed," "prudently daring," "silver hush"—is elevated and voice-consistent, though at times it leans toward lyric formality that may distance immediacy. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven ("You came back" carries subtext). The perceptual signature (spy tradecraft: "scanned the snow the way a reader scans a page") is character-specific and maintained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "spindrift serenity," "scabbed and scraped," "arguments and paperwork collapse into one simple fact." Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Rowan. Senn's speech ("I traded Mara for my office") feels slightly templated for a high-pressure confession but serves the causal need. Minor register drift: "ambient awareness" and "distill complexity into essence" edge toward prompt echo rather than Rowan's idiom under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Galen; perceptual signature is consistent (potter's analogies: "hives stacked like little kilns," "held...the way he held unfired bowls"). Diction remains character-specific and controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Sera's line "she hated it for refusing to die" carries subtext and advances the thematic question. No head-hopping, and the voice modulates appropriately with intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Mara notices wind-threat to seedlings, translates sunrise into stairwell safety). Diction remains within POV lexicon with occasional lyric elevation ("quivering hush," "luminous spill") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. Jonas's single line of dialogue reads natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs are sparse. The rhythmic control under pressure (oar cadence instilling courage) heightens without obscuring clarity. Minor: some figurative density in transit beats ("thin green ladder," "bones in moonlight") borders on decorative but stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: "moa eyes catching dawn, brief and unrepeatable" and "the silence gave my thoughts room to learn new shapes." Distance remains stable; the narrator's register—lyric but grounded—fits the reincarnated contemporary voice. Purposeful compression ("the hum grew clear, a low chord that vibrated in my teeth") accelerates without obscuring. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates cleanly under pressure (sundial warming, light-script lifting). Free indirect thought is controlled. Minor note: a few filter verbs ("I realized," "I understood") are acceptable in this reflective mode but cluster slightly in the stone-circle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric diction ("pale and angular, as if folded from dawn," "prismatic quiet") suits the whimsical ghostwriter persona. POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (Suri's invitation, Arin's request). Minor issue: occasional elevated phrasing ("leftover bruises," "constellation") edges toward decorative in a few non-peak beats, and one brief passage clusters filter verbs without voice justification. Perceptual signature (envelopes, ink, threads) is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("braided sound to starlight," "baited meanings"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. The manager and chair lack differentiated speech or gesture—both appear only as externalized pressure without voice distinction. Under peak stress (2:13 a.m. climax), syntax remains ornate ("inaudible lattice," "prayer spoken through concrete") rather than compressing with urgency, which slightly undercuts psychic distance modulation. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (architectural metaphors, sonar-listening, geometric vocabulary) remains consistent and distinct. Vocabulary fits an educated explorer's register without jarring leaps. However, diction under peak pressure ("fear was only another measurement," "wistful rebellion that remembered all the maps I had loved and outgrown") elevates into thesis-adjacent phrasing that slightly dilutes immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully. The organ-as-guide conceit is taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person voice carries distinct diction ("furrowed hush," "lance the air with my pencil tip") and a methodical perceptual signature (columns, rows, plumb checks). Psychic distance remains stable, and the face-blindness filters observation consistently. Two weaknesses lower the score: Maren's dialogue summary ("she confesses that during the Masque she lured...") compresses the climax into exposition rather than letting speech pursue and evade goals, and the narrator's offer ("I offer to paint...if she tells") reads stiffly formal at peak pressure. Filter verbs ("I ask her," "I tell her") cluster in the final third without adding immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated diction that suits an archival librarian ("looking for repeated bearings and rhymes that might be code"). However, some register drift appears: "as if questions were weather too, capable of turning" and "the dread in her chest felt spongey, swelling with cold water" are memorable but occasionally tilt toward authorial metaphor rather than Mara's exact idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Sato's exposition is clear but not highly individuated. Distance control is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "bridge-song fiddler," "dynamically observant," and the extended metaphors (collodion as "moonlit syrup," scaffold wrap as "flag that refused to choose a country") maintain a consistent lyric register. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (noticing tire hiss, boot prints ending midstride) is character-specific. Under peak pressure (developing the plate, seeing the hitchhiker), diction compresses without breaking coherence. Minor slips: "luminous disbelief" is repeated exactly without evolution, and some figurative language in the middle third (pixelated amnesty "as if mercy itself required deliberate forgetting") tilts toward abstraction. Overall, strong voice with minor texture slips.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters setting through learned calm, notices unseen turns, and interprets markers as territorial questions. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully—compressed during action ("I met them on the tracks and, without raising my voice, dissuaded them"), then expands for reflection ("I told her fear is another loop"). Mara's brief dialogue ("why I never seemed afraid," "what I would do now") serves goal pursuit and subtext. One convergence issue: the narrator's syntax remains consistently lyric-elevated even under peak stress (the lawsuit collapse, the final night), missing an opportunity for cadence shift that would embody pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature—charting stars, lucid dreaming, chronicling—is distinct. Diction is often elevated and lyric ("chronicles are also vessels," "particular midnight solace"), which suits the contemplative mode but occasionally slips into generic abstraction ("words are bridges in that place"). Dialogue is minimal (Nera's journal reading, the narrator's answering phrases) and serves function without strong subtext. Under peak stress (the dream decode, the rite), sentence rhythm compresses naturally. No filter-verb stacks or major POV leakage, but the narrator's voice feels more consistent than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "I was Thalen, a guarded druid...They called me Finder because lost things drifted toward my steps." Psychic distance is controlled, and the conjurer's twin's apology arrives as bubbles-become-syllables, a clean free-indirect rendering. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the established register—"the wish to be seen without being known" reads slightly abstract for a reed-clan druid mid-crisis—but the overall idiom (reed staff, war-chant, warlike serenity) holds. The guards and conjurer are minimally on the page; no dialogue to test voice distinction. Brief filter-verb clusters ("I understood then," "I told them") are acceptable within the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lysa with consistent psychic distance and perceptual bias (e.g., "anxious elation," sensory anchors like "voice dry as bark"). Diction is purposeful: "root-bound visionary," "slow sap breaths," "stitched rivers" create a coherent metaphoric texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional: "Heed me" and "offer a wound" carry subtext of cost and warning. Two slips: "the rumor was true and she could not pretend anymore" tells rather than showing what she pretended; "behind glass" in the vision lacks prior setup, creating mild filter confusion. The phrase "harsh light spill through" shifts register slightly toward abstraction under peak pressure, though not enough to fracture voice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent third-limited POV anchored in Mira's divinatory perceptual signature: "reading the angle of roots as runes and the bone heaps as punctuation." Diction remains character-particular ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle") and lexicon stays consistent. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext (Vey's "only renewed" deflects responsibility; Mira's "you owe my brother his soul" asserts moral claim). Two register slips: "barrow a strangers clean destiny" (likely "borrow," though "barrow" could be voice-motivated archaism—unclear) and "trammel" used twice in different senses (first as verb meaning constrain/bind, second possibly meaning transfer), which may confuse rather than enrich. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable first-person with consistent distance and perceptual signature (roadie-turned-appraiser noticing "manufacturer marks, corrosion patterns" and hands remembering "touring catalogs"). Voice modulates appropriately from defensive early cataloging to vulnerable final delivery. The narrative certainty stays within character knowledge; past-tense reflection is cleanly anchored to present stimuli (the cloth triggering memory of the valley show). Marla's single line of dialogue feels natural and advances plot. One minor register slip: "wrest meaning from it the way I used to wrest a stubborn road case" borders on overly literary phrasing for crisis processing, and "what you do after it" at the end risks slight distance break into summative wisdom, though both remain plausibly within the introspective narrator's register.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority in grief beats, slight remove in observatory description). Perceptual signature is character-specific: translator's analogical thinking, tactile attention to clay and copper. Diction remains consistent ("wedges on clay," "conjugation," "grammatical marker") and voice-motivated. One slip: "the one thing a spirit carries across" momentarily adopts an omniscient certainty not strictly POV-modest; the beat recovers quickly but the lapse nudges the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: archival metaphors ("watermarks rising on the mind"), the neoprene/bronze embodiment, and a reflective yet grounded register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the creel wade, broader when explaining city practices. The narrator's inference ("I learned") and future projections ("the moon would change again") stay within plausible knowledge. Compression in the smelting and ritual-building passage is purposeful and advances rather than stalls. One friction: the phrase "our recollections thinned with it" and similar collective-observer moments briefly widen lens without clear cue, though they recover quickly and the ending returns to intimate focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is professional and specific: "tapping steel doors and counting filters," "latent radiance, the soft afterglow that blooms when truth is finally named." Diction stays consistent (no register drift), and narrative distance modulates purposefully from detached inspection to intimate witness. The widower's direct speech—"it was all he had left from the sea," "the pearl awakened via confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral"—reads slightly formal but remains plausible for a man in extremis. Filter verbs ("understood," "saw," "realized") cluster in the climax without obscuring immediacy. One minor slip: "she knew her motive had been met" in the final paragraph edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the chronicler's professional precision and grief-driven focus. Diction is controlled ("chronicler of currents and spillways," "my own truth keeps slipping under like a stone") with purposeful compression. The imaginary inspector device ("alluding to an imaginary inspector beside me because I cannot bear to speak to myself directly") is voice-motivated but edges toward over-articulation. Psychic distance modulates appropriately under pressure (the accordion chord "sighs into the tiles, as if the room itself wants to forgive me").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with clear perceptual signature: "cautious exuberance," the habit of documenting because "his memory wandered like a sleepwalker," and selective attention to light, reversals, and silences. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression in phrases like "shelved with bottled dawn" and "timing itself by how long the glow took to reach his table." No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally (zooming out for the library's logic, tightening for his realization). Rhythm varies naturally, and the final line's present-tense shift ("the mist on his window glowed") serves closure without disrupting stance. Free indirect style is clean, and filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") fit the reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "green murmurs," "thirst and sap-rise," "mulberry ache." Diction remains character-particular ("velvet observatory breathed heat like a dark fruit," "careful bureaucratic language"). Free indirect blends smoothly ("everyone knew researchers read lies in documents"). The basil's sharp-sweet laugh and the figs' terror are embodied through sensation rather than explanation. Minor slip: "destiny here was perforated, full of little holes where choices leaked through" edges toward thematic summary, though it's anchored in the plants' sensations. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "beautician mortician" signals both profession and perceptual bias, and diction remains consistent ("lucidly watchful," "radiant hush"). Psychic distance is stable; we track Mara's interior sensory processing (the hum like "distant radio snow," the corridor of pale faces) without head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure—short, percussive clauses during the ritual, then longer cadences at closure. Minor slips include occasional filter stacks ("she believed," "she understood") that slightly dull immediacy in a few lines, but these do not obscure clarity or flatten the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited anchors cleanly to Mara; perceptual signature (listening to vineyard hush, noticing fermenting-foam clouds, feeling the hairpin's worn tip) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and elevated without breaking POV lexicon. Two slips: "rebirth was a duty, not a miracle" and "the cycle would carry what she tended" tilt toward explanatory summarization rather than letting the image work; and the mother's soundless speech ("spoke without sound") abstracts what could be embodied gesture. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—she decodes chimes, weighs unspoken doubts, filters the dawn through her professional lens. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional phrases ("cool smoke," "drink the dawn and breathe it back as questions") edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds vernacular grounding. The narrative stance is consistent, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is brief and goal-driven ("Bring this to the lantern room..."). One filter-verb cluster in the middle section ("understood," "felt," "saw") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: breath as confession, ripples as language, magnetism tasted. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during trance immersion, slightly withdrawn during exposition. Sato's dialogue carries pedagogical weight and resignation ("Do not ask what I found... questions make you loud"); the narrator's interior voice is lyric and attentive without slipping into diagnostic self-awareness. One brief filter-verb cluster appears mid-story ("I realized," "I felt," "I understood") but does not flatten immediacy during peak beats. The prose voice is consistent, and the elision of Sato's final vanishing is purposeful—it enacts the lesson of attention shifting—so the omission reads as taught compression rather than withheld convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is single, stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature: Oren notices sound lines, striations, overtones, and intervals—a musician's lens. Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-motivated ("harmonic stone skimmer," "pulse left wandering," "a map you could sing"). No dialogue. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean ("he knew the pulse had come near"). Purposeful compression in phrases like "femur pillar" and "dust memories" reads as intentional lyricism. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the humming sequence. One minor register note: "relationship between places, not a march" edges toward abstraction but stays within the focalizer's reflective capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Davin notices "inkless fingers," "brilliant dimness," and the "thumbprint of quartz" in character-specific ways. Diction modulates with pressure—short clauses during the harness drop, slower syntax in the terrace garden—and voice remains coherent under stress. No head-hopping. One friction: elevated register occasionally intrudes ("the sacred had been misfiled into a ledger," "the folly answered with silence, as if it recognized theft even in polite arithmetic") where plainer diction would sharpen immediacy, though these remain voice-plausible for a trained mage.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    The first-person voice maintains a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature: "the waterline looked stitched with small moons," "each creak of the ship signified a new hue." POV remains stable throughout the two-location structure, and the narrator's synesthetic filter is character-specific and purposeful. However, some constructions lean toward elevated diction that occasionally strains naturalism—"by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify" and "opened like a throat" feel slightly performative rather than urgent. The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses during the porthole moment), but a few filter verbs ("seemed to," "realized then why") dull immediacy at high-tension beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature ("quiet enthusiasm," treating static as backward syllables, seeing coins as permission) is character-particular and voice-consistent. Diction elevates purposefully in conceptual beats ("wavelength align with purpose," "distilled chord") without breaking her technical idiom. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during coin-casting and prophecy interpretation, slightly wider when observing crew reaction. Minor: "stellar doubt" as phrase risks over-literalizing the tone in "every hope into stellar doubt," but the rest avoids thematic echo. No dialogue present; interiority remains compressed and goal-driven under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctive and consistent: elevated diction ("bruised relics," "salt bright shards") remains stable throughout and reads as the reaper's perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled; the reaper's way of noticing privileges metaphysical connections over mundane detail. One minor register slip: "distant intimacies" in the final line edges toward abstraction, though it remains anchored in the concrete act of carrying. No dialogue present; interior voice maintains compression and purpose under accumulating pressure. The phrase "my footsteps keep distance from the lives I take" exemplifies voice as character.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single stable POV; diction is distinctive and control is maintained under pressure ("empty ribs," "cooled flame," "the sea decided to stop giving fish"). Evin's perceptual signature is mechanical and earnest: he counts intervals, believes the universe is less personal and more mechanical, interprets the silver ripple as "plausibility." Psychic distance tightens at key beats (the breath fogging the seam, the soft click). The steward's brief question and Evin's reply carry subtext (guild authority vs. cosmic bookkeeping). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the prose rhythm modulates—longer syntactic arcs in setup, shorter pulses at the ringing.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara's perceptual signature—cataloging, matching angles "like stitching," vigilant warden diction—is consistent and specific. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure ("the mirrored hush the valley keeps at dusk"). Two frictions lower the score: (1) the phrase "precisely humane" feels elevated beyond Mara's working register, and (2) some reflective beats lean toward expository summary ("That was the lie we lived in") rather than letting image carry the weight. Still, the prose voice is controlled and the final cadence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV is stable throughout with a consistent lyric-philosophical register. Perceptual signature is evident in descriptions like "dawn itself" and "moonlit wheat," anchored in Liora's alchemist-and-dreamer stance. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under pressure ("her hands shook") and broadens for reflection. The voice carries a distinct texture—elevated but legible, with purposeful compression in phrases like "a room she had always owned." However, some constructions skew slightly generic ("the touch of wonder in her chest like a door opening"), and the prose occasionally drifts toward explanatory summary rather than trusting dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices pauses, breath lengths, nicks on the buckle, and the smell of machine oil, all filtered through occupational expertise. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("cold metal parachute buckle," "slick trunk," "bound for judgment"), though some phrases trend lyric-elevated ("stone dropped into a deep well," "oath," "badge and warning") in ways that slightly exceed the watcher's working register under peak stress. No dialogue appears on the page to test naturalism or subtext. Psychic distance is controlled, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly formal register ("the clarity that sliced through pretense the way a blade parts fog") that suits the speculative setting, though some phrases ("empty drum," "rehearsed stories") edge toward stock metaphor. Internal thought remains clean with no head-hopping. The protagonist's perceptual signature—seeing pretense, feeling numbness—is consistent. Diction stays within a reflective, philosophical range, and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure, though peak moments (the paired motion, the final breath) could benefit from sharper sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Bram's narration is steeped in mechanical metaphor (conductor, baton, cue engines like strings) and sensory acuity (fuel stink sharp as memories, mist like autumn and detergent). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("mournfully eager," "grief has made his house airtight," "tending to the unspoken is like watering a plant you cannot see"). No dialogue, so those bullets are moot. The voice modulates effectively from quiet desperation to ritualistic intensity. One minor slip: "true haunting lives in those details" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization, though it stays within Bram's focalization. Psychic distance tightens during the tunnel work and opens slightly at home, serving the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("dimensionally homesick, the kind that aches for a street you have never seen"). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: compressed syntax when the pendant brightens, expansive when reflecting. The guardian's dialogue ("rasp that sounded like pages turned too fast") carries character-specific idiom. Minor weakness: some diction edges toward elevated register not fully earned by the narrator's established lexicon ("interiorizing exteriors," "wavelength" as metaphor). No head-hopping; elision of how they physically "turned attention inward" is purposeful compression that fits the dream logic taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is present ("stoically sensitive," "listening to tiny cries of metal"), though some phrases ("when the penny drops," "the place itself approved") momentarily drift toward external certainty. Diction is elevated and consistent, yet several constructions ("a soot masked in gray," "vivify the cooling alloy") feel lexically strained for the POV's urgency. Jun's dialogue is minimal but functional; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; diction is controlled and purposeful ("practical cadence of orbits," "blueprint for rebuilding"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices signal threads, tuning coils, and the difference between broadcasting and receiving. Minor register drift: "the sky lied unless you listened by discarding assumptions" reads slightly elevated for the established voice, and "arrogance" in "lighter by one arrogance" tilts abstract. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is appropriate; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with task pressure (short clauses during the mast drop, longer during the signal interpretation).

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lina; perceptual signature (checking lines, whistling, tracing patterns) is character-specific. The prose carries distinct texture: "resiliently positive habit," "time preferred to crab along the wharf," "engines sounded as if they were turning pages." Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear at key turns but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The dialogue is minimal (older self speaks "through a radio handset that buzzed without batteries"), functional, and goal-driven. Under peak stress (climbing back, radioing), syntax compresses appropriately without losing coherence. The recurring "permanent transient" phrase and "spectral grotto under starlight" read slightly elevated but remain consistent with the lyric-maritime register established early.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable first-person; distance modulates purposefully (close during fever/memory shifts, slightly elevated during installation description). Perceptual signature is distinct: "fever dream architect" filters detail through architectural and medical idiom ("proof lines," "texture of connection," "sutures"). Diction stays character-bound; "rational enchantment: spells that could be checked like math" and "smiles were also knots" feel voice-motivated. One minor slip: "the curator called it disturbing, but he smiled" lacks subtext in the dialogue itself (none is quoted), though the beat advances. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters detail through Mara's navigation expertise ("sonar echoes that died in silt storms," "chord on the wall," "radii"). Diction is controlled and specific ("basalt," "lattice of light," "petal arcs"), though occasional elevation ("balancedly curious," "foreclosing a path") nudges above natural register for crisis thought. No dialogue appears; Jae remains silent on the surface, a missed opportunity for voice distinction. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for the classroom demonstration and accelerating through the ascent. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices angles, curves, and geometric relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is consistent ("persistently curious," professional idiom). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Eli's silence and the phone's calm rain-voice carry subtext. The hearing aid's sensory cues (ticks, pulses, warmth) are filtered through Mara's tactile attention. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully when the orderly Jessa hands over the envelope. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon—"reeling hush," "fern shadows"—without register drift. Minor: "the woman's voice, calm as rain" and "sounded almost like relief" edge toward stock phrasing under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored in Mara's sensory bias (wet copper = Ken's voicemail; gold fleck crawl = invisible tug she cannot feel). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "slick rocks," "throat of stone," "tired animals," "white fog that made the passage feel less solid." Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, so subtext lives in action and image. The phrase "measuring the distance to daylight like a debt" and "terror crowded her ribs" demonstrate distinct perceptual signature and embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: Mara's counting metronome, the shard's warmth, and sensory focus (ink blooming, drives ticking, snow shifting) remain character-specific. Lyle's voice via speaker is indirect dialogue, thin but steady, with purposeful compression ("soul's interference," "fetch wisdom from failure"). Diction ("opal observatory," "sleeping spear," "dark lake bloom") is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated, and legible. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats. One elision (the employer-folder obstruction) is brief and paid off when Mara finds the email. Dialogue (Lyle's guidance) advances the ritual and thematic stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable distance; narrative certainty matches what an external observer plus Ilen's demonstrated knowledge can plausibly know. Diction is distinct and purpose-driven: "copper-veined storyteller," "towers of bone rose like ruined organs," "dry rasp...as though it had stored a hundred unspoken syllables." Perceptual signature is consistent—Ilen notices texture (chipped edge, grain, pressure) and sound-pattern (harmonics, distinct strands). Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("Years later...") accelerates to closure without detail-bloat. Minor slip: "their consonants softened, as if time was sanding them down" edges toward poetic summary where a concrete failed-speech moment would sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "the old grief people carried behind their teeth," hears the "soft extra tone that tugged at my ribs," and her voice modulates naturally from clinical researcher to someone who plants an arrowhead "as if nailing down a tent in a storm." Psychic distance is controlled; Mara infers Jonas's state without claiming certainty beyond her senses. The prose has rhythmic variety and the interior lexicon stays consistent, though some phrases ("gravitationally playful," "metamorphose...into a doorway") drift toward elevated diction that straddles Mara's voice and authorial framing. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Jonas's lines carry subtext and pursue goals.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lio; perceptual signature is distinct ("notes came out resonantly soft, as if velvet could file metal without sparks"). Diction remains consistent: "tarnished wonder," "guilty teeth," "hesitant, human stutter." No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("Lio felt his violin hand shake"). Rhythmic control evident in longer constructions that breathe with scene momentum. No dialogue to assess. Minor: "in the gap between knowing and understanding, when fear has a name but not yet a weight" reads slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, a brief register lift.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Ivo's respectful-rebellious stance. Diction is lyric but consistent ("brittle hush," "thin as a folded envelope"). Brief register elevations ("intercepted mail," "linking absences") fit the mailman's methodical voice. No dialogue is present. The bottle and Nela micro-moments ground perception. Some metaphoric density in opening lines ("cobalt arcade breathed") borders on decorative but does not obscure focalization. Perceptual signature (noting which houses stopped receiving post) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: silence registered as "pressure on the tongue," bells as "commas in a sentence he might finish," and the hush as tangible material. Diction remains within Rowan's lexical range (carpenter terms, physical perception). The phrase "inside that chime" and "whispering gleam" sustain a distinct rhythmic texture. Minor slip: "a secret route" and "ribcage" metaphors occasionally drift toward elevated figuration, but the effect remains voice-motivated and legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara hears books' pulses, treats the scarf "like a bookmark for the air," sees shelves "curve away, as if the stacks were the rim of a deeper bowl." Diction remains character-consistent ("sanely eccentric precision," "theorist's patience") and purposefully lyric without register drift. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally—close during the scarf-contact moment, pulling back slightly for the patron-guidance beats. The prose texture (nested clauses, appositive rhythm) reflects Mara's methodical, poetic mindset. Minor density: some lines ("its reading rooms nested like Russian dolls, its staircases bending in ways a carpenter would deny") edge toward decorative but remain voice-motivated and serve the hyperbolic-geometry premise. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through Mina's obsessive attention. Perceptual signature is consistent: light "skimmed off paper photographs," palette pans "filled with dawn-color," the dream as "luminous absence in the shape of someone she used to love." Diction matches the lyric-descriptive voice throughout—"hush of improbable beginnings," "wind languages no mainland ear could parse." The single dialogue line ("You wrote me back") fits the ethereal register and advances plot without breaking voice. Minor register drift: "vitalize the cipher" and "conceptual" feel slightly elevated against the more embodied texture of "salt-stiff hands" and "tingled like a lens," but remain within the narrator's idiom. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person POV is stable; distance and perceptual signature remain consistent (poetic, cosmically-inflected). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the narrator's stargazing sensibility. Dialogue with the locksmith ("words are only locks that pretend") carries subtext and ritual formality. Register remains high even in peak beats—"I felt improbable longing turn tangible" and "guarding the moment like a craftsman"—where simpler embodied syntax might heighten pressure. Psychic distance does not modulate meaningfully under stress; the voice remains poeticized rather than degrading or sharpening. Free indirect thought is clean, though the consistent elevation flattens urgency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance modulating purposefully—close during the dive, more reflective in backstory. Diction reflects Lissa's folklorist lens: "chronically curious," "detecting folklore," "cataloged." The sentence rhythm varies, and the compression ("decades of blankness folded back as if someone returned a stolen quilt") is evocative. However, some constructions feel elevated beyond the moment's urgency: "she realized the ring was not a warning but a latch, grown up around the place where her nineteen-year-old self had stepped unasked" reads more writerly than immediate. Filter verbs ("felt her own habits crack," "saw the greenhouse roof painted") are acceptable but cluster in key beats without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Lio with tight access to his nervousness and his reading of Mara. Diction is purposeful and voice-particular ("combative tenderness," "shard-mirror archivist," "pride makes its own key"), though occasional elevated phrasing ("the spell behind them survives") edges into lyric register that risks distance drift. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Lio's "you must also learn which words spit back" and Mara's snarl that "writing will not feed her" carry subtext and advance the conflict. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable. Minor deduction for a few filter verbs ("he notices her fingers shake") and one moment of summary exposition ("His job as archivist is to catalog...") that flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance and a lyric, inventive diction ("verdant parapet," "thoughts had been bottled," "drew it in the air"). Voice reflects the narrator's creative identity through metaphor and sensory particularity. Minor issues: "insatiably creative" is a label rather than shown through prior action; the narrator's perceptual signature is consistent but occasionally slips into elevated register ("radiant hush that made secrets feel safe") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Free indirect handling of Soren's teaching is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (the protagonist notices masks, knots, sound). Narrative distance modulates purposefully under pressure (close during knot-work, slightly elevated during the ancestor's appearance). Diction fits the restorer's craft idiom ("porcelain and resin," "stitching the storm-spirit's breath"). Two voice slips: "lucid unrest" in paragraph 12 reads as externally imposed descriptor rather than character-filtered perception, and "across sharing a secret" (used twice) is a non-idiomatic construction that disrupts the otherwise grounded voice. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one moment ("their lucid unrest made my vision sharp") straddles uncertain psychic distance. Rhythm under pressure is controlled, with sentence length varying to match urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Lena's perceptual signature—reading travelers from map creases, tracing lines "until it stopped," imagining consent—is consistent and distinct. Syntax and diction are controlled, though rhythmic variation is modest. However, two friction points lower the score: (1) "a wish to interpret silence with empathy" in the opening is prompt-echo phrasing that feels inserted rather than voice-organic, and (2) elevated register in reflection ("methodically curious," "guarded kindness shift into an openness she could still shield from superstition") drifts toward essayistic summary rather than embodied thought under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are not assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "I am, by temperament, quietly analytic" establishes the perceptual signature, and diction remains consistent (equations, physics, measurable pressure). The dialogue with Dee is clean and serves subtext ("Call me Dee" humanizes death without over-explaining). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean in the recording sequence. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (technical detail in calm moments, compressed perception during the reel discovery). One minor register drift: "the way silence has measurable pressure at forty meters" reads slightly elevated for urgent dive action but fits the analytic voice. Elision of Earhart's body discovery aftermath is purposeful and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and character-particular: Lio notices gear clicks, phosphor afterglow, wire loops, memory-chip warmth. Diction ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong melody," "routing") remains voice-motivated and specific. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Lio. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during encoding, slightly wider for the courtyard's listening stones). Minor density slip: "like a moth circling a lamp it could not touch" is vivid but slightly elevates register during a pressure beat without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Lysa; distance is controlled and modulates with pressure (tight during decryption, slightly wider during reflection on the captain). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices "the careful patience she used on cracked teacups" and "warmly inquisitive fingers," filtering the world through her servant's attentiveness. Syntax reflects her steady, methodical mind. Minor slips: "oddly calm" and "affectionate detachment" read slightly exterior to her focalization, and the phrase "the diary was becoming a ladder built out of light" risks metaphorical overreach that muddies immediate perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is clear in her professional gaze ("ragged anvil cloud," "backscatter haze") and grief-logic. Diction stays within her lexicon: "catenary," "wake turbulence," "vortices" read plausible for an aviation meteorologist. Purposeful compression in "quietly explosive" and "soft hiss that became an absence" serves the accumulative design. The single line of pilot dialogue advances plot without excess. Psychic distance tightens under crisis (the telescope drop) and opens at closure (the whispered name, the margin note). Minor slip: "as if empty air keeps sound the way a shell keeps sea" in the opening paragraph edges toward authorial lyricism slightly beyond Mara's established register, though it remains legible and does not obscure voice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens at key beats ("she felt the familiar limit," "realized the safe was not only to hide knowledge"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Liora notices posture, voice, hand habits, the foreman's boot rhythm, and translates visual indentations into fractal star patterns. Diction—"like tiny valleys and branching rivers," "the heightened stillness of a chapel that had forgotten its prayers"—is consistent and purposeful. Single line of dialogue is goal-driven and advances the scene. Minor pattern: several sentences open with prepositional phrases or conjunctions ("At the central desk," "In the book," "When footsteps"), but rhythm varies enough to avoid true template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lio with consistent focalization and perceptual bias toward maps, instruments, and patterns. Diction is controlled—"luminance trapped between wick and air," "sociable isolation"—and rhythm modulates with discovery's acceleration. However, some phrasing feels over-written: "starling murmurations" appears twice, "stranded luminance" three times without reweighting, and "the room finally felt populated" tells rather than shows. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") are present but not excessive. Voice is serviceable but lacks the hairline specificity required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (locksmith focus: "tools clinking," "smallest click," "teeth count her heartbeats"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond a locksmith's natural register under pressure—"hauntingly bright," "driftwood nostalgia," "saltwood"—creating slight register drift that distances from embodied voice. No dialogue to evaluate. The lyric compression is purposeful and legible, taught early, but the elevated vocabulary in peak beats (the gear-filing climax) prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance without head-hopping, and the voice carries a lyric texture ("brambled hope, scratched and snagging"). Psychic distance is consistent, and no mid-paragraph POV leakage occurs. However, the narration withholds the relay-well mechanics and the content of many chalk messages solely to compress exposition, and phrases like "translucent as mist yet steady as a lighthouse" drift into elevated register during a grounded discovery beat. The collective "we" flattens individual perceptual signature, making it difficult to distinguish the narrator's specific way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices "nested patterns," "bruised awe," and the puppet's "beautifully flawed" cracks. However, elevated diction pervades even peak beats ("vouchsafe," "depthless window," "transparent, merciful arcs"), creating register drift that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose reads more like lyric narration than Mara's lived idiom under stress. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (e.g., "beautifully flawed," "bruised awe") are taught early and paid off at closure, earning the experimental add-on tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "knotted branches and wind-bitten fruit," "frostless air," "offhandedly exact," "graceless beauty." POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Diction sustains the narrator's perceptual signature—precision as character trait ("forty-seven minutes," "seven right, two down, one back") and poetic compression ("stitched-on shadow," "tears steam"). Dialogue is spare and functional: Mara's plea, the protagonist's questions, the final exchange. Free indirect touches are clean. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between immediacy ("I kneel without kneeling") and reflection ("someone must keep the curse facing outward"). Under peak stress, syntax tightens without losing texture. Minor filter-verb reliance ("I listen to the labyrinth") but voice-motivated and non-intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Voice carries distinct texture: "symphonically minded habit," "scalloped rafts," "naming catalysts like instruments." Perceptual signature is chemist-filtered (shear lines, boundary conditions, microdomains), and the "See, you can leave a form behind" brother-voice memory feels plausibly recalled idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during foam-tracing, slightly elevated during the settlement summary. Minor weaknesses: "the pieces fall into place in her mind the way themes resolve in a slow movement" leans tell-heavy, and a few abstract phrases ("grief loosened enough to let curiosity in") drift from embodied perception. No head-hopping; quote mechanics are clean; the final shift to present-tense internal voice ("she believed her work could make...") reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the vendor notices "pattern of cloud vortices," "unprinted pauses," and sensory metaphors tied to blankness and edges. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("glimmering parole," "incise, not in paper but in absence"). Under peak stress (the incision moment), syntax tightens without losing internal texture. One brief elision—"my own past had been wiped so clean that even my name slid away"—is paid off when the final page leaves an address. No head-hopping, and the narrator's uncertainty about their own origin is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with tight sensory filter: "his tongue caught memories," "his palms itched with borrowed shame." Diction stays consistent ("sandpaper rough memories," "scrape you raw," "grind it down") with culinary vocabulary woven through emotional processing. Perceptual signature is character-specific: analyzing tidal pool formations, tasting air, treating memory like tough meat. One brief register wobble: "emotionally contagious through touch" reads slightly clinical for the established voice but recovers quickly. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and anchors perception through Mara's professional lens (librarian, cataloging hymns by constellation). Purposeful compression and elevated diction ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetically decisive") establish voice but occasionally drift into abstract, label-heavy register ("tender, vigorous decision") that flattens embodiment. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the multilingual call-and-response ("te escuchamos, wir hoeren dich") advances plot but lacks subtext. Perceptual signature is present (grain dust as incense, Nine's cadence matching warmups) but voice does not modulate under pressure—Mara's internal texture remains uniform from planning through climax.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Nira's perceptual signature ("helix-minded," counts of five, labeling memory shards). Diction is elevated and consistent ("quaking reverie," "chaotically precise," "slow rewiring of synapses"), though under peak pressure the register remains lofty rather than compressing. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw") are present but voice-motivated. The backstory insert (mother, miner, surgery) shifts briefly into past narration without a strong present anchor, creating mild distance drift. Voice is distinctive but risks convergence with prompt language ("synaptic plasticity," "lucid drills," "entangled memories") rather than fully character-particular idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature ("prism-minded") filtering world through light-sorting metaphors. Diction stays character-particular: "seeds of vigilance," "threshold effects," "clandestinely luminous." Psychic distance tightens during the spiral descent without head-hopping. The prose modulates with intensity—short clauses during threshold crossing, longer rhythm in the antechamber discovery—and maintains voice coherence under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("seemed," "realized") appear sparingly and serve comprehension without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is tactile and patient: "listen with her hands," "hovering palms," "faintest sensation of moving warmth." Diction fits her symphonic frame—"intervals," "score," "conducting"—without register drift. Syntax modulates with pressure: long, careful clauses during wire-work compress slightly at the hedgehog return. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The porcelain's coolness and the wire's quiver are embodied through her touch, not asserted. One minor slip: "though the grove remains intensely quiet" edges toward narrative summary where sensory absence could carry the point.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a distinct elevated register with purposeful compression ("posture of a man still teaching invisible students"). POV remains stable in tight third; Sable's perceptual signature filters the nexus through chess and pedagogy. Mera's brief dialogue carries goal and subtext without exposition. Some diction edges toward the ornate ("hopeful melancholy as the last pages of a book you cannot bear to finish"), and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy, but voice remains consistent and the register suits the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person close on Lio; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (tuning frequencies, naming silences) is character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("theatrical sincerity," "solidified silence") that feels authorial rather than Lio's lived lexicon under pressure. The prose performs sincerity rather than inhabiting it in some beats. Psychic distance is consistent, and the notebook entries integrate cleanly. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (reading the apology aloud). The voice modulates with emotional intensity but does not fully degrade under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all perception through Jun's olfactory and observational bias. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "wildflower hush," "reek… like a wave of graves and ripe pears," "matching her inhale to the branch's swing." Etsu's speech ("wisdom… ran like an undercurrent, doing its work unseen") is slightly more aphoristic than Jun's narration, creating mild distinction. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter in peak beats, and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure (the bloom scene tightens, the descent relaxes). Purposeful compression ("journalize her days") fits the character.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Lysa's perceptual signature (watching water, pilot attention to arches and orbits) is consistent and voice-particular. Diction—"whirling silence," "pale fingers," "coached to be strong"—carries lyric control without register drift. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she had learned," "she had dismissed") early on is acceptable as grounding. Compression intensifies at the climax (layered heartbeats, repeating patterns) without obscuring causality. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person investigator; distance controlled throughout. Diction is technical-professional with purposeful compression: "pressure waves met their inverse," "rapidly adapting sensor rig," "wind machine designed to hide the work." Perceptual signature is consistently procedural and observant. No head-hopping. Minor note: a few elevated constructions ("labyrinth of shipping containers," "collapse into nothing") approach ornamental register but remain within investigator idiom and do not obscure clarity under pressure. Elision is minimal and always resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic translation anchors every high-pressure beat ("greens tasting of mint," "copper sunrise"). Diction is elevated but voice-consistent, reflecting Lio's role as a Guild certifier with specialized sensory literacy. The single brief dialogue snippet from Maera ("confesses she carved the hush…") is reported rather than direct-quoted, maintaining Lio's narrative control. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary—"my task is to carry proof" feels more like prompt-echo than lived urgency—and the Council testimony is compressed into a single telling sentence ("let my synesthetic testimony be my argument") rather than dramatized perception under pressure. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the crisis (the hush clenches, Lio watches terror) and loosens for reflection, but the final paragraph's "keep time for the city" edges toward thematic declaration rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance; psychic access remains bound to Liora throughout. Diction matches her relic-keeper idiom: "lacquered case," "directional markers," "old tremor lines." The prose modulates under pressure: brief fragments at the crossing ("barely sound, a thread of air"), longer meditative phrases during reflection. No head-hopping, no filter-stack issues. The pilgrim's single line of indirect speech ("asked why she had trusted rules more than a living voice") carries clear subtext. Voice is distinct and purposeful without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice sustains a distinct lyric-fabulist register with purposeful compression ("between the vanishing stars, when the sky forgot whole constellations") and maintains psychic distance throughout. Kestrel's perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-tuned (borrowed personalities "like misregistered prints," the workshop "like a stone in deep water"). The stranger's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven; the brief exchange ("asking for a broadside...deliberate ambiguity") advances plot without exposition. One slip: "lucid turbulence" appears as a phrase-object rather than enacted rhythm in the fear-swap beat, slightly undercutting the claimed tonal effect.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Rook's perceptual signature (jittery motion, felt absence, attention to small impossibilities) colors every beat. Diction stays within his register—"coax wonder from the routine," "smuggling small impossibilities"—without jarring leaps. Brief dialogue from the lamplighter and Mara feels natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs ("he wondered," "he expected") appear but remain voice-consistent. Minor: the phrase "vibrating sympathetically" recurs near-identically in two different contexts (lamplighter, mountain iron) without variation, creating a template echo that slightly flattens rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable first-person, filtered through a narrator skeptical yet receptive ("I protested that no one could know that"). Perceptual signature is distinct: tracking "every fern needle under the arbor as if attention itself could anchor a soul," noticing Lio's boots "caked in river clay," the prism "small as a thumb." Diction modulates with emotional intensity—prose accelerates during the mirror flare ("The mirror flared, and in the shifted hush I heard her voice"), then slows into lyric retrospection at closure ("At night the prism caught moonlight and threw it across the ceiling in cold spectra"). Lio's dialogue-free mystic speech reads as filtered narration rather than direct quotes, maintaining voice control. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV (Yara) with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (thread, silence, resin light). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated. Deduction: the barracks scene ("a man had forgotten how to hope") briefly leaks into Jun's interiority without transition, violating POV modesty. Peak-stress compression is purposeful ("mouthed Jun's name without sound"), but several filter verbs ("felt years loosen," "watched seasons slide") dull immediacy in high-texture passages. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture (bruised fruit, windblown petals, sleeping eye). Psychic distance tightens during the descent and final choice. Register occasionally drifts upward ("asleep, crumbling like bread" is apt, but "bartered, traded between breath and stone" and "slice of his memory was taken" hover near explanatory summary rather than embodied perception). No dialogue on the page; the boulder's "slow grind" speech is reported rather than quoted, avoiding naturalism tests but also flattening a potential pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV remains stable in first-person with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping ("tongue could taste which choices had been taken elsewhere," "breathing, letting the sweet chemical bite define corridors"). Jalen's single speech ("you cut my anchor when you told them I was nowhere") carries goal-driven accusation, though brief. Diction stays consistent and profession-specific, and the psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the rhythmic control through longer sentences matches the narrator's deliberate, sensory-focused attention.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, third limited on Noah, with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: "every crate by weight, every wave by mood." Diction remains character-particular ("the dark made the lens gleam with an aching, drowned luminescence"), and the prose modulates under pressure (short clauses at peak beats: "come. And Maris joined him with a wrench"). Minor slip: the phrase "warmly observant habit was a kindness he never admitted to" reads slightly over-articulated for the established voice, edging toward authorial summary rather than Noah's self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic diction ("green spear," "liturgy of angles"), intimate idiom ("dropped coins… stamped with dates"), and selective focus on ritual and light. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during crisis (compressed syntax at the climax). However, elevated register ("congregants," "liturgy," "choreograph") pervades even high-pressure beats, reducing variability under stress. The mayor's brief dialogue is clean but generic. Purposeful lyricism is legible throughout, yet the uniformly ornate voice in both reflection and action moments slightly flattens urgency at the flood's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable; Maru's perceptual signature (dye-master noticing stains, color, bleed) filters consistently. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("iridescent caution," "sutures became honest scar"), though occasional phrases ("her name drew tales the way wet cloth draws indigo") feel slightly over-written for peak pressure. Eno's dialogue is minimal and functional; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "magnetize stories" and "plot hook" carry meta-narrative self-awareness that edges toward authorial intrusion rather than character-natural phrasing under the established lyric voice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the worker's perceptual signature (arithmetic of sadness, private hunger, chalk lines, paper envelopes) is consistent and specific. Diction—"moving ink," "breath-holding corridors," "mundane miracle"—is controlled and voice-particular. The prose remains in free indirect style with clean filter-verb use ("I realized," "I understood") that fits the reflective, methodical character. No head-hopping. The lyric compression in the middle third (moonlight stitching metal, dreams as flakes, the sapling absorbing grief) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. Mild register drift into elevated phrasing ("inextricable," "municipal instrument") in a few beats, but it reads voice-motivated for an educated maintenance worker with Rell's training.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping; focalization through Lysa is consistent and her perceptual signature (memory keeper carrying "lost yesterdays in pockets of paper bark") is distinct. Narrative distance modulates purposefully during the weaving sequence. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("bound release," "realms thinning like smoke," "mirrors of light caught each other") that flattens immediacy during peak beats. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marin as focalizer throughout, and the narration filters sensory detail through his empathetic lens ("a cough sound like a confession"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately when he "could map the stranger's panic." However, elevated diction—"enlarge tranquility," "Index of Unfinished Things," "nested paradoxes"—drifts into a formal register that clashes with the intimacy of his grief and solitude, especially in the opening and closing. Lysa's single line of dialogue ("she had tried to deliver it… and now the others would think she had betrayed them") reads as summary rather than natural speech. The perceptual signature (breath, listening, mapping emotion) is consistent, but the prose occasionally prioritizes concept over embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Mina; psychic distance tightens during the confession and planting beats. Perceptual signature is consistent: "creeping normality noticer" guides selective attention (streetlights shifted, patrols gained new badges). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You see what changes by inches...that makes you useful here"). Minor slip: "heuristically gentle, always testing what kindness might work" reads as authorial diagnosis rather than Mina's perception. Diction stays within Mina's register except for one line ("altars...uncloak") where the vocabulary elevates without clear internal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct and archival: "counted the tremble in their light the way one counts a heartbeat," "listened...with the fingertips of his mind." Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("quartz hush," "luminous vows"). No head-hopping. The elevated register is consistent with the character's profession and interiority. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—tighter during the slide's warming, wider at the window.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is character-specific (she notices engine-knock analogies, the drunk rigger's flirtation as opportunity, Strake's ring-tap as signal). Diction modulates with pressure: syntax compresses during the crawl among mussel shells, then expands at sunrise. The prose carries a distinct rhythmic texture ("lips moving but voices swallowed," "letting the tide rinse blood from the boards"). No head-hopping. Elision of the quartermaster's loyalty feels purposeful but borders on withholding for suspense. Strong control with minimal slips.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single first-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: taste-based sensing, luminous-patch recording, nostalgic interiority. The dialogue exchange with Thundercloud Hair feels functional but slightly expository ("the forests elect their councils by balancing water and charge"). Diction is consistent (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic gravity," "futurist ritual wearing an antique tenderness"), though some phrases approach elevated register without strain. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the convergence moment; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and Mara's perceptual signature—charcoal fingers, mnemonic rhythms, remembered diagrams—feels distinct. Diction stays consistent ("inescapable calling," "auroral sorrow") and psychic distance modulates purposefully at closure when reflection of her mother's songs and the cave's light merge. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("walls glitter like frozen music," "auroral sorrow, as if the crystals remember brighter colors") but the imagery remains tied to Mara's artist lens. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mara; perceptual signature is selective (she notices shine, torn fibers, Sable's responses). Diction remains consistent ("words people swallowed," "quiet demand for candor") and modulates under pressure without register drift. Two minor slips: "carried the scent of ink, ozone, and something like rain that the city no longer owned" leans slightly elevated for the moment, and the phrase "fear that telling her would invite thieves" in Lio's vellum reads as summary rather than Mara's interpretation of fragmented text. Dialogue with Archivist Rull is brief and functional; no voice-convergence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("whispering like cloth," "slow bleaching of wonder"). However, the diction occasionally drifts into explanatory abstraction ("the gray rules had been written by fear of the unknown colors") that flattens rather than charges. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific—the observations could belong to any sympathetic observer of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in N-3's perceptual signature: "thin inner static," "organic-grained fingers," "algorithms finally stopped arguing with the sky." Diction stays consistent—technical (compression vial, ceramic collar, vent protocol) blends with lyric compression (mulch "crawled," sparks "pinched," fears "named"). Purposeful elision compresses the burn sequence into "walked beside…pruning…pinching" without losing causality. Register holds under pressure; no head-hopping. Slight penalty: "fragmented wholeness, and he walked on" in the final line edges toward meta-commentary but remains within the caretaker's archival idiom. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person present tense remains stable and Mara's curatorial voice is consistent: discerning, patient, alive to small sounds. The courtyard residents' dialogue feels natural and goal-driven (Hassan's brother admission, Mrs. Ibarra's regret). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is strong—"sandstorm calm," the clink inside the mailbox—though some phrasings skew slightly elevated ("braid together like windblown sand").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lyra; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyrical texture—"counted time as a spider spins its web," "alarms slept under silt"—that fits the "lyrical code breaker" character. However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("encrypt vulnerability as strength," "calm defiance was the only dry thing she could breathe") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with the guardian) and functional. Perceptual signature is present (she hears meter in machine noise, sees rhythm in body movements) but could be more selective and biased in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person present anchors Lysa's perceptual signature: lantern-tender diction, maritime vocabulary, and a poetic register that fits her mother's gift of pressed flowers. Distance remains stable. Two frictions: "Old Maru taught me to read answers through patterns in coffee grounds" briefly shifts to past exposition without anchoring cue, and the phrase "the story of mercy" recurs as a thematic label rather than dramatized perception. Otherwise voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") and mostly consistent, though phrases like "data of it" and "private current" feel slightly out of register for a summoner in a mythic nocturnal setting. The perceptual signature—mapping silence, feeling ripples as data—is character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled but the prose occasionally tilts toward narrator commentary ("as if grateful that secrets could sometimes become mercy") rather than pure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV first-person voice is stable and idiosyncratic: "like the sky was being repaired," "patient as lichen," "the building settled with a long wooden sigh." Perceptual signature—reading lintels, hearing consonants in hinges—feels character-specific. Ilyas's dialogue ("time is the only verb a building understands") carries slight exposition but reads voice-motivated for a dead tutor. A few lines ("my grandmother's rolltop," "the inspector would have to grant heritage protection") tilt toward helpful-narrator clarity over discovery, slightly dulling immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV holds steady; diction ("charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant") is elevated but consistent, fitting Mira's aesthete filter. Perceptual signature is evident in the way light and sound are registered ("thin murmur that sounded like his laugh trapped in salt"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Sol's "clinical" explanation contrasts his "softened eyes," showing subtext. Two slips: "ghostly resolve" appears as both diegetic brother-voice and Mira's own stance without clear transition, and the phrase "demanded action" in the penultimate beat edges toward thesis-voice rather than Mira's thought.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds close to Liora throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: details filtered through her forger's eye (carvings, seam in basin) and grief (father's letter, thorn memory). Senn's dialogue ("Your penmanship...is our finest instrument") carries menace and subtext. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (studying carvings, noticing the seam). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediacy: "wisely enduring stillness," "unlink loyalty from conscience so cleanly," and "heritage rose thorn" read slightly formal for crisis perception. Dialogue mechanics are clean; voice is distinct but occasionally lapses into writerly register at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third on Lira; perceptual signature ("thin tremor like reed-blown melancholy") is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the mythic tone. Dialogue is sparse; Mael's brief exchange lacks subtext or goal-driven friction. Elision of Senn's rescue and the final reunion creates a momentum gap: the peak emotional beat is summarized ("among them Senn's true voice rose, faint but whole") rather than dramatized with embodied reaction or direct exchange. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the compressed ending flattens key intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance is consistent and tight to Mara's perception. Voice carries occupational idiom: "weaves truth carefully, translated only what she could confirm," "aligning distortions the way she aligned testimonies." Perceptual signature is selective—she notices forensic detail (the globe's slump, the heat required) and filters setting through professional lens. No head-hopping; the child's ghost communicates via image-pressure, not dialogue, maintaining POV modesty. Minor slip: "she suspected he had used the wreck as a furnace for his craft" reads slightly expository mid-paragraph, and the phrase "borrowed starlight" recurs in a way that edges toward authorial ornamentation rather than strict character perception. Dialogue is absent; no penalty applied there.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady through Jiro's and Ren's experiences across two nights; no head-hopping within paragraphs. Perceptual signature is consistent: craft-specific noticing (seams, knots, current lines). Diction is elevated but coherent, matching a philosopher's lens. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: Jiro's teaching through image rather than lecture, Ren's confessions. Minor register drift: "demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber," and "philosophy: you honor what cannot be seen" occasionally tilt ornamental, slowing immediacy without breaking voice. Psychic distance remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks flatten peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person investigative, with perceptual signature clear: the debunker reads land "the way a debunker reads a hoax, for what it tries to hide." Diction stays within professional-investigative register, though some phrases ("the storms were natural," "comfort line") lean slightly expository. Dialogue is sparse but functional: "The curse" / "The beacon" exchange lands subtext efficiently. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to investigative framing throughout. One voice slip: "made my hands go cold" is generic embodiment in an otherwise precise narrator. Sentence rhythm varies but occasional template stems appear ("I packed… then rode"; "I stepped… and felt"). Filter verbs ("I learned," "I saw") appear but remain voice-consistent for report-mode narration.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and poetic ("the sky seemed to speak, a chorus of lost captains"), with Eli's perceptual filter (builder's idiom, mystical technician) maintained throughout. Free indirect style is mostly clean. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that feels less character-particular and more authorial ("lyrically prophetic," "variant allegiance"), and some figurative constructions ("blue bruise," "guilty fireflies") feel slightly imposed. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The rhythm modulates with pressure, though peak moments (the broadcast scene) could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third limited, stable distance, perceptual signature: Sato's noticing is selective and metaphorical ("sea wind threaded," "jars like lanterns"). The prose has distinct texture—"penny poet," "feral loft," "gleaned redemption," "translator between generations"—with consistent diction tied to Sato's vagrant poet lens. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. One recurring issue: elevated diction in peak beats ("lonesome splendor," "positively wistful") reads slightly outside a vagrant's plausible lexicon without voice-motivated cues that this is Sato's interior idiom. Brief dialogue—the widow confesses, youths ask questions, elders answer—advances plot but is summarized rather than dramatized with distinct speech. The widow's confession is the only quoted moment, and it serves as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lio; perceptual signature is clear (he listens to vibrations, measures grief, calculates while feeling). Diction is elevated and poetic ("ribcage," "slice of sky," "blood into bandage") but remains consistent and voice-motivated, fitting a reflective engineer. The trader's glassy eye and whispered confession add texture. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("museum piece"). Distance control is clean, no head-hopping, and the final image ("one shared hum, fleshly ethereal") sustains the lyric register without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization stays with Irena throughout. Perceptual signature is clear: she reads horizons, tracks moon arcs, hears softening in machinery, and filters the viaduct through compass needles and lunar cadence. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "softly purposeful," "ancient impatience," "maps were her lever," "simple absence of obedience." The prose has distinct texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with urgency (the surge of impatience, the nights of charting). Psychic distance tightens at key moments ("for a moment her impatience surged") and widens for tactical reflection. Minor slip: a few phrases ("restrained wildness...like a wolf behind a half opened door") approach metaphor-heavy in adjacent lines, but they remain voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is clear (investigator counting details, mapping space by ear, fortifying emotion with facts). Narrative distance stays controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately—compressed when cataloging evidence, expansive when the entangled memories intrude. Minor deduction: the entangled-memory device occasionally blurs motivation legibility (are the memories hers or the lantern's?) without full dramatization of how she distinguishes them. Diction mostly fits Mara's professional register, though "voices telling her what conclusions to reach" and "lately the loudest voice belonged to her supervisor" reads slightly expository for a character under active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable through Elias's lens with brief, clean shifts to Lena's and Mrs. Halden's perspectives at section breaks. The prose carries a distinct, slightly formal register ("aptly deliberate," "vibrant hush") that fits a chaplain's sensibility. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, particularly Lena's question about what kind of heart needs mending and Mrs. Halden's final line. Minor voice convergence: some descriptive passages (e.g., "the way light breaks through storm clouds") recur in narrator voice rather than filtering distinctly through each character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinctive and sustained: "steadily curious, the kind of person who read warning labels for plot," "grinning at the acid sea, because even a silent bell can be a dare." Psychic distance remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping; Mara's perceptual signature filters setting through mechanical curiosity (kaleidoscope as wing-strut calibrator, gear paper for charting). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Jory's "So it finally chose you" and his admission feel slightly expository yet advance plot. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"transliterate," "algorithm," "yearning"—but remains voice-motivated given Mara's technical context. Minor rhythm stutter: "the etched marks clicked against the frame" and "the arrow-tip prow began to hum" share similar passive constructions in quick succession.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person narration is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices metadata slips "the way other people notice weather," describes servers as "a choir muffled by dust," and filters the archive through professional idiom ("checksum fragments," "raw audit trail," "corrupted thumbnails"). The retrospective frame is voice-motivated and consistent, compressing months of investigation into a single reflective arc that culminates in the morning walk into Legal. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close in the server room at midnight ("I slip into the Chute and pull back a veil"), more detached when summarizing the investigation's scope. Minor deduction: the line "I am brightly attentive, noticing the slips" reads as label-speak rather than demonstrated perception, and the phrase "singing its thin electrical lullaby" for the server room edges toward decorative diction that slightly inflates the register. The final beat—"I lie one last time"—maintains voice and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Mara's perceptual signature—she "felt an argument before any voice rose," "watched them in the weighted breath before reply"—and the prose texture (long, layered sentences; archaic "via glimpses") is consistent and purpose-driven. The phrase "courageous anomaly" and "reconstitute the old crystal ball by aligning the shard with the mirror-glimpses it awakened" edges toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds Mara's embodied register under pressure, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "my thoughts slid away as if my skull had lost its latch," "patience had a fold in it now." Diction remains consistent with the narrator's sensitivity (lyric but grounded), though occasional elevated register ("deliberate goodbyes," "borrowed tool") tests the upper edge of the voice under pressure. Signe's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot by reframing the narrator's pursuit. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. The final paragraph's compression ("windborne solace," "fold of my patience") is purposeful and taught by prior imagery, though it approaches the threshold of lyric density for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is stable, lyric, and voice-particular ("the estate kept an amber pavilion on the hill glowing like a held breath"), with sentence rhythm modulating for mood (short urgency: "I stopped"; longer reflection: the graft meditation). Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") in ways that feel imported from the prompt rather than organically sentinel-voiced, especially when contrasted with the grounded vineyard idiom elsewhere. Dialogue is spare but functional, and free-indirect control holds throughout. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Iri; POV modesty is consistent ("Iri sensed," "she recognized"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "measured kindness" read as local idiom without Wikipedia drift. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the prophet's "borders are where my clearings spill out of control" and Iri's silent "uncovered eye" reply carry subtext and advance plot. Filter verbs appear sparingly and fit the reflective register. Psychic distance remains stable. Minor slip: "the elders hired Iri" and backstory exposition in paragraph eleven slightly flatten momentum, though they anchor motive.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and Mara's perceptual signature: noticing "which hands shook and which jokes tried to cover the shaking," filtering the boiler memory through imagined metallic taste, and reading arcs as "the town's real map." Voice carries a lyric compression ("word traveled the way lavender scent travels") and purposeful diction (e.g., "earnest whimsy," "acid-free boxes") that remains character-appropriate. Mr. Gant's brief dialogue distinguishes his cadence ("memorial or trap") from Mara's softer phrasing. Narrative certainty stays within Mara's knowledge except for the brief omniscient claim "people came after supper… because looking hurt," which reads as inference rather than leak. Under peak stress (storm scene), syntax tightens without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent: formal, margin-dwelling, anchored in a scholar's perceptual filter. The "fractured sequences" structure is taught in the opening and maintained. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted ("weathered innocence," "suspended hush... you could lean on"). The apprentices' direct speech is minimal, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the reflective mode is purposeful, but the narrator's voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm—syntax is polished but not character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mira; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the rasp moment, wider during the search). Perceptual signature is specific: Mira notices the "wet halo" on statues, imagines her recorder filling with blank tape, hears gulls "soundlessly in her mind." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated phrasing ("tidal longing," "magnetic hush thick as fog") flirts with purple without crossing into opacity. Orrin's dialogue ("precognitively forgetful," "the garden hid a microphone that could hear time") carries fairy-tale register that fits the speculative frame. Minor deduction for a few filter-verb clusters ("she would answer," "she imagined," "she heard") that slightly dull immediacy in mid-passage beats, though the final image remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices gears, vibrations, and the Moon "bright as a scar," filtered through her repairer's expertise and grief. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, with no head-hopping. Diction ("luminous ache," "skittering around the dial like a trapped comet") is elevated but voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: the phrase "something as fleeting as sparks turned into data" briefly shifts into expository register, slightly loosening the embodied texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara with clear perceptual signature: she hears "the question beneath" professional codes, translates citrus and greenhouse air into hope, and her hymning method frames the action. Diction is mostly controlled—"hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness," "jagged as a shard of night"—but occasional phrases like "decisively kind way" and "suspended in sky" feel slightly elevated beyond Mara's embodied perception. Dialogue is minimal and functional: Jonah's "still remembers the song" and Elias's request feel natural. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the reunion. One slip: "the scent of hope from the garden vents seems to thicken, orange and green" anthropomorphizes the setting in a way that doesn't quite read as Mara's metaphor versus narrator convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; Liora's perceptual signature—scholarly, deliberate, attuned to runes and patterns—shapes all sensory filtering. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated ("haste had been the first loop that snapped," "knowledge returns by closing loops") without therapy-speak or register drift. Purposeful compression and lyric phrasing (e.g., "the air smelled of iron and cold tea") are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor deduction: some exposition ("an instrument of sealed awakenings...") leans toward summary rather than dramatized discovery, though it remains anchored in Liora's present investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Rowan's perceptual signature (bone-setter's eye for joints, distrust of legends, yearning for facts that don't bruise) filters all detail. Diction stays within his register: "cleft in certainty," "wrong kind of familiar," "patient methods." The girl's dialogue—"I left it for you," "shrewdly innocent in its candor"—carries distinct voice without head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the jaw examination, pulled back for forensic analysis. Minor slip: "eyes bright as polished seeds" verges on ornamental in a pragmatic POV, though the image serves the uncanny effect.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature (Lio filters everything through star-watching metaphors and guilt-weighted physicality). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight during the polishing ritual, slightly wider during the communal teaching epilogue. Diction remains within Lio's lexicon—"zephyr bloom," "sealed ink"—though some phrases ("reflectively vibrant," "breathing line up with the waves") read slightly elevated for sustained crisis-state compression. The adult child's dialogue is functional but brief, limiting voice-distinction tests. Rhythm control is strong through turns, with sentence length varying to match pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature distinct (honeycomb-reading mother, drip-translation via resin memory), and diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—techie guilt filtered through botanical metaphor. Dialogue (Jun: "what I planned to do now") is terse and advances plot; the narrator's explanation is reported efficiently without transcript bloat. Psychic distance narrows under stress ("guarding my own trembling"), and the voice modulates from confessional urgency to quiet gratitude at closure. No head-hopping, no filter-stack artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance, perceptually filtered through Mara's watchfulness. Diction is consistent and textured ("chalky and pink," "tidewater moving backward," "erased drafts," "wind had teeth," "bank of broken metaphors"). The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: the opening is compressed and declarative, the nexus beats are layered and immersive, the ending slows into resonance ("swirling hush," "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). Purposeful compression and patterned cadence (the recurring "whisper," "hush," "closing pages") are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor: occasional filter-stack in high-pressure beats ("She understood then," "At the top, she laid") and a few near-repetitions in syntactic stems ("The first hope appeared," "More cameos drifted") create slight drag; a bit more varied sentence openings in the middle third would tighten the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person POV remains stable and the voice carries a lyric, fabulist register ("patient breath," "golden stories," "sap rose like applause") that fits the whimsical-tinkerer frame. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marn notices vine quivers, listens to wood, imagines living wires—but the prose occasionally drifts into committee voice ("the truest tools begin") and elevated abstractions ("dreams were where") that feel authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature (sap thud, wrist rhythm) filtering the crater world. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("flash-paper alchemist," "the intervals between her heartbeats") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially under pressure. The cartographer's arrival introduces a second presence without voice distinction (no dialogue), so the convergence test does not apply. Free indirect access to Eira's understanding ("she understood that her map would guide") leans tell-heavy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV is stable throughout; psychic distance is controlled and consistent. The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly archaic texture ("peripherally focused," "reverse-engineer the problem by reading surfaces") that suits Ivo's craft and reflective bent. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon—technical, observant, precise—without unmotivated register shifts. One line approaches over-articulation: "the uneasy gap between them" feels like authorial comment rather than Ivo's thought under pressure, but it does not break focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: "kelp reads tide," "constellations drowning," "whalebone reverie" establish a specific craft-and-natural-systems idiom. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The widow's brief dialogue ("fear of empty hands") feels natural and distinct. One slip: "boundarylessly trapped" is a coined term that reads slightly forced, though voice-motivated. Compression in the grotto beat maintains legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "grief had made her hauntingly practical," "time was always measured in cues and breath holds." Diction is consistent—circus-trained precision mixed with lyric compression ("rain stitched," "rust hued")—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Minor slip: "both things that were here and gone in the same breath" and similar phrases occasionally edge toward writerly intrusion, but the voice remains coherent. No dialogue to evaluate. Elision (Jory's death summarized, accident details compressed) is purposeful and charges the present work.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyrically controlled: "yesterday arrives as a smell and tomorrow as a bruise," "the horses settle as if released from holding their breath." POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and scavenger-tuned. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chronologically confused," "eroded into this careful scavenging," "fractured stillness") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. The voice reads as authorial lyricism rather than Mara's internal idiom, and under peak stress (the ghost encounter) the prose maintains the same ornate texture instead of compressing or shifting. No dialogue to judge. The final image is strong but the register mismatch and lack of rhythmic modulation under pressure cap the score in the high-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lina's engineering lens consistent: "flow diagrams that treated people like water," "equations drawn in steel and paint." Perceptual signature is character-specific (load paths, drainage plans, angles). Diction occasionally stretches toward lyric register ("resurrect, because the place needed more than function to breathe") but remains anchored in her voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance controlled, free indirect clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I spoke to gears more easily than to men," "not sound, and still it met me where sound used to live." Diction remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon—clock-scribe idiom mixed with restrained lyricism. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. One minor register slip: "loosening memories of my father's workshop and its brass dust" is slightly elevated for peak emotion, but the texture recovers immediately. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("the hidden sunrise finally showed itself, a thin line of fire that did not crack the silence, only colored it") heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, maintaining Mara's perceptual lens with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct, lyric texture ("shadows always confess after the fact," "serene upheaval ran through her as gently as current") that modulates under pressure. The prose remains within Mara's investigative idiom, though some constructions—"trained her instincts the way divers trained their lungs"—feel slightly elevated for peak action moments. No dialogue on the page; the bargeman's admission is reported rather than dramatized, which limits voice contrast but preserves focalization. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Lio throughout; no head-hopping occurs. Diction is elevated and lyric ("oceanic hush," "quiet argument between order and drift"), consistent with a philosophical collector's perceptual filter. Dialogue is minimal and functional: Mara's line about weavers "not found by asking" and the weaver's explanation both advance plot and carry subtext about secrecy. Perceptual signature is present (Lio reads tools and ropes as texts, listens to water "thinking aloud"), yet the register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("methods survived when bound to a living cycle") that feels more authorial than character-bound under stress. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks mar momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable, single first-person, with perceptual signature evident in metaphors like "dark lantern," "loom remembering the tension," and "wet stones under moonlight." The queen's single line of dialogue—describing the boy's habit—carries subtext and specificity, though more exchange would test voice distinction. Diction remains elevated throughout ("lonesome splendor," "sorrowful perfume," "borrowed breath") without modulating under peak pressure; the rhythm is lyric-consistent but does not tighten when the projection forms. Free indirect style for the queen's interiority is absent, appropriately, as the narrator cannot access it.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Lorian's "habit of hypothesizing about everything." Perceptual signature is consistent: reverie, metaphor, a prince who steadies himself with sound. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("quaking reverie turned every creak into prophecy") that feels slightly imposed rather than earned by the character's mind under stress. The nun and automata lack distinct speech patterns; no dialogue appears to test voice differentiation. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he reasoned") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (firefighter's trained attention to smoke, wind, tremors in voice). Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice carries occupational idiom ("dispatch," "engine," "packs and shovels," "trauma shears") without Wikipedia intrusion. Two slips reduce the score: (1) The phrase "gracefully alert in every gust" in paragraph two reads as external rather than self-perception, an elevated register the narrator would not naturally apply to herself mid-crisis. (2) Filter verbs ("I saw my father in his face," "I told her") are acceptable but cluster in the rescue sequence without voice-motivated purpose. The dialogue with the girl is brief and goal-driven, though her question "how a scar sings" is slightly too articulate for someone in acute pain. No head-hopping or tense drift; rhythm modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience," "defiant hush"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices pipes, valves, hairline gaps—but diction occasionally drifts into lyric elevation ("eyelid," "rehearsing") that reads more authorial than character-bound under stress. The climactic beat's interiority ("stopped pushing and listened to the room") relies on atmospheric patience rather than embodied micro-choice, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lior; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries distinct texture ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "believing light could be learned"). Perceptual signature is selective: he "felt each fall as a memory," reads "return notes in his bones," recognizes "the old pattern" in his breath's echo. Diction stays within the focalizer's register—elevated but consistent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Minor density slip: "repeating families, repeating errors" and the phrase "the quiet sigh of falling petals" recurs three times, the third instance ("Across the quiet sigh of falling petals, the Garden watched their first wheel glow") feeling slightly over-planted rather than earned reprise, though it does charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering greenhouse visits and stone tracings through Jonas's perspective. Diction ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") establishes a contemplative register consistent with a craftsman-philosopher. The spectral encounter avoids horror tropes, maintaining tonal coherence. However, voice flattens under pressure: Jonas "centered his breathing" reads generic, and the siblings' dinner dialogue is absent—they "traded favorite poems" in summary rather than distinct speech. Perceptual signature (limestone dust, chisel hesitations) is present but could sharpen under emotional load. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance; perceptual signature filters the world through mechanical precision ("tooth of the gear," "latch in the chain assembly clicked"). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "cooled forge," "guilt makes even duty hesitate," "surf gnawing the ridge." Minor density issue: the phrase "searing reverie" in the flashback moment edges toward elevated register that slightly tensions the established voice, and the final paragraph's "she felt a small, painful easing in her ribs" + "she recognized the only justice she could offer" doubles the interiority beat. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (counting graves, listening for echoes) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction ("velveteen gloom," "arguments" of chess pieces, "statue rubbed warm") is controlled and purpose-driven. Small slips: "uncharted echoes" appears three times as a label without evolving texture, and Alvera's dialogue ("was it love or fear?") shifts into more abstract register than her earlier concrete speech. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Jora with a consistent elevated register ("ink had not yet met paper," "silence of the spire press her into clarity"). Perceptual signature is present—she notices wind cuts, counts lights, feels numbers "like bones warmed in her pocket"—but the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("small machine of meaning," "map of the future made from present facts") that reads more authorial than character-bound. The Warden's brief dialogue feels functional but underdeveloped; his objection and capitulation arrive quickly without subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately from reflective setup to focused action at the writing beat. Template-stem repetition appears in the middle third ("she overlaid," "she set," "she dipped," "she showed"), creating mild cadence monotony that nudges the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person close on Mara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "soot drifted like snow," "dust at their boots shimmered," "threads that curled around the musicians." Perceptual signature is selective—Mara notices luminosity, notation, and the orchestra's response—yet the voice occasionally slides into elevated diction ("contraband narrative," "Censors of Noise") that reads slightly above a working copyist's internal lexicon under stress. Dialogue is absent; all character interaction is summarized ("Vell explained"), which flattens potential subtext and limits voice distinction between Mara and Vell.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira with consistent perceptual bias (professional attention to clues, distrust of safety). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("trade as a charcoal portrait ash scatterer" is compressed but legible). However, several lines slip into elevated diction that strains Lira's lexicon under pressure: "stubborn way of letting the dead testify," "somber marvel," "consensus reality" phrasing in the inspector's moment. The dialogue ("it was an exercise in vanishing points") reads slightly expository. Psychic distance widens at the inspector's recognition without clear filter, creating a brief POV leak.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent—"abrasive calm," "speaking to himself…reciting arguments against forgetting as if they were prayers"—and the focalization remains stable in Orin's philosophical filter. Purposeful compression in the sediment-boring sequence maintains momentum. One persistent friction: several lines lean toward essay register ("competing narratives," "communal arts," "methods that once kept sailors alive") that, while in character for a wannabe philosopher, occasionally drift into prompt-echo rather than dramatized thought. The final beat recovers with concrete action (building the rig), but mid-story the diction hovers near thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("windows breathed cold," "echoes remember what people practiced"), elevated diction that fits Mara's choir-teacher idiom, and purposeful metaphor (rosette as eye, braid as unity). POV remains stable in third-limited, with no head-hopping; the councilman's interiority in the final beat is narrated as external observation ("looked down, as if") rather than true access. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("We will find the song by subtracting noise"); the roll call and sustained notes function as performative speech that advances plot. One minor slip: "practiced there" in "echoes remember what people practiced there" briefly wobbles between literal and figurative, but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly throughout with no head-hopping; Mira's perceptual signature (chef's taste memories, grandmother's wisdom, listening to measure change "the way she measured salt") is distinct and purposeful. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("synaptic plasticity," "once-in-a-lifetime crossing") that reads expository rather than voice-rooted, though the context (botanist's memory) partially motivates it. Psychic distance is stable; free indirect blends smoothly. Dialogue is minimal (whispered jokes to branches) and voice-appropriate. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the alignment and opening at closure. Filter verbs are light; thought formatting is consistent. The prose texture is specific and controlled under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV is stable and controlled; Maro's perceptual signature (toll keeper noticing coins, ration cards, cable lines) is consistent. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure ("my throat tightened"). The involuntary-truth trait drives dialogue choices without head-hopping. Dialogue with Sela is natural, goal-driven, and advances plot ("her assumption insulted my craft"). Psychic distance holds; no filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "I tried to comfort her, but the involuntarily truthful part of me revealed" slightly externalizes the trait rather than embodying it in real-time speech.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "the hour when the streetlights daydream," "a shard of hush slid into her palm," "arranging kindling for a fire that made no smoke." POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Mara notices squeaks, wall-scars, objects yearning). Diction remains within her sensory-metaphoric register under pressure. Minor: a few constructions edge toward elevated literariness ("compact quiet that burned gently," "hushed blaze") that slightly exceed vernacular grounding, but the pattern is taught early and serves the accumulative lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, Ilyan's focalization is stable and controlled. Diction is elevated but consistent: "salt roses," "foxglove-stained glass," "bruised twilight," "animate the lifeless city." The Founder's telepathic voice enters as "calm pressure of deep water" and is rendered distinctly from Ilyan's embodied narration. Perceptual signature is character-specific: legal testimony replays in his head, righteous anger colors his lens. No head-hopping, and the prose texture (formal, slightly archaic) matches the underwater ruin setting and Ilyan's role as truth-teller. Purposeful compression in the revelation cascade maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent mathematical/philosophical register: "numbers were my lockpicks," "proofs allowed." Diction remains character-particular under pressure, though "balancedly daring" feels slightly forced. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—filtering experience through equations and geometry—is distinct. The rhythm modulates effectively, tightening at the proof-by-contradiction and opening at the final sitting. Free indirect style is clean, and elision (the night with Mara) is purposeful, charging the present without demanding full backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mira as focalizer; psychic distance contracts appropriately when Ro's memory surfaces ("his shoulders rose as if his lungs had found a cleaner pocket of air"). Diction ("methodically hopeful," "hinge she needed," "sealed envelope") is purposeful but occasionally slips toward elevated register ("crescent shells," "rouse daydreams") that reads more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse and functional—Ro asks about graffiti, Mira explains, Ro whispers the next line—without strong subtext or distinct idiom between speakers. The perceptual signature (moonlight, saffron, crescent strokes) is consistent but not idiosyncratic enough to feel irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Maris with consistent psychic distance and vocabulary. The perceptual signature is strong—"green circle," "sweet dread," "gold leaf under mildew"—and diction remains character-specific. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated, writerly phrases ("monumental curtain of water," "consensus reality") that sit uneasily with the urgent present. The refugees remain voiceless; no dialogue tests naturalism or distinction. Internal voice is coherent but not always compressed under peak stress, and some filter verbs ("watched," "saw") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited, stable and consistent. Perceptual signature is precise and character-specific: clockmaker vocabulary ("escapements," "gear key"), counter-clockwise obsession filtering perception. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("weed-dark water," "bleak exhilaration"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the puzzle-solving and the stone's activation. Free indirect style is clean. Minor deduction: "he understood that meant when the light was lowest" slightly over-explains what the prior line already implies, reducing trust in dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person, psychic distance consistent. Perceptual signature is gothic-lyric: "moonlight filtered through spoiled milk," "repulsive allure." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unbosom," "cognizant paradoxical notes") that strains the voice's natural lexicon under peak stress. The advisor's whisper is well-staged ("hissed from a cracked clown mouth"), but its speech ("Keep your eyes soft, and keep the clasp close") reads slightly generic. Internal syntax remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Elision is purposeful (what the resuscitation entailed) and does not withhold known stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited anchored to Leeward; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-technical register: "the sea still held the day in its throat," "sketched resonance," "fractal generating a score." Diction is controlled and purposeful. However, several phrases veer toward elevated abstraction that strains the character's plausible lexicon in peak moments: "restless euphony," "dubbing the map in sound," "trading the beat with distant gulls." Filter verbs ("listening for," "watching," "believing") cluster in the opening without harming immediacy. Minor convergence: the crew's collective voice is not individuated, though they remain ensemble rather than distinct speakers.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with Lira's perceptual signature (cartographic pattern-reading, "spiral-shell cartographer" idiom). Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring clarity: "salt light," "bowl and rim," "burnt petals." Psychic distance tightens at closure. One register slip: "sunwashed dread" in the penultimate sentence reads slightly elevated for peak pressure, though it fits the established tone. No head-hopping, no dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean; narrative certainty matches Lira's inference ("realizes," "understands") without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (historian's eye for "marginal notes," archive details) but could be more distinctive under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Hadrin's "practiced sigh" and "protect people" carry subtext; Mara's request to read aloud dramatizes confrontation. "Fictional on paper yet stubbornly real" is a clever touch but slightly obscure on first pass. Register is consistent; no filter-verb stacks or expository clutter. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, with Lira's perceptual signature evident in her professional lens ("rule and plumb line") layered with personal sensitivity. Diction is mostly character-appropriate, though phrases like "interlaced absence" and "hushed blaze" occasionally elevate into lyric register that sits slightly above her surveyor idiom under stress. The single line of dialogue from Beran—"the survey is complete"—feels functional but generic. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the confrontation when "she pivots and shoves his skiff into a pillar." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly during action beats and breathes during reflective moments, though some mid-paragraph clause stacking could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is character-specific ("let the darkness settle...so my thoughts would not chase fear"). Diction remains controlled and purposeful, with lexicon appropriate to an indexer ("tranquilly perceptive," "alternative hypothesis," "receipts for the stolen registry"). Minor slip: "dappled resolve" and "a new lantern inside" tilt slightly elevated without dramatic cost anchoring them in the immediate physical moment, though they remain voice-consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady throughout; no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, compressed register consistent with the fantastical milieu: "kettles sing," "shadow tore loose and slid away," "stairway that descends while ascending." Psychic distance narrows during the climax ("she feels herself split into flame and paper") without filter clutter. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that sits slightly above embodied urgency: "luminous torment in sound," "stained dawn," "lightless light." These phrases are evocative but risk ornament over precision. The priests' dialogue is minimal and functional; Mira's interiority is present but could modulate more under peak stress (the split and the weeping are asserted rather than rendered through fragmenting syntax or sensory breakdown). No POV leaks, but the voice lacks a second gear of intensity at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is dense, technical, and haunted—"intangibly tangible, like holding smoke that still weighs your palm"—with a perceptual signature (sensor metaphors, physics diction) that feels integral to the traumatized engineer narrator. POV remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is tight, filtering the observatory's machinery and the geode's facets through grief and precision. However, some phrases ("the agencies that built the drones later hired me for my refusal to look away") lean toward exposition that tells rather than showing the hiring through a dramatized beat, and occasional constructions ("letting the disturbance teach me") edge toward abstraction rather than lived perception under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited through Mara; POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice has a distinct texture: "chain sounded like punctuation," "sky wrote its own routes," "brilliant dimness seemed to brighten from within." Psychic distance is controlled and the narrative stance modulates with discovery beats. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("why he had walked so far" / "frequency of belonging"); the pilgrim's speech carries subtext (tired smile, evasive metaphor). Minor issues: some diction edges toward elevated register not fully anchored in Mara's professional idiom ("perpetually surprised face" as descriptor, "shy comet" simile), and a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") could be tightened, though they don't obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Mara throughout. Perceptual signature is present (genealogist's tracing lens, guilt-colored observations) and diction elevates consistently ("bruised ink," "sieved hush," "tempered regret"). Jonah's brief dialogue ("if she could promise it would not hurt," "faint ticking in his dreams") carries goal and subtext. However, the elevated register persists even under peak pressure—Mara "felt her practiced scripts crumble" rather than showing the crumble through stammering or silence—and the prose remains at one lyric distance throughout, which flattens urgency at the confession beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Lena's perceptual signature filters weather as breath, commanders as "weather," and the crack as boundary that "burned." Diction stays consistent—"furrowed hush," "chains chimed softly," "jaw worked like he was swallowing a stone"—with purposeful compression that fits the tense parapet meeting. Dialogue is spare and subtext-driven: Vek's rough "the boy's mother was alive" and Sarin's muttered field-excuse both pursue goals (deflect blame, humanize loss) without exposition. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during compass handling, wider during paddle). Theo's perceptual signature—nautical idiom, guilt-filtered detail—is consistent. Lita's dialogue is functional but brief; her voice lacks distinct idiom. Two instances of filter stacking ("he felt," "he realized") slightly dull immediacy in mid-beats. The phrase "merrily melancholic" recurs as direct narration rather than emerging from Theo's lexicon, creating minor register drift. Rhythm varies purposefully; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "delicately robust," "ozone and second chances," "bruise you keep pressing." Diction modulates between hard-boiled compression ("a clean slate seeker with a dirty past") and lyric register ("the water itself was thinking"), sustaining the "jaded wonder" tone. The boy's thanking and wallet-offer show purposeful dialogue economy, and the time traveler's exposition serves plot without head-hopping. The voice stays consistent under pressure, though the final paragraph's philosophical turn ("empathy can be rebuilt word by word") briefly elevates register beyond the established noir-lyric blend without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scarred hands, beast-language whisper, hearing heartbeats woven through dark) but diction drifts toward elevated/poetic register ("paradoxically steady," "cosmic intimacy," "silver breath held over the world") that sometimes feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The prose modulates at key beats (bones loosen, skin thins to mist, voice deepens to chord) to reflect transformation. Filter verbs ("she feels," "she realizes") appear but are not stacked densely enough to flatten immediacy. No dialogue on page to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinctive: "onyx-ink cartomancer," "confusion were the only honest lullaby," "beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat." POV remains stable; psychic distance contracts under pressure ("Take it, take it, to the ceiling"). The diction occasionally elevates ("cloudbound repentance," "condensed sighs") but reads as the cartomancer's idiom rather than register drift. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice. One minor slip: "the mystery made me willingly perplexed" tells the attribute rather than embodying it in contradictory action, though the phrase recurs purposefully at closure to charge the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the hatch, wider in exposition). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "gravitationally lighter when happy," "ghostly resolve," "shadow work" as navigation metaphor. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices salt tracks, seams, the ship's recycled history. Minor slips: filter verbs ("feels," "watches") cluster in mid-story reflective beats without voice-motivated need, slightly dulling immediacy. Lio's brief dialogue ("why she never fought back") advances plot and revelation, but the exchange risks convenient timing; Mara's answer feels rehearsed rather than wrung from the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "orchestrates coincidences the way other people arrange flowers, by listening for the right hush" establishes a distinct perceptual signature. Toma's single line of dialogue ("the elders would call this omen proof") carries goal and subtext without clutter. Minor register drift: "turn hunger into giving and giving into heat" in the prophecy paragraph elevates into abstract phrasing that feels authorial rather than Amina's lived thought. Under peak stress (tremor, ash), sentence rhythm tightens appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct formal register ("calmly inventive by habit," "angles lived on the terrace"), but psychic distance is wide and declarative throughout, flattening immediacy under pressure. The narrator's perceptual signature—focus on mechanical detail and coded systems—is consistent, yet syntax and diction remain uniform across calm planning and peak action, missing the compression or rhythm shift expected during Captain Orven's arrival. Purposeful elision of how the spark pulse mechanically opens locks could be defended as mystery, but it withholds knowledge the narrator clearly possesses, reducing trust. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Eren's perceptual signature: he notices eels' turns, dust drift, rock ratios. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—calm during rock-placing, urgent when the sea opens. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. One friction: the diction occasionally elevates beyond Eren's hermit-on-a-bluff lexicon ("precognitive torment," "navigator from the far shelves") in ways that feel more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable first-person; distance modulates purposefully (close during the father's revelation, wider when describing the vigil's mechanics). Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices in metaphor (domes "wet as black pearls," second hand "like an insect"), filters setting through poetic and political awareness ("censored tongue," "bars of ink"). Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—elevated but not academic, charged but legible. Minor slip: "furiously tranquil" as a phrase recurs (Lysa's face, the narrator's mixed emotion) without enough variation, risking template cadence. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I realized," "I saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative voice carries a distinctive baroque texture ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos," "cymbal-like clash") that suits the pseudo-historical register. Psychic distance is consistent, and filter verbs are minimal. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Veller's "courtly words" and Lysander's etiquette-register challenge convey subtext and status dynamics. One slip: "the invitation carried the unspoken expectation" and similar constructions occasionally drift into summary over embodied perception, and the dense syntax occasionally obscures immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and consistent ("light had cracked and learned to sing," "shelves bent like ribs"), but the register is elevated and uniform across all beats, even moments of supposed urgency (riots, near-burning pamphlets). Len's "personality shifts" are claimed but not reflected in perceptual signature or syntax—May's "impatient personality" reads identical to prior months. Psychic distance remains stable, but the lack of modulation under pressure flattens emotional texture. Dialogue is absent, so no test there.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("wistful," "steely longing," "violet," "beaded on old posters") and consistent with the atmospheric, fabulist register. Perceptual signature is musician-specific: Lio hears patterns, understands compasses "by rhythm," and the piano strings hum in sympathy. Some constructions lean toward ornate literary phrasing ("the horizon invites night," "the station itself were trying to keep an appointment") that occasionally slows momentum. Filter verbs are sparse; psychic distance is controlled. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Free indirect style is clean when present. Overall, voice is distinct and purpose-driven, though density of figurative language in a few mid-beats could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and confident: "He did it in an empirically whimsical way: weighing shadows on a fish scale, timing prayers with a cracked stopwatch, and writing results in the margins of old songs." The perceptual signature is consistent—Tavo notices chalk marks, jar contents, and the tree's growth with a reality-checker's precision. The psychic distance is stable, and the diction ("luminous doubt," "borrowed legends," "surrendered certainty") matches the heightened-lyric register throughout. No head-hopping or filter clutter mars the flow, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately from skepticism to reluctant faith without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person; the protagonist's perceptual signature (ghost ship compass "cold as a coin," "cerulean regret," sea-glass hue) is distinct and consistent. Sera's dialogue—"you will diffuse the ache the way mist diffuses a hard shoreline"—carries her slow-spoken rhythm and role but risks elevated register that feels authored rather than spoken under pressure. The protagonist's diction occasionally drifts into lyric remove ("as if the tides of remembrance pulled it like the moon pulls water") that, while voice-motivated, can distance the reader from immediate stakes. Free indirect distance is controlled; the few brief reflections (father's disappearance, the severance) anchor in present stimuli (compass, ship). No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Mara’s scientific sensibility without slipping into dry exposition. Technical references (neutron stars, accretion, pulsar glitches) feel organic to her perception and are balanced by sensuous, concrete greenhouse detail.

Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, modulating between contemplative and observational without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)

The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and moments of heightened lyricism track emotional peaks.

The controlled, metaphor-aware voice is a major asset of the piece.

The narrative stance maintains close access to Orren’s embodied perceptions without awkward head-hopping, and Mara’s presence is conveyed through action, gesture, and slate-writing rather than unexplained interiority.

Psychic distance is steady and apt for a lyric piece, allowing both atmospheric description and clear tracking of present action. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and rhythmic modulation supports shifts from awe to strain to quiet relief.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture of quiet, observant authority that fits Amira and the communal focus. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and occasional omniscient touches (brief glimpses into others’ roles/feelings) feel like an extension of her leadership perspective rather than head-hopping.

The voice could risk slightly more idiosyncrasy or fracture under peak stress to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature—sensuous, metaphor-rich, oriented around optics and touch in ways that fit a camera artist and spiritual seeker.

The only ceiling here is that the voice, while excellent, doesn’t quite take a surprising or risky turn under peak pressure that would fully justify 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature: hearing colors, “jars of silence,” and the way sound is tasted chromatically.

POV control is tight—no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience—and the narrative distance modulates smoothly between atmospheric description and knife-edge interior moments (the radio hiss, the click). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and shaded by subtext, particularly Rell’s request and halting confession.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, with a confident, lyrical texture that matches the fantastical premise and maintains consistent psychic distance around Lio while occasionally shading toward your perspective without head-hopping. Diction (e.g., “golden-hour portrait thief,” “moonbeam script”) is distinctive and coherent with the world’s magic. Rhythmic control is strong, with long, sinuous sentences suiting the contemplative pressure without becoming unintelligible. At rare moments the lyricism risks uniformity of register, but not enough to blur viewpoint or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with Mara’s operatic narration and sensory attention shaping the prose. Shifts between her theatrical speech and quieter interiority are controlled and purposeful, culminating in the meaningful break when she stops narrating. Diction and rhythm feel character-specific rather than generic “literary” register. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the modulation at the end is especially strong.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with images that feel specific to Mara’s world (“moths…like shredded film,” “backlot,” “call sheets”). The modulation from numb horror to tense resolve is well handled, especially in the “trembling and certain” cadence at the end. There is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; all knowledge stays plausibly within her scope. The lyric compression feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature (mapping metaphors, attention to lines, coasts, and distances). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, accommodating both dense description and clear narrative movement without head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is elevated but feels organic to an obsessive court cartographer in a mythic setting. Under peak stress (storm hitting, booklet dissolving), the voice retains its texture without slipping into expository explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and cohesive, balancing lyrical phrasing with a machine’s procedural lens in a way that feels singular (“the academy had always treated impossibility as a work order”). Psychic distance shifts smoothly to accommodate description, reflection, and micro-choices without head-hopping or register jolts. The diction and metaphors are consistent with the hybrid sensibility of a sentient janitor—maintenance logs and safety codes alongside mystic incense and hymns. Under pressure, the voice retains its texture rather than flattening, which carries much of the story’s charm.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice through Mara is consistent, lyrical, and clearly biased by her quiet, observant nature. Syntax and diction carry a distinct texture—“borrowed from breath,” “maps and confessions at once”—without drifting into generic poeticism, and free-indirect access to her motives is clean. There is no dialogue to test, but the voiceless exchanges through drawings function as action and subtext. The narrative never over-explains; it trusts images and choices to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with diction that suits a pragmatic, aging gardener in a slightly fantastical bureaucracy (“the sort of man who saved string” anchors this beautifully). Sentences balance lyricism with clarity; metaphors (fractures like spider silk, maze blooming and withering at once) feel organic to the character’s sensibility. POV remains stable even as backstory is folded in, and Mera’s limited dialogue sounds distinct and functional. Rhythmic control supports the quiet build of the ritual night without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct, slightly lyrical yet grounded texture that fits a practical mechanic encountering exotic science. Diction and imagery (“a lung holding its breath,” “cold tea, familiar and strange”) are consistent and character-coherent rather than omnisciently florid. POV is stable on Mara, with Sen only accessed through observable behavior and speech. Rhythmic variation supports mood shifts—from hushed anticipation to conceptual awe—without slipping into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in a musician’s ear and a mourner’s attentiveness to silence and space. Syntax and rhythm modulate well with the emotional beats, especially around the dripping pipe and the held fermata at the door. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty stays within what Lena could plausibly perceive or infer in a haunted, heightened reality. A few especially dense sentences verge on ornamental, but they never fully obscure focalization or moment-to-moment clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with a scientifically trained yet fever-disoriented observer—technical terms (anemometer, radiosonde) sit comfortably beside metaphor (“ship sinking in snow,” “aurora spilled over the ridgeline”). Mara’s character is rendered through the narrator’s biased lens but maintains a clear perceptual signature as someone “peripherally aware,” and her dialogue is minimal yet calibrated, carrying subtext and pressure. The extended metaphoric register is steady without slipping into omniscient commentary or academic abstraction. Psychic distance stays controlled, with reflective passages anchored in present stimuli and no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinct texture—wry, sensory-rich, slightly sardonic (“I could hear my own eyelids click”)—that stays coherent under pressure. Diction and metaphor feel plausibly within this narrator’s lexicon, and the rhythmic control across long, sinuous sentences is strong without collapsing into purple excess. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the modulation from wry calm to charged poise at the end is smooth. A few metaphors come close to stylistic over-density, but they don’t materially harm clarity or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, cohesive, and stylistically distinctive, with a controlled, poetic register that feels appropriate for an archivist in a numinous library. Diction, metaphor, and rhythm are consistent from start to finish, and the single brief spoken exchange with the other keeper fits naturally within this lyrical frame. Psychic distance is well managed; we stay inside the keeper’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the slight unreliability (“gripped reality loosely”) is tonal rather than confusing. The cadence occasionally risks uniformity, but variation in sentence length and image keeps it from flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is steady and supple, with a clear perceptual signature in how Liora thinks in musical and tactile metaphors (“music as a handrail rather than a shove”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between reflective passages and the heightened eclipse scene without losing clarity. Diction stays coherent to the character and setting, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few lines drift toward essayistic abstraction, but they don’t meaningfully disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctly inflected by Lysa’s way of sensing the world—sentences feel like vibrations, walls hum, silence is "bronze dust." Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with long, sinuous lines that suit the meditative, accumulative mode without losing clarity. Diction is unified and appropriately elevated for a conceptual, mythic-feeling piece while still grounded in concrete objects and actions. There’s no POV slippage or over-helpful explaining; the narration trusts imagery to carry much of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with textured yet controlled lyricism (“as if she were accidentally prophetic and the universe kept checking her spelling”). POV stays cleanly with Lian’s perceptions and knowledge, and exposition is folded into her understanding of the world rather than feeling authorial. Rhythms vary effectively between more expansive description and tighter, action-focused sentences during the patrol sequence. A few elevated formulations nudge toward essayistic (“transpose life into a new key”) but they still fit her reflective sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong sonic and ritual register that suits a “loop pedal priest” and the concept of decorated silence. Syntax and rhythm vary with pressure, and figurative language feels coherent to the world (cloth over a bell, graphite voice, quiet as rewoven threads). POV stays effectively centered on Selo, with only mild omniscient shading that matches the fable-like tone. The rhetoric-focused narration never slips into bland exposition, and the devices named are mirrored by the prose’s own patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a distinct perceptual signature—attentive to pattern, reflection, and acoustics (“a whole orchestra implied in pressure changes”)—and it stays coherent throughout. Lyric density is high but controlled; syntax and rhythm modulate naturally, lingering where reflection matters and tightening at dawn. The speculative elements are filtered cleanly through her sensibility without head-hopping or stance drift. There’s a slight risk of uniform, high-register lyricism flattening dynamic range, but it never tips into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, poetic texture—“a darkening brightness,” “wet tracks of light”—that feels consistent with Lysa’s perceptual world as a gravity worker and time-bender. The narration balances lyricism with clarity, maintaining stable focalization and avoiding explanatory scaffolding. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentences stretching for lush description and tightening around rule-defining moments without losing coherence. Even without dialogue, the voice feels individualized rather than generic literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice through Mara is controlled and distinctive, with attention tuned to vibrations, pressure, and embodied perception rather than to sound—a strong perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, fitting the subject matter without slipping into self-conscious ornament. There’s no head-hopping; even Kerrin’s experience is relayed in a way consistent with what Mara can learn or infer. Occasionally the diction (“parasite of feeling,” “careful gardener”) feels slightly more authorial than character-filtered, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a controlled, observant cadence and a meteorologist’s lexicon that colors perception (“my breathing sounded like a barometer ticking,” “I read wind shifts”). Psychic distance is stable, and the narrative never cheats on knowledge or slips into expository committee-voice; everything flows through this character’s sensibility. Lyric touches are consistent with that sensibility and modulate appropriately as danger rises. At moments the prose approaches uniform lushness, but it remains coherent and character-rooted rather than generic or over-written.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and strongly flavored by Lio’s profession and obsessions: light, scent, and glass recur in ways that feel like his perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are elevated but coherent and consistent, with no POV leakage or unmotivated register jumps. Interior access deepens as pressure rises without expository over-explaining of what’s already clear in scene. The few explanatory lines about how the nose “summoned” memories still sound like his hard-won understanding rather than an author lecture, preserving voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with images like “highways hummed like tuning forks” and “laughing like wind chimes” feeling character-specific rather than generic-poetic. POV control is steady; we never leave the narrator’s perceptual frame, and reflective moves are anchored in physical cues (rope, grotto, drivers). Rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences and tighter, declarative closures to mark turns. The voice carries the speculative worldbuilding lightly, which is difficult at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, a close third that clearly rides Mara’s acoustic obsessions (sound metaphors, hearing “a trapped chorus of tiny clicks”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well—from quietly expansive description at the opening to more focused, almost incantatory lines during the unbinding—without slipping out of register. There’s no dialogue to test, but the nonverbal interaction with Jory and the restrained exposition of family lore both feel organic to this voice. Diction is elevated but coherent with a musician in a myth-tinged ruin-world; it never reads as academic or out of character.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, marrying sensory precision (“scorched orange peel,” “thirsty for meaning”) with a cool, professional cadence that suits a seasoned emotion dealer. POV distance and knowledge stay consistent: we never get interior access to Orin beyond what Mira can infer through static and observation. Metaphoric richness is integrated with her perceptual signature rather than feeling imposed, and the modulation from clinical to gently vulnerable near the end is smooth. A few phrases flirt with lushness, but they remain legible and voice-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled and gently lyrical, with a consistent perceptual bias toward work, logistics, and small acts (“money moved fastest when pushed by story”). Dialogue is spare but distinct and functional; Eli’s self-effacing relief contrasts with Mara’s composed practicality. The narrative distance stays stable, and the occasional figurative flourish matches the reflective, literary mode. It’s an appealing, confident voice, if not quite astonishing or risky enough for a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely aligned with Sava’s perceptual biases (attention to reeds, lattices, impressions). Diction and rhythm are controlled and distinctive without sliding into opacity, and sparse dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, distinguishing Ilya’s teasing practicality from the council’s clipped formality. Psychic distance is managed smoothly: the narration can zoom to conceptual statements but remains anchored in concrete perception. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge beyond Sava’s plausible inferences.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (Rin notices patterns, textures, and structure like an illustrator and amateur acoustician). Diction and rhythm are lyrical but controlled, matching the fantastical setting without slipping into pseudo-archaism or abstraction. Orren’s brief dialogue and behavior feel distinct and functional, showing his authority over time without exposition bloat. Psychic distance remains stable and legible even in more compressed, conceptual passages about music and time.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close-third voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly Lysa’s, with its fusion of conjuration, mathematics, and orchard imagery giving the piece a memorable perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, modulating between long, flowing lyric sentences and tighter beats when pressure rises (e.g., at the seam opening). There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift; even abstract terms like “probability” and “axiom” feel organic to her worldview. The voice could likely sustain a much longer piece at this level without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a close-third focalization through Lio’s sensibility (emphasis on scent, touch, infrastructure). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, giving the prose a distinctive musicality without sacrificing clarity. When the child or librarian appear, the POV remains firmly anchored in Lio’s perception and knowledge; there’s no leakage or unearned omniscience. The diction—“sapphire hush,” “sense memory was his truest lantern”—feels unified and character-compatible, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility (root tips, runoff, barometric pressure). Syntax and diction shift subtly with pressure—more tactile and bodily as the metamorphosis advances. Dialogue is minimal but effective, especially the boy’s question and her story-response, which fit the established narrative texture. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the prose feels like one coherent consciousness throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (infrastructure, weather, and art all noticed in the same breath). Syntax and diction feel plausibly the narrator’s while still operating at a literary register; phrases like “haggard awe” and “causeway still breathed” read intentional rather than ornamental. Mara’s spoken lines have a different cadence that suits her role and fatigue. There is slight risk of over-lyricism, but control and clarity are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent idiom that suits the mythic-fable mode (“air itself rang like a struck glass chord,” “cathedral of prisms,” “laughter swallowed in midnight”). POV operates as a controlled, lightly omniscient third person, dipping into Lan’s realizations and Sera’s understanding without head-hopping confusion. Rhythm and syntax modulate well—more incantatory around the cave, then quieter and plainer in the closing image of footsteps. A touch more individuated diction in how Sera versus Lan perceive the cave might deepen the perceptual signature, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with phrases like “ocean-spray archivist” and “navigated absences” establishing a distinctive conceptual lexicon. The narrative distance stays steady, moving smoothly between concrete external detail and lightly inflected reflection without head-hopping or register breaks. Rhythm and syntax are well controlled, with sentences modulating length to support both atmosphere and informational density. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, and when present it feels natural yet slightly heightened in a way that fits the overall tone.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in mapping, angles, and cracks that keeps even lyrical lines anchored in Mara’s worldview. Phrasing like “the hour that divides bad habits and new starts” feels slightly more aphoristic than her internal register but still plausible as her thought. Rhythm and syntax vary and support the dreamy yet purposeful tone of a midnight discovery. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the brief dialogue from the conductor fits the fable-like register.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility; phrases like “sympathetic skeptic” and “hold your grief like a lantern while insisting the dark was real” feel particular rather than generic. The narrative distance modulates smoothly, allowing occasional aphoristic turns without breaking POV plausibility. Even without much direct dialogue, each character’s presence and stance are clearly conveyed through diction and framing. The voice is rich but controlled, never sliding into explanatory omniscience or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism (“pressure change between angles,” “hallways began a spatial mutiny”) that feels consonant with an ancient, dimensionally-aware mind. POV remains cleanly anchored in Ilias, with Maris’s inner life inferred from action and speech rather than head-hopped. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (her tiredness, complicity) and advancing stakes. Rhythmic variation and image choice show confidence without sliding into self-consciousness or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person POV on Mara is consistent and well-controlled, with her perceptual habits (“ledger,” math metaphors) shaping diction and focus. The prose rhythm varies effectively between lyrical description and tighter, pressure-driven beats, and the narrative never over-explains what’s already dramatized. Dialogue is lean, purposeful, and distinct—especially Ivo’s glibness versus Sami’s quiet precision. A few elevated turns of phrase feel slightly more authorial than character-filtered, which keeps this fractionally below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on texture, craft, and time (“minutes had prisms hidden inside them”). Syntax varies, and metaphors are generally fresh and coherent; patterned phrasing like the repeated “by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn” reads as intentional ritual rather than a glitch. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative distance stays aligned with Haru’s sensibility. The voice is strong enough for elite venues, only slightly shy of extraordinary because it rarely modulates into truly surprising rhythmic turns under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textural, and consistent, with a distinctive perceptual signature (sound translated into touch; memory described as fabric and grain). Diction and rhythm balance lyricism with clarity, and the reflective distance feels appropriate for someone living in a liminal legal state. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; the slight formality of phrasing reads as part of his inward, observant nature rather than generic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and distinct, with a quietly wry, lyrical texture that matches Eli’s “gloomy cheerfulness.” Diction and rhythmic choices (“cheerful as a lantern in drizzle,” “seconds folded like paper”) feel character-inflected rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer for key realizations without head-hopping or stance confusion. The only small limitation is a relatively uniform lyric register that rarely roughens under peak pressure, which slightly flattens emotional spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct texture (“culture shock absorber,” “orderly intuitive,” “engines like teeth”) that feels native to this world. POV control is steady; we stay inside Ira’s frame of knowledge and bias, with no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but functional and subtext-bearing, especially in the bridge confrontation. Rhythms vary and the lyricism tightens under pressure, supporting rather than obscuring the core beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s perceptual biases (technical detail in the chemistry, attention to satellites and light), while never slipping into abstract sermonizing. Sentences have varied rhythm and a controlled music that supports the melancholy tone without tipping into purple. Dialogue is spare but distinct: Eli’s plain, resigned cadence contrasts with Mara’s more analytic responses, and subtext carries their shared awareness of endings. Psychic distance tightens and relaxes smoothly with emotional beats, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inclined, closely tracking Lio’s sensory priorities (sound, touch, light as heat) in a way that feels like a genuine perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; the prose modulates smoothly between atmospheric description and procedural repair without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural and pointed, revealing status and trust shifts without over-explaining. Courier and Sera’s voices aren’t sharply differentiated, but they’re present enough to avoid flattening the narrative into a single undifferentiated register.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and character-specific, blending professional lexicon (“singular convergence,” “atlas sheet”) with wry understatement (“which was a joke on both counts”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with varied sentence shapes and a measured lyricism that suits an introspective fieldworker. Reflective passages are clearly bounded by present cues and never break focalization or slip into an alien register. Under pressure, the voice maintains its texture without verbosity or explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct acoustic lexicon (“metronomes with tails,” “kiln chimed,” “dry fountain gave a wet note”) that feels unified rather than ornamental. The narrative distance is stable and apt for a quasi-mythic tale, offering enough specificity without breaking the fable-like register. POV is cleanly handled and free of head-hopping; when Mara appears, the voice still feels like a single, coherent storyteller. A few elevated phrasings verge on purple but remain controlled and pattern-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-colored, with strong rhythmic control (“stored stillness, a silence harvested from centuries of submerged worship and held like breath behind teeth”). Figurative language is rich but purposeful, aligning with a protagonist attuned to scent and ephemera, and the diction never drifts into an alien register for her. The narration manages time and interiority cleanly, compressing reflection without losing immediacy or confusing chronology. It only falls short of 9+ because the voice, while beautiful, is uniformly elevated; a slight modulation in texture under peak stress could sharpen both contrast and authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent in its metaphor-rich, slightly archaic diction that matches the fairy-tale-adjacent premise. Perceptual biases (sound, light, scuffs, hushed air) clearly belong to this character and reinforce his obsession. Lyric compression and patterned syntax are taught from the opening line and remain legible through closure. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modest distance allows both immediacy and reflective texture.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with striking turns of phrase (“the only warm lung left in the valley,” “bell under water”) that feel owned by this narrator. Lyricism and occult vocabulary fit the character’s craft and world and do not drift into generic poeticism. The bride’s few lines of dialogue have a distinct chill and tenderness that align with her described “lovingly venomous” quality. A couple of metaphor-rich passages verge on saturation but remain legible and purposeful rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled: it consistently filters the world through Ila’s weaving sensibility and Harbor Braid’s maritime imagery. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with long, sinuous sentences used for atmosphere and shorter clauses for key turns. The omniscient-leaning close third remains stable; there is no head-hopping or register drift. Metaphoric density is high but patterned and purposeful, contributing to a recognizable narrative texture rather than generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyric texture—“asking names for every stone,” “pages turning, as if the dead kept a library”—that feels rooted in Liora’s sensibility rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance is controlled and consistent, sliding smoothly between sensory observation and interior reflection without head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax are varied and responsive to pressure, with denser, more figurative passages in reflective beats and crisper lines around the tremor and excavation work. There are no noticeable register slips or explanatory overreach that break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, specific, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in occupational detail (“I am a pseudonym creator,” “when you know the calibration tables…”). Lyric touches are anchored in action and world logic, avoiding vague prettiness, and the modulation from quiet observation to focused problem-solving is smooth. Diction and rhythm feel plausibly tied to an intelligent, slightly romantic technician rather than a generic narrator. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; controlled compression supports the piece’s density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Liora’s sensibility—rich in pattern, textiles, and celestial mechanics. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, winding sentences that nonetheless remain legible; the prose modulates naturally into brisker beats under pressure (the lieutenant’s entrance). Dialogue is sparse but pointed and subtext-heavy, with Kest’s faux-scolding and Liora’s “singing planets” act carrying coded meaning and social maneuvering. There’s no POV leakage or register drift; the narrative certainty stays within what this character plausibly knows and infers.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses the occult with the emotional (e.g., roots as questions, healed stone as a “tongue learning gentleness”). Psychic distance stays steady; we’re anchored in Mara’s perceptions without head-hopping, even when the spirits’ messages and Elias’s presence complicate the scene. Rhythmic control is generally strong, though there is some tendency toward long, similarly cadenced sentences that risk a slight blur in high-pressure beats. When brief dialogue appears (“SAY IT HERE”), it lands with weight and subtext rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly rooted in Lani’s perceptions, with distinctive metaphors (footsteps like prayers, cast as labyrinth) that feel organic to her. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with pressure, especially in the tighter, more matter-of-fact beats around the radio call. There is no head-hopping; we never slip into other minds beyond what Lani can infer. The voice balances poetic texture with clarity, rarely drifting into overwrought territory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent, slightly wry lyricism that matches Mara’s sensibility as a muralist working with light and memory. Diction, syntax, and image-choice (“moths of paper,” “recessive laughter”) form a recognizable perceptual signature without drifting into abstract haze. The omniscience is modest and clearly tethered to her perspective; even meta-notes like “because even her dream self knew…” feel grounded in her mind rather than the author’s. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative modulation tracks emotional beats well, tightening around discoveries and relaxing into reflection without losing control.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a supple lyricism that matches Mara’s sensibility and profession. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between descriptive density and tighter, more urgent beats (e.g., the nested awakenings around the repeated question). Lexicon and metaphor feel appropriate for an observant restorer in a slightly surreal world—no jarring register shifts. Dialogue is sparse but effective and natural, and the narrative stance never drifts into omniscient explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with entomological and horticultural perceptions naturally inflecting descriptions (“moth dust made their throats close,” pinned butterflies warping into symbols). Lio’s manner of speaking and acting is distinct from the narrator’s inner voice, especially in his riddle-like questions and physical ease. Syntax and rhythm vary with pressure, tightening around the raid without losing clarity. The controlled metaphorical register and the “candidly cryptic” idiom make the voice memorable without tipping into mannered opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinctive—lyric, sensory, slightly formal—and remains closely tethered to Mara’s sensibility without head-hopping or register slips. Diction and syntax have a controlled musicality (e.g., “reef-shadow joy,” “drought of plankton had made the sea lean, and lean seas make angry mouths”) that modulates well between exposition and climactic ritual. The few explanatory phrases feel integrated with the poetic register rather than like scaffolding. It’s a confident, unified voice that could live comfortably in a top-tier literary magazine.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors and diction clearly arising from this caretaker’s strange world and duties. Psychic distance is steady; the narration comfortably blends concrete routine with numinous perception without slipping into authorial explanation. Patterned phrasing (“gently systematic,” “deserted marvels”) is intentional and supports tone rather than reading as scaffold. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from routine to discovery to charged quiet at the end is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyrical texture that matches an “arcane linguist” focalizer. Diction is precise and metaphor choices (scores, symphonies of truth, ink as promises) feel character- and world-appropriate. Dialogue is sparse but functional and differentiated enough—especially Ilyon’s concise admission in Sava—to support status dynamics and thematic subtext. Psychic distance is steady, and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, supporting both lyric description and clear causal narration. Dialogue is sparse but natural and stakes-driven, with the mill owner’s outburst and Mara’s rebuttal carrying subtext about values. There is slight risk of the narration occasionally sounding more essayistic than embodied, but it never breaks POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility (paper as music’s vessel, dust-mapping as temperament-reading). Syntax and diction are elevated but feel organic to the reflective, slightly haunted tone of the piece. Reported dialogue is sparse yet distinct enough to suggest differing stances (Oren’s carefulness, Merek’s weary confession) without breaking narrative texture. Psychic distance is well modulated, tightening around key decisions without sliding into authorial abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“hush fracture around her like thin ice,” “leaps no wider than a human promise”). Diction and metaphor choices feel unified with Mira’s mindset and the world’s surreal physics. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays controlled even as it leans toward the poetic. A few coined phrases (“featherly determined”) flirt with mannerism but remain within an intentional, controlled style.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lucid, and lyrically distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature in how Mira reads environments as constellations. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual—Jonah’s “laugh without sound” and his confession about counting bolts carry more than they say. Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive sentences and leaner action lines, keeping the lyricism from bogging down. It stops short of formally risky experimentation, but within a conventional frame the voice is highly polished.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinct, blending whimsical specificity with a melancholy undercurrent in phrases like “blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes.” POV is stable and knowledge stays within the narrator’s plausible grasp; lyric compression never obscures who knows what, when. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character, and narrative diction feels like a natural extension of this odd profession and world. Under pressure, the voice maintains its texture without slipping into exposition or register mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled metaphors (“diagonals were how you slipped past boredom,” “water tapping the pilings like applause”) and a consistent perceptual bias rooted in Milo’s analytical artistry. Psychic distance stays steady, and the few dialogue lines are natural and character-specific (the watchwoman’s “numbers man” jab, the boy’s absence of voice underscoring his vulnerability). The voice modulates well between atmospheric calm and crisis without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent texture (“glittered like a trapped tide,” “obsidian grace settling over leaves”) that feels suited to a tide dancer’s perception. The keeper’s brief dialogue has a distinct timbre (“voice like wet stone”) and carries subtext about the costs of chosen exile. Rhythm and diction stay coherent under pressure, especially around the anchoring and bargain beats. The register is elevated but controlled, never slipping into explanatory or out-of-character tones.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, confident, and tightly keyed to a glazier’s way of noticing—light, surfaces, lattices, and reflections. Syntax and diction are lyrically elevated but internally consistent, with phrases like “noctilucent reckonings” and “silent arithmetic” feeling like natural extensions of Ilya’s sensibility rather than add-on ornament. Dialogue, though brief, reads plausibly and carries subtext (the inspector moving from rote numbers to moral concession) without expository stiffness.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice around Mara is steady, lyrical without becoming opaque, and conveys a distinct perceptual signature (attention to fire behavior, physical scars, and cosmic scale). Diction and rhythm feel consistent with an experienced firefighter who also thinks metaphorically; the “slow dance of celestial bodies” and “forest began to scream in sap” remain legible and character-colored. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Jonah’s simpler, more tentative speech contrasted against Mara’s measured, metaphor-inflected lines. There is mild narratorial abstraction at times, yet it does not break POV or undercut emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lucid, lyrical, and coherent with Mina’s analytic yet imaginative mind—phrases like “measuring not air but possibility” and “the air feel writable” feel like her way of thinking. Diction and syntax are controlled, with varied sentence rhythms and a consistent narrative distance that doesn’t slip into omniscient exposition. There is no dialogue to test, but the narration itself carries subtext about rationality, wonder, and quiet desperation. The voice holds under “high” moments (ensemble realization, town launch) without drifting into academic or over-abstract register.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close POV is stable, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in sound, architecture, and inherited obsession. Diction is lyrical but controlled, matching a technically minded yet poetic listener; climate and tech terms sit comfortably beside more figurative language. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative distance tightens effectively at key beats (e.g., when she hears her mother’s voice). Occasional high-register abstractions around legacy and burden still feel congruent with her reflective, specialized profession.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a lyrical yet controlled register (“wet book,” “voice had the same calm as a pond that knows stones will sink”) that feels intrinsic to this narrator. Psychic distance is well handled: close enough for interior nuance but not so close that the lyric texture becomes implausible mid-crisis. POV is stable, with no leakage or unmotivated omniscience, and the painter’s brief dialogue carries subtext and authority. Rhythm and diction shift appropriately with pressure—denser around the mirror choice, calmer in the denouement—without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly rooted in Sera’s sensibility (“operatively gentle,” the way she reads ruins and sky). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with enough variation to keep the prose from feeling metronomic. Dialogue is sparse but functional, mapping status and skepticism in a few lines. The voice could risk a bit more idiosyncrasy under peak stress, but as-is it’s polished and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet consistently filtered through Inez’s perception and concerns, with no head-hopping or distance drift. Syntax and rhythm are controlled and varied, supporting both the mythic tone and the incremental pressure. Corporate and technical concepts (“bought aquifers, leased clouds”) are integrated into the same poetic register without jarring register shifts. The patterned metaphors around maps, ledgers, and grace feel like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)

Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately as pressure increases without losing clarity, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional elevated phrases flirt with abstraction but are grounded quickly in concrete images, so the lyricism remains purposeful. Overall, the POV control and narrative idiom are strong enough for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with metaphors and diction that feel plausibly aligned with an urbane, reflective artist. Rhythm varies well, blending lyric description with concrete action, and the “meteor hush” / listening motif is threaded without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but efficient, carrying subtext and stakes (“You reversed the story,” “I did not want my own experiences turned into material”) without sounding expository. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and brief explanatory sentences still read as Ilya’s considered reflections rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with phrases like “pocket of green hung above the cloud sea” signaling a controlled, poetic register that still feels anchored in Arin’s sensibility. The narrative modulation—from quiet description to the tense, rhythmic passage as the monarchs align with the signals—is smooth and purposeful. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction never drifts into an alien register. A slight reserve from 9+ comes from the voice’s relative composure under peak stress; it never quite frays in a way that might further individualize Arin.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature: metaphor and diction rooted in metalwork, music, and cold, with a calm, reflective cadence that tightens appropriately at key moments. The narrative distance is stable, comfortably retrospective yet grounded in scene, and there’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift despite the elevated lyricism. Sentences vary in length and rhythm but maintain clarity; figurative language feels particular to this mind rather than generic “poetic” overlay. The Archivist’s sparse presence reads cleanly within the narrator’s filter.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, rhythmic, and controlled, with a coherent lexicon that mixes mystical diction and tactile grit (“sweet, dusty scent,” “old batteries,” “joke with a blade hidden in the punchline”). POV distance stays stable even in dream sequences; elisions feel purposeful and pattern-taught. The modulation from sardonic precision to solemn acceptance at the end is smooth and character-consistent. At times the density of metaphor slightly threatens to over-saturate, but it never breaks clarity or the voice’s internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with a distinctive blend of archaic gravitas and lightly ironic modern phrasing (“empirically ironic routine,” “reimagined Babylonian palace”) that fits the quasi-mythic, quasi-SF frame. POV is stable with no leakage; the narration’s lexicon plausibly reads as a crafted literary voice rather than in-character speech, which works for this fable-like mode. Rhythm and syntax vary and carry mood well, especially in the closing contrast between proclamations above and his quiet departure. On an elite-venue scale, the voice could be marginally sharpened by a touch more modulation under peak stress—his internal language remains almost too composed at the moment of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly lyrical, and colored by Lio’s pacifist, scheming temperament, with good control of psychic distance. Sentences flex well between compressed exposition (“the healer had called it borrowing”) and sensory-laden description of the sanctuary and city. Limited omniscience about collective cellular memory and refugee swaying feels consistent with the quasi-mystical frame rather than like head-hopping. There are no dialogue mechanics to test, but the silent mouthed words and gestural communication between characters still carry intent and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with imagery rooted in glass, frost, fog, and instruments that feels organic to Lio’s craft. Syntax and rhythm vary well—long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and process, tighter ones when actions crystallize—without losing clarity. The perceptions and metaphors clearly belong to someone who thinks in edges, arcs, and reflective surfaces, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion; the observational distance stays stable and appropriate for the story’s ambitious, dreamy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyric without excess, and consistently colored by Mira’s worldview and history. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with nice textural touches (“contract snapped like dry twigs,” “blue as river shade”) that feel organic to the voice rather than imposed. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the boy’s bluntness and the girl’s simple wisdom differentiating them cleanly. Psychic distance is well-managed, allowing both interior reflection and present-tense responsiveness without confusion or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (museum/archival metaphors, classification language like “filing,” “specimens,” “accession note”). Patterned diction (“simply complicated sequence of events,” “history honest/complicated”) feels deliberate rather than mechanical, and temporal oddities are narrated with calm, intelligent curiosity that suits Mara. There’s minimal slippage in distance or register, and no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent third-person lens that stays close to Lysa while admitting some lightly omniscient touches (e.g., Orren’s original timeline). Diction and rhythm are distinctive—“shelves breathing in chords of paper and ink,” “lesson unlearned…lesson unpaid”—and match the mythic-architectural premise. Dialogue is sparse but functional, always in service of stakes (the clerk’s price, Orren’s warning, the curator’s demand). Psychic distance modulates smoothly, tightening around key beats (renegotiations, the vault) without head-hopping or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with recurring diction around stories, threads, and names giving it a distinct texture. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, supporting both eerie atmosphere and conceptual turns without losing clarity. Expository moments (the mannequin’s explanation) remain in the same voice and don’t break POV bounds. Overall, the narrative stance is confident and controlled, with only minor risk of abstraction in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, precise, and lyrically intelligent, well-suited to an archivist protagonist and the story’s metafictional concerns. POV is stable and close enough to Mara to feel her professional habits and values without drifting into authorial abstraction. Phrasing like “a folder marked Fables of Absence” and “a story told by what remained” establishes a distinct perceptual signature that remains coherent through the climax. The slight editorial flourish in the ending omniscient line still feels compatible with the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistently filtered through a mind that thinks in sound and resonance, giving a strong perceptual signature. Diction choices like “hammered repose,” “storms made of light,” and “crystal honeycombed with small cavities” feel of a piece rather than decorative. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving between close interior focus and broader descriptive sweep without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance remains stable and apt for the mythic-scientific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, cohesive, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in images like “thistle-blown hope” and “maps were ash and radio towers were bones.” Diction and rhythm suit a solitary, slightly lyrical mind, and the narrative distance stays stable and believable for someone long alone with his thoughts. Exposition is folded into voice rather than feeling like manual-dump, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few phrases flirt with over-poeticization but do not materially disrupt the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“thunder rolled along the solid fog like carts on a bridge”) that feels true to a contemplative archivist. Diction and imagery remain consistent with the fantastical-intellectual milieu; abstractions are grounded in physical or sensory correlates. Psychic distance is well-managed: close enough to feel immediate pressure, but spacious enough to sustain the metaphorical texture. There’s no POV leakage or explanatory “helpful narrator” tone; the voice trusts the reader to inhabit its logic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice centered on Jorin is consistent and textured, with perception strongly colored by his craft (thinking in recipes, lift, fuses, filtering powders/stories). Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely between contemplative description and more clipped beats around the fireworks display. Occasional higher-register abstractions sit just inside plausibility for a reflective, craft-obsessed drifter and don’t break the spell. POV control is clean—no head-hopping, no artificial withholding—and the narrative confidence feels appropriate to the quasi-fable tone.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: calm, observant, with a marine-naturalist’s lexicon braided into gentle lyricism (“the silence between them took on edges,” “moment would thicken like syrup”). POV is stable and modest; we never slip into Iven’s unearned interiority, only infer it through gesture and speech. Diction and syntax are controlled and rhythmic without showboating, and the narrative distance tightens naturally around peak beats (cicada use, foresight, final decision). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext and status shifts efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphors that feel organic to the character (“traffic… roared with summer,” “toolbox of invisible fruit”). Psychic distance is steady: we stay inside the adolescent’s perceptions and lexicon without head-hopping or register jolts. Rhythmic variation matches pressure, with longer, more baroque sentences in contemplative moments and tighter ones around the inversion and rope crossing. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative diction alone carries a strong, coherent perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice with light lyricism is consistent and persuasive, mixing technical detail (decibels, storm glass) with poetic framings (“silence was not emptiness but a corridor in transit”) in a way that feels native to Elias’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well-controlled, and limited dips into Mara’s experience stay anchored through observable behavior and plausible inference. Dialogue is sparse but natural, serving goals (reassurance, instruction) without exposition bloat. A slight omniscient sheen in some phrasings risks distancing us from raw emotion, but the overall perceptual signature is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“smelling of ozone and old paper,” “sounded like static from a radio tuned between stations”). Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, supporting the blend of wonder and pragmatism that fits Ione. POV distance stays stable third-person close, with no leaks or unmotivated shifts. Occasionally the diction leans slightly more ornate than her implied practicality might suggest, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, textured, and clearly inflected by Mara’s sensibility, with a strong rhythm and metaphor palette that feel deliberate rather than generic. Lyric compression is well-handled; the story teaches its pattern of figurative density early and sustains it without major slips in distance or clarity. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance tightens appropriately in peak beats like the ring’s rattling. At times the diction risks over-elevation, but it largely suits the quasi-mythic, ritualized frame.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture, with phrases like “shadowseam light” and “palace of lies” giving it a distinctive grain. The narrative distance is stable and the lyricism aligns with Mara’s reflective, slightly fantastical psyche. There is mild tension between the elevated diction and what we know of her background, but the piece reads as a semi-omniscient lyric filter rather than strict sociolect, so it still feels intentional. With no dialogue, the test is entirely about narrative stance, which remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-closely-held voice is consistent, elegant, and distinct, with phrases like “tired histories” and “eloquently silent gaze” giving it a specific texture without drifting into abstraction. Psychic distance is well controlled, and the narration’s elevated diction matches Leander’s scholarly, reserved temperament. No head-hopping or stance confusion occurs, and the voice modulates smoothly from contemplative to quietly decisive at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is controlled and distinctive, with a consistent, slightly liturgical lyricism that matches both Calven’s temperament and the alchemical chapel-lab. Phrases like “factually mystical certainty” and “like counting that also sings” showcase a clear perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy diction. Psychic distance is well-managed, slipping seamlessly between external action and his internal apprehension without confusion or authorial intrusion. The only slight limitation is a relatively narrow emotional register—wonder and eerie reverence dominate—though it remains coherent rather than monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Mara’s sensibility as an archivist and widow; her way of noticing (dust, edges, marginalia) serves as a perceptual signature. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent and believable for this focalizer, with rhythmic variation that supports mood. The brief move into Josie’s immediate reactions is handled through observable detail and questions rather than head-hopping. Occasional thesis-like lines are more a thematic choice than a loss of POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and carries a distinct texture—lyric but not opaque. Diction and metaphor feel consistent with the story’s speculative register, and focalization stays cleanly with Mara’s perceptions and knowledge. The switchboard voice is brief but tonally differentiated, adding warmth and caution without breaking the narrative stance. A few flourishes (“turned every ripple into a line of gold code”) push into high lyricism, but they remain in character for the world and do not disrupt clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrically consistent, and clearly filtered through Lio’s sensibility as a musician attuned to silence and sound. Phrasing like “whisper slid through negative space” and “notes seemed to appear out of nowhere, quietly vivid” matches both his vocation and the speculative premise. Psychic distance stays stable; there’s no head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. The rhythm of the sentences modulates well, with lush description balanced by shorter, decisive lines at key turns (“When the last dewdrop finally detached and fell…”), keeping the voice from becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a clear perceptual signature—phrases like “mossy and delighted” and “smell like rain” feel inseparable from Lio’s sensibility. Syntax, diction, and image-patterns (ash, seeds, handwriting leaves, monuments) are consistent and modulate with pressure without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping; even the brief bit of dialogue from the foreman is clean and status-marked. The prose confidently balances mythic register with concrete tactility, never slipping into abstract exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong lyric texture that fits Mara’s pattern-seeking mind and the slightly fantastical world. Syntax and diction are controlled and rhythmically varied; the narrative never breaks stance or grants knowledge beyond what the focalizer could plausibly infer. Corin’s brief dialogue reads naturally and goal-driven, advancing both revelation and negotiation. A few sentences flirt with abstraction or high-register aphorism, but they remain in character enough not to disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent with a precise, philosophically inclined alchemist (“work that is, in the strictest sense, factually mystical”). Focalization is tight; we never leave Mara’s knowledge-state, and her learned diction fits her profession and world. Rhythm and syntax modulate well—densely figurative in description, slightly plainer under ethical pressure—without losing coherence. Brief dialogue with Ellis is economical and in-character, carrying subtext (his flinch, his bruises) and advancing plot and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with phrases like “a place that loved echoes” and “luminous ache” establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, matching the hush and rising tension of the scene. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and Elowen’s few spoken lines feel psychologically plausible and goal-driven. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and the lyricism never fully overrides clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, blending clinical precision (“proprioceptively enhanced,” “partitioned under drugs”) with lyric sensory strangeness (“the sky…is a bruise that gives light instead of taking it”). Lexical and rhythmic choices are consistent with someone both mathematically literate and deeply traumatized, and the register holds even under peak stress. Patterned elision (“remembering through trauma responses”) is taught early and reused as motif rather than cheap suspense, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. A few abstract formulations in the climax are high-level, but they still sound like this specific mind rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sensory translation and metaphor (“meaning takes shape, elusively tangible like mist”). Psychic distance is steady and appropriate, and the reflective, slightly elevated diction matches a seasoned “between-worlds translator.” There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyricism modulates somewhat with discovery and climax. A few abstract phrasings risk softening immediacy, but not enough to muddy focalization or intent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, distinctive, and consistent, blending technician specificity (“mainspring barrel,” “control cabinet”) with lyrical perceptions (“the city lent me its dead,” “dust never does, and ghosts only point”). POV bounds are respected; the ghosts’ “showing” stays within what he can plausibly infer. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous descriptive sentences and tighter action beats, and the lexicon fits a thoughtful, technically literate narrator. The control is high enough that the piece could plausibly go to print with minimal line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent with Lio’s meticulous, conceptual sensibility; its metaphoric density feels like an extension of his way of seeing the world. POV remains stable and close enough to carry interior stakes while allowing some elegant omniscient-feeling turns of phrase. Rhythms vary well, and recurring constructions (like agreement/negotiation language) feel patterned rather than mechanical. There’s a slight hint of authorial loftiness in places, but it doesn’t break focalization or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Len’s sensibility and history; the prose sustains its register without wobble. Occasional omniscient touches (Yara’s sister) are smoothly integrated and don’t jar the focalization. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately with pressure, especially around the storm and the map-vision. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext and character contrast efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with a tactile, clockwork-magical lexicon that fits Ivo’s world. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with sentences that carry both image and implication without feeling mechanical. The narrative distance remains consistent, and there is no head-hopping or register drift; the mythic, fable-like stance is maintained under pressure. The only limit to going higher is that the voice, while strong, doesn’t quite push into unforgettable idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Mara’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature in how she notices weather, scent, and objects. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, modulating between measured, expansive sentences in reflective beats and tighter phrasing in the cave sequence; the “hinge” motif in diction ties form to content without feeling labored. POV is stable with no leakage or unearned omniscience, and psychometric visions are cleanly cued as her experiences. At times the voice borders on uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens intensity across calm and tense moments.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and strongly colored by Mara’s artistic perception (“fishhook becomes a question mark,” “turbine blade becomes a crescent moon”). Syntax varies nicely, and the narrative stance stays within what Mara can plausibly infer while allowing a gentle, almost fable-like omniscience about time. There’s no dialogue to test, but projected voices and described gestures carry subtext effectively. A couple of abstract phrases (“when words turn tribal”) flirt with essayistic register, but they’re anchored enough in the present situation not to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently aligned with Lina and marked by an artist’s perceptual signature—attention to color, layers, etching, and the interplay of light and night. Syntax and diction are lyrical yet controlled, with long, flowing sentences where appropriate and tighter phrasing at key turns (e.g., “Look through it when the morning goes quiet.”). The narrative never slips into unearned omniscience or explanatory intrusion; even the building’s “exhaling perfume” feels like Lina’s metaphor, not authorial gloss. The modulation of distance (from broader seasonal summary to the intimate act of pressing her forehead to the cold frame) is smooth and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, marrying professional precision (“civil-rights archivist”) with sensuous, haunted perception (“mind were a reel caught in a projector”). Psychic distance is well controlled, moving from cool description to immersive retrocognition without confusion. Diction and syntax feel plausibly the narrator’s—erudite but not academic for its own sake—and the rhythm adapts to pressure without lapsing into sludge. There are no POV leaks or cheap withholdings; even the retrocognition respects the narrator’s experiential limits.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and textured, with a measured, slightly formal diction that matches an alchemist trained in academies yet embittered by them. The prose modulates well, from still, imagistic description of the empty cove to more abstracted but controlled passages when Sen processes the bottle’s meaning. POV remains stable and modest—no knowledge appears that Sen could not infer. A few slightly essayistic formulations appear, but they feel like this character’s analytical mind rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet coherent with Erem’s sensibility—formal, ritual-inflected, attentive to sound and texture. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, from expansive description in the opening to tighter, concept-dense lines as he confronts the prophecy. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; even abstract phrases are grounded in his vocation and worldview. The lyricism never obscures who knows what or when.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lio’s sensibility, with phrases like “a calm animal turning its ear” and “texture of borrowed time” feeling native to his worldview. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with longer sinuous lines in contemplative moments and tighter clauses around key actions, without losing clarity. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; even the grandmother scene in the corridor reads as a vision within the rules established. The lyric compression is confident but never so opaque that it obscures the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Maris’s technical yet sensuous way of seeing weather (“reading every swirl of vapor like script”). Diction is consistent and character-appropriate—technical where needed, but always filtered through her observational bias rather than abstract exposition. Reported dialogue (radio dispatcher, Brother Ivo) reads natural and functionally distinct without disrupting the narrative rhythm. Psychic distance is well modulated, tightening around the zero-hour choice without confusing shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture: meditative, image-rich, with a consistent lexicon that fits Lio’s contemplative, quasi-mystical temperament. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well, with longer lyric stretches in reflection and tighter lines around discoveries and decisions. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative maintains a coherent, confident distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly filtered through this particular recluse’s sensibility, with images like ash “on my tongue like vows I never spoke” defining a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well-controlled: the narration can zoom out to covenant language and then tighten into concrete, sensory detail without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the lyricism modulates appropriately with pressure, especially as the box is opened and the room fills with “mute eloquence.” The lack of dialogue feels intentional, reinforcing tone and concept rather than flattening interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice has a distinct, consistent texture—lyrical yet controlled, with metaphors that fit Eli’s preoccupation with time (“as if faith could tick,” “numbers had gone soft”). POV control is tight; we never slip out of Eli’s knowledge, and Mara’s function is presented through his perceptions. Rhythm and diction modulate well between exposition, scene, and the quieter, charged ending. A hint more individuation in Mara’s spoken voice could deepen contrast, but current dialogue and narration already feel assured and literary.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet coherent, with a distinct texture of metaphor and cadence that plausibly matches a “shoreline poet.” Diction is consistently elevated but not randomly so, and the observational priorities (small flaws, seams, rhythms of anger and water) create a strong perceptual signature. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains steady even as intensity rises and falls. A few abstractions and theme-forward lines are slightly more authorial than character-bound but don’t derail the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person close voice is assured and distinctive, with ecological attention as its perceptual signature (“which fig fed which gull, which moss quieted the bees”). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, supporting a calm, observant tone that suits Mara’s temperament and the accumulative design. Exposition is folded into sensuous description rather than feeling like info-dump. There’s no POV slippage or register mismatch; the lyricism feels earned and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, precise, and plausibly that of a biochemist—terms like “volatile terpenes,” “reaction clock,” and “self assembling” feel organic, not pasted-on jargon. Lyric touches (“pattern too patient for weather,” “bronze quiet”) coexist with technical observation in a stable, character-driven register. Psychic distance stays consistent and interior access is clean, with no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Under pressure, the voice tightens without losing its distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with an excellent perceptual signature (“the jetty has become the throat of a sleeping beast,” “offering the dead a future tense”). Diction and metaphor fit the narrator’s odd trade and world, blending workmanlike duty with numinous awareness. Psychic distance is well controlled; the narrative remains inside his sensibility even when gesturing to large-scale history. The only minor ceiling comes from an almost uniform lyric register—very effective here, but a touch more modulation under peak pressure could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strikingly consistent and idiosyncratic, with metaphors and sensory choices (naming people by sleeve-smell, “storms” as records) that feel native to Lio’s mind. The lyrical register stays coherent even when explaining mechanics (reading grooves with a needle and mirror), and the diction rarely slips into generic abstraction. Rhythm varies well between lush description and tighter, more propulsive beats during decoding and the journey. A slight reservation is that the same high lyric intensity persists even under peak stress, which occasionally flattens modulation rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors tightly bound to the character’s sensibility and situation (fishermen, instruments, fog, compasses). Psychic distance is well controlled: close enough for felt embodiment but with a measured, reflective cadence befitting someone attuned to time. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the rhythms modulate effectively as the narrator moves from disorientation toward resolve. A few lines brush the edge of over-ornateness but remain controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and coherent, blending courtly diction with thiefly pragmatism (“chivalrous thief,” “sacredly playful,” “cautious abandon”). Perceptual bias is clear: he notices locks, keys, stairs, and ritual objects through the lens of wonder and mischief. Limited dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, especially in the chapel scene where a casual answer and pawn move mask the swap. Psychic distance remains steady, with no head-hopping or register slips that break the chosen stance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with metaphors (luminous absence, nomadic penumbra) clearly growing from this character’s sensibility rather than authorial ornament. POV remains stable and modest about knowledge, with no head-hopping; even broad political consequences are framed through what the narrator can see or infer from broadsheets and crowds. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively, supporting both tension (footsteps overhead, tearing bundles) and reflective turns without bogging down. There are no dialogue demands here, and the lyric compression is taught early and honored throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled yet coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature that fuses sensory detail and conceptual metaphor (“as if the building listened for footsteps the way a storm listens for trees”). Diction and syntax are elevated but feel intrinsic to this narrator’s sensibility rather than imposed. The seer’s speech is differentiated mainly by content and gentleness rather than overt dialect, which fits her role as an almost elemental presence. Psychic distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture: precise, pattern-minded, and steeped in chess and weaving metaphors that feel organic to Mara’s mind. Diction and rhythm are consistently lyrical without losing clarity, and focalization remains tight to her perceptions and knowledge. The narrative modulates well from atmospheric description to more pressurized interior beats as she enters the labyrinth. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically charged but controlled, with a distinct sensibility that marries visual detail to moral stakes (“forged hush,” “listening metal”). POV distance is stable; we stay close enough to Mara’s perspective that world-building never slips into neutral exposition. Sparse dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Jalen’s request, the elders’ demands) and supports status dynamics efficiently. Rhythmic modulation between compressed summary and slow-focus moments (the prisms, the final touch on bone) feels deliberate and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature that blends mechanical, alchemical, and spiritual registers. Patterned diction (“every bolt rang like a prayer in a dead temple,” “my mind quilts memories together”) feels character-driven rather than generic-lyric. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. A touch more modulation—brief sharper, plainer beats at moments of peak physical risk—might heighten contrast, but as is, this is high-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and clearly colored by a visual artist’s perceptions; it maintains a consistent psychic distance while allowing reflective depth. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with Lio’s sensibility and the contemplative mode. The narrative stance does not head-hop or over-explain, trusting images and internal turns to carry meaning. Occasional abstract formulations are more stylistic flavor than flaw and don’t compromise clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses technical familiarity (lantern room, service kit) and poetic attention (“blue bone under new light”). Rhythm varies well between lush description and shorter, weightier beats at moments of emotional turn. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Jonas’s attempt to speak loudly only to be stilled by a finger to his lips delivers subtext without over-explanation. The overall stance stays close to the narrator’s experience without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“doors jammed half open like a mouth that forgot how to ask for water,” “geography of loss”). Diction and rhythm are consistent with a reflective, technically literate navigator and never break POV bounds. Sparse dialogue is natural and charged, especially the boy’s understated explanation of the calls and Sera’s near-wordless recognition. Psychic distance is managed well, sliding into reflective summary without losing the scene’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, textured, and controlled, blending precise, slightly scientific diction (“read the ground like a ledger”) with lyrical, emotionally charged images. POV is stable and modest; what Mara claims to know fits her experience, and her reflections grow organically from concrete stimuli. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (Lio’s fear, the captain’s predatory warmth) without over-explaining. Rhythmic modulation suits pressure shifts, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lucid, and quietly lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature that balances workmanlike observation (“I was the harbor clerk”) and heightened image (“the lighthouse beyond breathed its beam”). Eamon’s spoken idiom and presence contrast well with the narrator’s more reportorial stance, giving their interactions texture without over-written dialogue. The narrative distance remains stable and plausible for a reflective recounting of a single charged encounter. The prose occasionally brushes the edge of lushness but remains controlled and in-character, never tipping into an omniscient or authorial register that would break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, observant, and colored by Mara’s empirical-yet-intuitive mindset, with diction tied to her work (contours, survey map, compositor’s grid). Rhythm and syntax vary well, with clean transitions between description, interior inference, and action. Ellis’s brief dialogue and description (“ink stains shaped like continents”) feel distinct yet tonally compatible with the world. There is a faint authorial polish that sometimes feels slightly more lyrical than Mara herself might think, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture—“lacy menace,” “velvet dragged over glass,” “polite and persistent as lace around a throat”—that feels aligned with Maelin’s sensibility. POV control is clean; we stay in her perceptual and conceptual frame without leaks, and shifts in rhythm track the pressure of key beats (the offer, the descent, the emergence). Dialogue is spare but effective, reinforcing status dynamics without expository clutter. At times the elevated lyric register risks feeling slightly uniform, but it never breaks plausibility for this quasi-mythic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and richly textured, with a clear perceptual signature in how Lio reads both light and emotion. Diction like “directed spontaneity” and “density of presence” feel organic to this character and world, and dialogue is spare but effectively charged, especially around “They want you to license your suns.” The narrative distance stays steady, never slipping into unjustified omniscience, and the voice modulates subtlety at the climax without losing its lyric quality. A slight risk of over-elevated register is present, but it remains motivated by the character’s sensibility rather than reading as generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, full of sharp metaphors that feel character-specific (“soar...like a page torn free,” “miracle delivered by a clerk”). First-person focalization is stable, and the blend of precision and dreamlike abstraction matches a lucid dream chronicler’s sensibility. Diction stays within a believable register for this narrator, with no jarring academic or corporate drift. Rhythmic modulation supports emotional beats, tightening around revelations and relaxing in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly Iris’s, especially in how she notices physical traces of emotion instead of scents. Lyricism is controlled and purposeful (“ink blots like swallowed words,” “corridor of half seen faces”) without sacrificing clarity or slipping into generic abstraction. POV boundaries are clean—no head-hopping—and psychic distance tightens nicely in the birthing-house sequence. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Iris’s few spoken lines calibrated to her understated, observant nature.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature grounded in Ila’s sensory and magical lexicon. Syntax and rhythm modulate well with pressure: the description of the storms and table is lush but tightens as she writes. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the master remains external, adding pressure through sparse lines rather than interior commentary. Diction is elevated yet plausible for a rune scholar, maintaining coherence across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, with a rich, metaphor-hungry sensibility that feels specific to Marin’s way of thinking about people and the dead. Diction, syntax, and rhythm are controlled and consistent, and the narrative distance stays stable. The occasional aphoristic line doubles as both her columnist patter and her exorcist philosophy, sharpening character rather than flattening tone. The density of figurative language is high but mostly serves pressure and mood rather than drifting into omniscient lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, blending cosmic scale with intimate self-scrutiny (“wanderingly exact” encapsulates the narrator’s peculiar cognitive style). Diction and rhythm show clear intentionality; long, sinuous sentences suit the lyric, meditative mode, while key moments tighten in syntax without breaking the established texture. The narrative stance remains within what this “end of history witness” could plausibly infer, maintaining a coherent psychic distance. A slight drift toward essayistic abstraction in a few lines keeps it just short of exceptional, but overall the voice is memorable and well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly colored by Ivar’s observational habits and lexicon; it marries technical clarity with lyric images without feeling like an omniscient intrusion. Diction choices like “hydraulic clock shepherd,” “horizon measurement station,” and “fjord quiet” form a strong perceptual signature. The brief bit of dialogue from the inspector is sparse but functional, and the narrative modulation under stress (during ice repair, during the blurry sunrise) is controlled. There’s a slight risk of uniform high-register lyricism, but it suits this character’s contemplative bent and doesn’t break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is assured, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses technical savvy and sensory lyricism (“soft electric smell that made every whisper feel like a match struck in fog”). Diction and syntax stay coherent with Lena’s implied education and temperament, allowing elevated language without feeling authorially imposed. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The modulation from watchful coolness to “quiet wildfire” is controlled and persuasive.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends mathematical language, emotional nuance, and concrete imagery (“light should have a visible grain,” “clover melancholy”). Diction stays plausible for a probability professor’s daughter steeped in academia; the slightly elevated register feels character-motivated rather than generic lyricism. POV discipline is clean—no head-hopping or unearned omniscience—and brief dialogue at the end fits both characters’ established textures. Rhythm varies well between longer, sinuous sentences in reflective passages and tighter beats around discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise yet consistent with Mara’s sensibility; her perceptions (“laugh once, like a door that will not open twice”) feel like this specific person’s mind. POV is stable and modest; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t have. Dialogue is spare but effective, with lines like “Then do the ending clean, and call me back from whatever begins” carrying subtext rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates well with pressure, tightening around the 2:17 call and softening at the charged final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly aligned with Mara’s archivist mind—note the way she thinks in “ledgers,” “rebinding,” and “proximate causes.” Rhythm and syntax vary to match pressure, from more meditative description in the archive to tighter, scene-like momentum at the public covenant. Diction and metaphor feel plausibly hers, not author-generic, and the narrative never slips into omniscient head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. The repeated phrase patterns (“when context changes…you rebind it”) are purposeful, thematically charged, and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct—wry, observant, slightly self-deprecating—and consistent, with lovely turns like “a mayor who refused a badge” and “an altar built by pranksters with excellent manners.” Mara’s spoken lines and described behavior clearly differentiate her from the narrator; she’s quicker, more performative, and the “desperately jocular” quality comes through in dialogue. The narrative distance stays steady, with controlled, poetic compression that never loses track of concrete action. Any elision (e.g., the summary of the rumor’s spread) is purposeful and in keeping with the mythic-urban tone rather than withholding for cheap suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in Iris’s nonvisual world and craft (“quiet blaze of heated needles,” “grammar of heartbeats”). Third-person limited holds cleanly; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond what feels like stylized free-indirect access to her mind. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, becoming denser around the observatory stone and stillpoint without losing control or clarity. The recurrence of phrases like “quiet blaze” and the charged use of technical terms (ultrasonic, platinum, observatory) feel deliberate rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is precise, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature tuned to patterns, tools, and small causal ripples. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively, tightening around the anomaly’s constriction and relaxing into the final contemplative image. There’s no POV leakage or helpful-narrator exposition; all abstractions are grounded in Mara’s way of thinking. The voice feels singular and memorable while remaining fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct and controlled, with metaphor and syntax that clearly belong to this particular mind (“lanterns like floating commas,” “angles of absence”) rather than generic lyricism. POV distance remains stable, and we never slide into knowledge the narrator couldn’t plausibly have; Aster’s whispers are reported through their embodied effects. Rhythmic variation is strong, with long, sinuous sentences used for atmosphere and tighter phrasing at moments of pressure (the foghorn failure, the rush to sign). The language is elevated but consistent with the sensibility on display, so it reads as characterful rather than authorially imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the voice has a distinct lyrical texture that feels organic to Sera’s sensibility and history. Syntax and rhythm vary in step with emotional intensity, from compressed clue-following to more expansive reflection in the archive. Visual and conceptual metaphors (“aisles…like the ribs of a patient beast,” “stubborn flowers of paint and wire”) give the narrative a strong perceptual signature. Occasional explicit labels (e.g., “analytically intuitive”) are minor and don’t materially disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“auroral sorrow,” “waves learning to speak”). POV control is tight even when reporting Sato’s memories, which the story justifies via the entanglement premise, keeping the lens singular. Rhythmic variation and image choice track emotional pressure, modulating from wonder to terror to a quiet, charged poise at the end. A few phrases flirt with over-elevation, but they remain consistent with the narrator’s established sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with rhythms and diction that echo Mara’s meticulous, spatially-aware mind; images like “as if the maze itself lived in her hands” feel organic to her perception. Free indirect moments stay within her knowledge and sensibility, and there’s no head-hopping despite the presence of a small on-page cast. Dialogue is sparse but functional, cleanly signaling stakes and character (Len’s coin-flicking skepticism, straightforward challenge). The lyricism never loses track of physical action, and psychic distance is managed well, tightening around crises without explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—lyric but controlled—with a distinct perceptual signature (“as if his ribs were a staircase winding down to the water”). Psychic distance is steady, gliding between external and internal with ease and no head-hopping. Diction suits a slightly elevated, fable-like register and stays consistent, and moments of elision (e.g., how the shutter patterns work) are legible and purposeful. The only hedge from 9+ is that the voice is more authorial-lyric than clearly marked as either character’s idiolect, though it still fits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture (“amplified quiet,” “where past meets prophecy”) that remains consistent and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Eli’s way of noticing silence and pattern. Psychic distance is well managed, sliding between close interiority and slightly more omniscient civic observation without confusion. There’s no head-hopping, and the modulation from misty, almost mythic description to the intimate tea-with-the-mayor scene is smooth. The elevated diction is justified by the slightly enchanted realism of the world and never feels like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and textured with maritime specificity (“coil a hawser like a dancer,” “barnacles bit,” “argue with open hands”), giving a distinct perceptual signature. POV control is tight, and dialogue carries subtext and status shifts, particularly in the push-pull with Rusk between orders and “combative tenderness.” The cadence modulates well from reflective to high-pressure beats without losing clarity. It falls just short of the very top band only because it never quite takes a formally risky or rhythmically startling leap that would make the voice unmistakable on a first sentence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is consistent, sensory, and character-specific, with an elegiac but slightly wry tilt (“because ordinary action was the only script that did not collapse”). Orin’s theatrically elevated speech contrasts effectively with the narrator’s more reflective narration, making the interplay of registers part of the texture. Psychic distance is managed well, allowing both close embodiment and slightly distanced phrasing without slipping into generic authorial commentary. A few abstract formulations (“emotional void”) skim the edge of diagnostic language, but they’re grounded enough in concrete context not to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured and coherent with a “cloud-shadow poet” protagonist; metaphors feel like her mind’s native language rather than authorial intrusion. Diction and syntax are controlled and rhythmically varied (“as if sound itself has learned to fold its wings” / “her gaze aesthetically driven toward any line that might make grief look symmetrical”). Soren’s more pragmatic register and the formal decree language give useful tonal contrast without breaking focalization. At times the narration edges toward an elevated, essayistic cadence that slightly distances us from embodied urgency, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (texture over color, craft-specific noticing, gentle but wry phrasing like “bartered awakenings, little bursts of clarity”). The mostly external-third vantage occasionally slips into light omniscience with Joren (“he fears the same emptiness”), but the stance remains coherent and does not confuse. Rhythm and diction modulate well between descriptive density and forward motion, and the sparse dialogue feels grounded in character and situation. A slightly clearer commitment to either close-limited or omniscient might sharpen distance control to a truly exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, blending technical and poetic registers in a way that feels character-specific (“save it in jars of quiet,” “a small sun in shadow”). Mara’s speech is terser and more pragmatic, and her “snort” versus later “whispered” reactions track shifting status and vulnerability. The narrative distance is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the diction never slips into generic workshop prose. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between meditative description and moments of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s sensibility as both mourner and craftsperson. Syntax and diction support the mood without drifting into abstract or academic register, and images (e.g., “whispers like dust,” “forge kept low”) feel of a piece. POV boundaries hold; we don’t get unearned access to others, and the narrative distance modulates cleanly from wide worldbuilding to intimate gesture around key beats. The rhythm has purposeful variation that heightens pivotal actions like stepping into the curtains and illuminating the stencil.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on measurement, mapping, and pattern-recognition (“writing in night,” “rain stitched the dusk into silver lines”). Diction and syntax are consistent and plausible for an educated, reflective narrator; Aurel’s few spoken lines are minimal but feel natural within the heightened atmosphere. The voice sustains its texture under the story’s modest pressure without slipping registers or becoming obscure. Lyric compression and long sentences are purposeful and legible, aligning with the accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature—phrases like “atoms of nostalgia” and “my joy at nearing it hurt like a pulled tooth” feel particular to this narrator. The register is elevated but plausible for a devoted historian in a quasi-mythic setting, and the diction modulates well as tension rises around the vault and formula. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and reflective passages remain anchored to present stimuli. A few abstractions slightly thin immediacy, but they do not disturb clarity or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility: dusk, thresholds, and the tactility of stone and blossoms dominate her perceptions. Syntax and diction feel deliberate and musical without tipping into obscurity; even complex sentences remain legible and purposeful. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative distance and tense are stable, and the poetic register fits both setting and emotional stakes. A hair’s breadth below 9 only because the consistently elevated lyricism slightly flattens modulation—peak-pressure beats don’t sharpen rhythm or texture much beyond the baseline beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with imagery and diction that feel plausibly aligned with a careful, observant handler of delicate animals. Rhythm and sentence variation are well managed, allowing lyric description without sacrificing clarity or forward motion. Interior access is smooth and controlled, with no POV leakage or unmotivated shifts in distance. Even without much direct dialogue on the page, the paraphrased conversation feels alive within the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture—“meteor hush,” “chlorophyll syllables,” “as if the room remembers stars”—that remains consistent with Mara’s sensibility and the story’s quasi-mystical realism. Psychic distance is well-controlled, riding close enough to her body and perception to feel lived while still permitting metaphorical flourish that feels like her mind’s idiom, not authorial intrusion. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; telepathic plant speech is cleanly filtered through her experience. The modulation of rhythm—from hushed observation at the start to more compressed, purposeful motion in the tunneling and release sections—supports emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, supple, and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that matches Mara’s sensibility as a crystal gazer and “spatially imaginative” thinker. Metaphors and similes generally arise from her world (film, light, storms, letters), giving the narration a clear perceptual signature rather than a generic poetic wash. Psychic distance is handled well: we move between concrete booth details and larger conceptual patterns without losing track of the present moment. There is a slight tendency toward aphoristic phrasing in a few sentences, but not enough to muddy POV or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with consistent diction (“shadowed rapture,” “bruise of green fire,” “heavy with memory”) that feels native to Sel’s perception. Psychic distance stays steady; we never slip into information Sel couldn’t have, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what the images already imply. Rhythmic variation and syntactic flexibility keep the prose from becoming monotonous despite its high figurative density. There is no dialogue, but the internal voice and descriptive stance carry enough personality to feel distinct and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent blend of technical (“wave functions”) and lyrical (“dawn had gotten trapped under skin”) diction that feels particular to this character and world. POV is stable and confident; there’s no leakage into knowledge the narrator shouldn’t have. Rhythm and image density are controlled so that the lyricism supports the accumulative structure rather than obscuring it. The modulation from descriptive reverie into more taut, charged description when the auditors arrive is subtle but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries philosophical abstraction to material detail (“my body had been mailed,” “probable miracle”). Diction and metaphor feel plausible for a self-described stray philosopher and do not drift into alien registers; the narrator’s speculative turns clearly read as their thinking, not authorial intrusion. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both immediate sensory immersion and reflective synthesis without confusion. The piece teaches its lyric, high-density style early and sustains it through closure without head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close-third voice is lyrically consistent, with images (maps in eyes, shoreline lullaby) that feel like Mara’s perceptual idiom rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance is well managed, tightening around high-pressure beats (descent, wire-cutting) without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but distinct for each guide and efficiently goal-driven (pressing for her name/confession, steering tactics). There’s minor risk of the narrative voice and the guides’ speech living in the same poetic register, but it doesn’t confuse POV or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise yet controlled, with cold and sound imagery recurrent but not overwrought (“my breath sounded like a trespass”). Diction and syntax feel consistent with a thoughtful, observant worker embedded in this world; reflective passages arise naturally from present stimuli. The REMAIN messages and the sparse spoken dialogue (“C”) are economically handled and carry significant weight. Psychic distance stays steady, and the perceptual signature—attuned to dust, touch, and small mechanical failures—is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically omniscient yet consistent, with long, flowing sentences that match the mythic, archival subject matter. Diction choices (“regally unpretentious,” “graceful collapse,” “collapsed prayers”) give the prose a distinct texture and perspective. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains controlled even as it occasionally zooms out to comment on empires and ages. The very high sentence density risks blurring moment-to-moment emotional nuance, but it feels like an intentional stylistic decision rather than loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Mara’s professional and emotional lenses; phrases like “periodically eternal” feel character-appropriate rather than authorial drift. Exposition about the ban, beacons, and reef policy is woven into her perceptions and choices without breaking distance. Rhythm varies well between descriptive calm and tenser investigative beats. There’s minimal dialogue but what’s present (the hooded woman’s explanation) carries subtext and pressure without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature: mechanical and celestial imagery, bodily sensitivity to vibration, and an almost devotional regard for tools and ruins. Syntax varies nicely between long, flowing descriptive sentences and tighter, action-oriented lines as pressure rises. Diction stays within a plausible register for the character and world, and there is no head-hopping or stance wobble. The repeated phrasing around “thunder,” “hum,” and “stones” feels patterned rather than repetitive, reinforcing tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward living systems and coded patterns (reeds, moss, crystals, kite-tail script). Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, using parallelism and image chains without becoming monotonous or obscure. The retrospective stance remains plausible for the narrator and never slips into omniscient knowledge beyond her access. The modulation from solemn history to quietly wondrous climax is handled smoothly in the same voice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Mina’s precise, traumatized yet analytical mind. Diction like “salt wind braided through pines” or “body kept a catalog of danger” feels consistent with a quiet, observant polyglot rather than an intrusive author. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, marking status gently (Harlow’s apology and question; Mina’s boundary-setting with the teen). Psychic distance remains stable, and shifts into interior framing (“pearl of stillness”) are clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, coherent perceptual signature: metaphors are consistently visual and tactile, grounded in painting, light, and threads. Psychic distance stays tight without head-hopping, and the lyricism modulates appropriately as pressure rises (denser at peak moments around the lens, slightly more spacious at the end). Purposeful uncertainty about the exact mechanics of reality remains under Mara’s interpretive frame, not authorial drift. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative rhythm and diction show confident control.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, textured, and clearly filtered through Keir’s perceptions, with consistent diction that matches his role and temperament. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, with a controlled lyricism that rarely tips into opacity. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and speculative elements are introduced with confident, character-grounded narration. A few explanatory lines could be slightly leaner, but they do not seriously compromise voice or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel native to an archivist in a frozen, censorious city. Diction (“cryogenic archivist,” “Archive Riots,” “copper veins”) is elevated but coherent with the narrator’s role and world. Rhythm modulates effectively between reflective density and sharper, decision-point clarity. There is no POV leakage or artificial explanatory aside; the narration trusts the reader to keep up.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward plants, texture, and heat that feels specific to Maris’s world. Third-person focalization stays stable, with brief omniscient touches (e.g., on Tarek’s scanning) still reading as aligned with an external but steady narrative stance. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with long, flowing sentences that suit the contemplative yet tense mood. Minimal dialogue feels natural and purposeful, carrying shifts in power without breaking the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel native to this world (“reeds… like wolves trying to remember a lullaby,” “voicing silence”). Psychic distance stays steady in a close third anchored in Rovan’s perceptions and operational mindset. Rhythm varies well, with long, lush sentences in calmer description and tightened cadence under pressure, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift. The voice feels authoritative and character-inflected enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive—precise, slightly wry, with metaphors rooted in Celeste’s world (ink, planets, headlines). Diction and rhythm are consistent and well modulated between reflective and investigative beats, and dialogue (especially Celeste’s and Sato’s) carries subtext about power and anxiety without exposition dumps. The narrative never breaks POV bounds or drifts into generic register. A few thematic formulations (“orbit of regret”) feel a touch authorial, but not enough to disrupt the overall strength.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and idiosyncratic—Lio notices the world in astronomical and auditory metaphors in a way that feels character-anchored. Syntax and rhythm vary gracefully, with lyric density that rarely muddies clarity, and exposition is folded into image rather than explanation. Dr Sato’s brief dialogue is functional and distinct enough, and the haunted firmware’s voice is cleanly framed. The control of distance at the climax (from description of the shelves sighing to the intimate apology) is especially strong.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and distinct, mixing tactile artistic detail with gently uncanny perception (“lilac unease,” “making every footstep sound like it was happening to someone else”). POV control is tight; we stay within Inez’s interpretive frame even when describing communal action, and shifts in psychic distance feel purposeful. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the narrative idiom suits the speculative-literary register without lapsing into essayistic abstraction. Rhythm and diction modulate with the pressure of the proverb scene, maintaining clarity amid lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (“wrists locked in steel cuffs that also carried bread”) that suits the story’s moral seriousness. POV stays stable around Samir with brief, legible dips into Lina’s perception when she steps onto the stone; there’s no disorienting head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status and subtext—Lina’s bitter laugh and question about “what name” turns a simple line into a thematic hinge. A few narrator-level explanatory sentences slightly distance us from Samir’s mind, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice through Mara is consistent and distinctive, with her synesthetic mapping of senses forming a strong perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied, supporting the slightly lush, magical-real tone without tipping into self-consciousness. A mild omniscient slip (“because he too could sense time as flavor”) briefly stretches strict POV bounds but doesn’t confuse or undercut the lens. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct texture—“the power grid clicked like an anxious tongue,” “as if the air itself remembered where her hands had been”—and stays consistent. Diction is elevated but still plausible for a narrative focalized through an artist with a scientific streak. Psychic distance is well-managed, slipping into lightly lyrical omniscience without confusing who knows what or when. There are no POV leaks or jarring register jumps, and the modulation between clinical description (“somatic markers”) and tender observation (“hugging their lawyer as if he were cold”) feels intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a persuasive blend of technical and lyrical diction (“factually mystical,” “trained to taste air currents”). Mina’s perceptual signature—reading heat, salt, and tremors as information—is distinctive and stable, and the narrative distance is well controlled. There is no head-hopping or gratuitous exposition; reflection is anchored in present stimuli. The lyric register is elevated but remains believable for a specialized, solitary professional in this speculative context.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly inflected by Lysa’s sensibility—attentive to small dropped objects, time’s texture, and the acoustics of prophecy. Syntax and rhythm are varied and intentional, creating a distinct perceptual signature without sliding into vagueness. The narratorial distance holds steady, never leaking into information Lysa couldn’t plausibly infer within this mythic frame. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself carries subtext and pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical yet controlled diction that fits Rina’s reflective, professional sensibility and never strays into jarring registers. Rhythms vary well between atmospheric description and tighter action, and Tomas’s brief lines of dialogue are spare but distinct, carrying subtext. Metaphoric motifs (“silver hush,” “tilt of the earth toward spring”) are consistent and not over-explained, and POV boundaries stay clean. The only minor limitation is that under acute stress in the cave the narration retains a slightly uniform lyric calm, where a slight roughening of texture might sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture: lyrical yet grounded in occupational and sensory specificity. Rowan’s perceptual signature—listening for what isn’t said, reading raised scars in vellum—gives the narration character-inflected authority. Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct in register; Senn’s lines carry confession more than ornament. At times the diction clusters toward elevated lyricism, but it remains internally coherent and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, Galen-centered POV is stable and confident, with a strong perceptual signature—craft metaphors, attention to texture and process, and a contemplative rhythm. Diction and syntax hold to a lyrical but controlled register that feels appropriate to a meditative artisan observing a strange phenomenon. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Sera’s blunt resentment of the oasis contrasts with Galen’s more metaphorical language, keeping voices distinct. Psychic distance is well-managed, sliding closer for key insights (“softness is a kind of alignment”) without breaking the established stance or withholding known facts.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent—lyric without drifting into an abstract register Mara couldn’t plausibly sustain. Phrasing like “fear without a task is what kills her” and “a steady cadence that seems to instill courage in her ribcage” builds a clear perceptual signature, and the narrative distance stays steady, with no head-hopping. Jonas’s presence is sketched more through action and small gestures than stylized dialogue, which suits the tone. A few metaphors verge on lush, but they remain controlled and character-colored rather than generic-poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinct—its lexicon and metaphors (petrified coral pylons, “carrying their shadows like a passport nobody checked”) feel like the perceptions of someone straddling epochs. The reflective, slightly formal register fits a reincarnated scholar type and stays consistent under pressure. Rhythm and sentence variety are well controlled, with lyricism modulating smoothly into more pointed clarity at key turns (the names list, the warning, the decision to copy with errors). There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated exposition; all reflection is anchored in present stimuli and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward metaphor and tactile detail (“silence felt like a tug on some hidden thread”). Diction and rhythm are controlled without feeling mannered, and the poetic turns are plausibly within this character’s lexicon as a professional wordsmith. Psychic distance is steady; we never leave the narrator’s interior while still tracking external action cleanly. Dialogue is sparse but natural, serving as pressure rather than exposition, and there’s no head-hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a consistent blend of technical precision and slightly lyrical phrasing that matches Mara’s role and temperament. The prose filters observation through her professional and ethical lens (e.g., seeing arguments as altering the beacon), which sharpens POV specificity. There’s no head-hopping or register slippage; even abstract ideas feel grounded in her experience (wartime logs, studio gear, grit under nails). Rhythmic modulation around the 2:13 a.m. surge and the subsonic “prayer” moment shows good control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and unmistakably particular, blending technical diction (“blueprint drafting compass point”) with mythic, almost liturgical phrasing. Syntax is long-lined and sinuous but controlled, matching the exploratory, anxious-yet-determined mind. The narrative distance stays tight to the narrator’s perceptions and lexicon; surreal events are framed as lived experience rather than authorial flourish, preserving trust. Rhythmic modulation—especially around the organ beats and the climactic drive of the compass—shows a high level of control.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a cool, analytical texture warmed by flashes of moral urgency (“my studio ledger reads like a lab notebook, because method is the only way I can keep people from melting into one another”). Syntax and diction reflect a mind trained to parse fragments into systems, and that perceptual signature doesn’t slip. Lyric touches (“kindness practiced to a shine,” “laugh like broken glass”) feel character-appropriate rather than authorial. Dialogue is sparse but apt, and exposition is carried in rhythmically varied sentences that maintain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—meteorological and cartographic metaphors, attention to charts, isobars, and instruments. Lyric compression (“rain that seemed to soak straight into thought,” “as if the ground were spitting it back”) feels character-compatible rather than authorial intrusion. Distance control is good: we stay inside Mara’s priorities even when exposition (Reversible Exile) appears, maintaining her lens. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the rhythm modulates effectively between investigative momentum and reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, metaphor-rich, but coherent and character-bound (“bridge-song fiddler,” “collodion like moonlit syrup”). POV is steady and confident, with no leakage or artificial “helpful narrator” exposition. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure while keeping a consistent perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a perceptual signature shaped by roads, borders, and threat-markers. Syntax and rhythm vary well, moving between compressed summary and slower, image-rich lines without losing clarity. Register fits a street-smart yet observant narrator who now operates in startup and cartographic language. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the modulation at the end into a more reflective register feels earned rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with astronomy and dreaming idioms fused into a coherent perceptual signature (“numbers refused to settle into meaning, and the observatory felt like a ship stalled in black water”). Psychic distance is managed smoothly, shifting from declarative summary to close sensory interiority at pressure points. There’s no head-hopping and no register drift; the elevated style suits a lucid dream chronicler and remains plausible. The modulation between clinical observation and vulnerable confession under stress is especially well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending a druidic, ritualistic lexicon (“expanding circles,” “warlike serenity”) with concrete action. The perceptual signature is strong—Thalen notices circles, roots, wind, and the behavior of lost objects in a way that feels character-specific. Narrative distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge; the few explanatory lines mostly feel like practiced understanding rather than authorial intrusion. At times the voice leans toward explanatory summary of magic mechanics, but not enough to damage its integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“tomorrow had jumped the rails,” “voice dry as bark,” “dead future”). Diction and metaphor align with Lysa’s sensibility and the story’s mythic register, and psychic distance is well-controlled—intimate in key emotional beats, slightly more omniscient in framing without feeling like head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext and moving the plot (“Heed me,” and the covenant explanation). The rhythm and image-patterns under pressure (at the seal, during the wound) heighten stakes without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with metaphors (“smile thin as onion skin,” “ash falling like dark pollen”) that feel specific to this world and consciousness. Diction balances elevated lyricism with clarity, and the narrative never claims knowledge outside Mira’s plausible awareness. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, advancing pressure and revealing power dynamics without exposition dumps. Psychic distance is well managed, tightening around key choices without slipping into essayistic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, believable texture: technically literate about sound and objects, quietly self-lacerating, and attentive to acoustic nuance. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with someone who has lived both in touring crews and appraisal niches. Brief dialogue from Marla is economical and characterful, advancing plot and revealing her history without speechifying. Psychic distance stays steady, with reflective passages smoothly anchored in present stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Nerin’s translator’s mind, with analogical thinking embedded in diction (“treats its curvature as a grammatical marker”). Syntax and rhythm vary to suit contemplative pressure, and the accumulative, metaphor-rich style is taught from the first line and maintained without jarring shifts. There’s no head-hopping and no artificial withholding, and the limited omniscience stays plausibly within his perceptual and conceptual range. At moments the density of metaphor edges toward saturation, but it rarely muddies sense or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the librarian’s idiosyncratic metaphors (“winter moon hung like a clipped coin,” “tomorrow disappears,” “tide murmur like a patient lecturer”). Diction and syntax feel of a piece—elevated but not abstract, with a steady, contemplative rhythm that modulates slightly around key beats (introducing the furnace, the naming scene) without breaking pattern. The POV’s knowledge and inferences stay plausible for someone embedded in this role and place; there is no head-hopping. The narrative’s perceptual signature is strong enough to be recognizable on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Mara’s technical profession and emergent spiritual awe. Phrases like “latent radiance” and “as if the world were listening for a decision” feel of a piece with the story’s mode rather than pasted-on ornament. Distance control is good: we move smoothly between action, concise backstory, and conceptual reflection without head-hopping or jarring register shifts. The voice occasionally states insights a bit directly, but overall maintains an effective, slightly mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is coherent, textured, and character-specific: technical diction (“grid number,” “intake gate,” “map references”) sits naturally beside lyrical turns (“like the river has been living here too”). Psychic distance is well-controlled, flexing closer in the bathroom and at the intake gate, then slightly widening for the reflective last line. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated language feels plausible for a meticulous surveyor with an artistic inheritance (the father’s accordion). Rhythm varies and supports pressure without slipping into mannered repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-close voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism that matches the surreal premise (“bottled dawn,” “words you could almost hear”) without drifting into incoherence. The narrative distance stays steady, colored by his temperament—phrases like “cautious exuberance” and “honest in its dishonesty” feel like extensions of his sensibility. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with long, unfolding sentences suiting the deciphering process and shorter declarative beats anchoring turns (“He understood then that the library did not store other people's secrets”). The only minor limitation is that the high-poetic register occasionally feels slightly authorial rather than purely character-channeled, though it never breaks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, blending professional lexicon (“provenance,” “maker’s mark”) with sensuous, plant-inflected perception (“bright as sap,” “mulberry ache”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing compressed reflection without losing scene immediacy, and there’s no head-hopping. The occasional elevated metaphor feels plausibly within Liora’s introspective, slightly baroque register. A few densely figurative lines skate near overrichness, but they don’t obscure who knows what or what is happening.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture that feels plausibly aligned with Mara’s sensibility: beauty, mortuary craft, and electromagnetic metaphors all braid together. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with long, flowing sentences that match the meditative pressure. The diction (“lucidly watchful,” “radiant hush,” “threshold of stillness”) is elevated but coherent and steady rather than showy for its own sake. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays intimate without lapsing into exposition or meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits Mara’s sensibility and the quasi-mythic setting, with controlled metaphor (“like a swallowed moon,” “chalky petals”) and consistent diction. Psychic distance is well handled, sliding smoothly between her immediate perceptions and more reflective passages without confusion. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative confidence about what can be known matches the focalization. At times the voice leans close to the authorial in its aphoristic turns, but it generally feels anchored in Mara’s way of thinking rather than imposed commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in metaphors like “conscience could be packaged like lamp wicks” and the cloak that “breathe[s] back questions.” Psychic distance is well-managed, slipping between external detail and interior reflection without confusion. A few abstractions (“protected vulnerability,” “welcome nuance into certainty”) flirt with essayistic register, but they largely suit a thoughtful, self-analytical protagonist. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, and the narrative never leaks into omniscience or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with strong control of metaphor and rhythm that matches the contemplative, uncanny situation. Lior’s spoken lines are spare but distinct, matching his age-discordant solemnity and careful withholding. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. A few phrases skirt the edge of workshop-lyric (e.g., “my own breathing sound like a confession”), but they mostly feel organic to this narrator’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Oren’s sensibility, with diction and metaphors tuned to stone, sound, and age (“harmonic stone skimmer,” “sound lines,” “dust memories”). Rhythm varies well, and the prose maintains lyric intensity without losing orientation or sliding into abstraction. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; everything we learn is plausibly within this character’s mode of perception. The voice is distinct and memorable, though an occasional easing of metaphor density in non-peak sentences might sharpen contrast further.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with controlled metaphors like “screens that wrote poems and sigils faster than any hand could tremble” and “brilliant dimness” setting a strong tonal palette. POV discipline is excellent; we never leave Davin’s perceptual frame, and information is neither coyly withheld nor dumped. Rhythm and diction flex with the moment—more incantatory in description, tighter and more concrete in action—without losing texture. The idea-engine’s polite, procedural register contrasts effectively with Davin’s more sensory, yearning narrative idiom, sharpening the thematic divide.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled and distinct, marked by synesthetic perception and workmanlike attention to lamps and tools, which keeps the language from floating away. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a reflective but grounded narrator; metaphors like “waterline looked stitched with small moons” and “library…opened like a throat” feel character-driven rather than generic poeticism. Psychic distance is well-managed, allowing both sensory immersion and reflective insight without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. The lyric intensity is high but not monotonous, with quieter, plainer clauses balancing the more ornate ones.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture—lyric but precise, with images like “a bruise lit from within” and “footprints that form behind a walker” that feel specific to Mara’s worldview and the story’s physics. Narrative distance stays tight, with no head-hopping and only information Mara could plausibly infer. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, growing denser around conceptual turns without losing clarity. The voice successfully carries considerable abstraction without sliding into academic or generic register.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a distinctive blend of formality, sensory precision, and restrained emotion that fits a reaper who has seen too much. Diction (“bruised relics,” “scattered beams that crossed like thin bridges”) is elevated but consistent with the character’s contemplative, quasi-mythic register. Psychic distance is well-managed, allowing us to feel both the ritual’s mechanics and the ache of lost love without head-hopping or expository over-explanation. The voice modulates gently—growing more intimate and haunted as the scene darkens—without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice is close and consistently tinted by Evin’s mechanical, counting mentality, yet retains a supple lyricism (“as if the sea has finished its argument”). Diction and syntax are controlled, with varied sentence rhythms and a distinct perceptual signature that doesn’t slip into generic register. The few lines of dialogue are economical and reveal status dynamics immediately. Occasional quasi-omniscient touches (“he almost smiles at the plausibility”) remain coherent with the established narrative stance rather than undermining POV.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism (“even water sounds like listening,” “each shingle reflecting the same pale, judgmental sky”) that feels grounded in Mara’s sensibility and job. POV remains stable and plausible in its knowledge, with reflection consistently anchored in present stimuli (label, photos, mud imprint, chime). Rhythm modulates well between denser reflective passages and more direct narrative moves like the drive back and town meeting. There’s a slight risk of the narrator sounding more essayistic than stressed in a few lines, but it doesn’t undercut coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Liora’s: an alchemist who thinks in ratios and reagents but also in smells, textures, and emotional memories. Diction (“steady blue tongue,” “small music in leaves”) is distinctive without slipping into anachronistic or academic registers. Psychic distance is well controlled, hovering near her interior without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. The one minor ceiling is that the voice maintains a similar lushness even under supposed stress, slightly flattening modulation between calm and heightened beats.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, blending technical calm (“landing revision,” “private ping”) with metaphorical perception (“lanes that only moonlight revealed,” “voice arrived like a stone dropped into a deep well”). The narrator’s perceptual signature—reading breaths and phrases as patterns, feeling echoes inside the skull, using touch to anchor thought—feels character-specific rather than generic. Diction and rhythm modulate well with pressure, tightening around the twin parachutes and relaxing into a more reflective cadence at dawn without losing clarity. The absence of on-page dialogue avoids any risk of register clash and keeps the focalization clean.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries metaphysical concepts to tactile images (wind bells ringing “in two tones at once,” “braided gravity ropes”). Narrative distance is stable and apt, allowing reflection without losing immediacy, and the occasional dialogue snippets are embedded cleanly. Elevated diction suits the speculative-philosophical frame and rarely feels out of step with the narrator’s implied education and experience. There are a few abstract phrasings that skim toward essayistic, but they do not materially disrupt the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending a noirish register (“storm-born silence,” “locks click feel louder than a confession”) with the analytic precision of a designer/inventor. Mara’s “perceptual signature” is strong: she frames everything through puzzles, mechanisms, and experimental method, which feels both character-driven and tonally apt. POV is clean with no head-hopping, and the slight lyric compression (e.g., “orthogonal approaches”) reads as her own professional idiom. Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush sentences for atmosphere and tighter ones around key beats like the door knock.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on tools, acoustics, and labor. Syntax and diction feel slightly elevated but still plausible for a close external lens on Bram; rhythm modulates well between long, symphonic sentences and sharper beats. There is no head-hopping or distance confusion, and the narrative certainty stays within what this perspective can reasonably frame. A few phrases nudge toward purple, but not enough to blur the emotional line.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, slightly archaic, and dream-struck—yet remains coherent and controlled throughout, with metaphors (“air had the foggy lucidity of thoughts that almost became daylight”) feeling specific to this narrator. Psychic distance is steady: we live inside their perceptions without head-hopping, and the guardian’s spoken voice is clearly differentiated (rasping, slightly formal, rooted in books and thresholds). Rhythm modulates well, lengthening for contemplative passages and tightening around the lunge and breath-at-the-edge. There’s no “helpful narrator” over-explaining; explanation arrives as part of the character’s lexicon and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture (“her tears had learned to stand at attention”) that remains coherent and character-inflected rather than generically ornate. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping; Jun’s perceptions come through dialogue and brief cues without violating focalization. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately between description and action, and the few lines of dialogue feel natural within this slightly elevated register. The voice is strong enough for a top-tier venue, with only minor risk of over-lushness in places.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: technical yet lyrical, attentive to cables, coils, and hums as much as to cosmic events. Diction (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush,” “blueprint for rebuilding the city as a listening post”) is precise and character-appropriate for a “celestial signal interpreter,” avoiding register drift. The rhythm modulates well—longer, textured sentences for atmosphere, tighter ones around key choices—without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance wobble appears; the narrative confidence matches what Mara could plausibly intuit.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and lightly lyrical, with just enough technical vocabulary (berths, lines, chart table) to ground in Lina’s professional perspective. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences carry texture without becoming purple, and the narrative maintains an effective psychic distance throughout the strange events. Explanatory lines (“Lina understood the vanishing commuter ferry was the seam between parallel timelines…”) are perhaps a touch more direct than the rest but still feel like her understanding catching up, not authorial intrusion. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she notices patterns and work details that holds even under climax pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and coherent, balancing technical precision (“counted angle,” “proofs in a notebook”) with feverish lyricism. Diction and syntax feel plausibly like an intellectual, slightly ill artist—no register slips or unexplained omniscience. The perceptual signature (seeing smiles as knots, a coat becoming a lung) is distinct and stable, especially under stress. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the slight distance from other characters reads as intentional isolation, not POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, lucid, and gently lyrical, with a distinct conceptual lexicon around geometry, horizons, and depth that feels native to Mara’s profession. Rhythm varies well, combining long, syntactically intricate sentences with cleaner declaratives at key turns (“Above it the stars were painfully bright”). There’s no head-hopping, and the slight omniscient shading (“everyone still mourned”) fits the communal, somber-marvel tone. The voice is strong enough for top-tier venues, though it stays in a relatively uniform register rather than pushing toward truly idiosyncratic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet clear, with consistent diction that fits Mara’s reflective, observant temperament. Sentences have varied rhythm, and repeated phrasings (“reeling hush,” “incidental heroism”) feel like deliberate motifs, not tics. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, and the dead woman’s calm, insidious cadence contrasts effectively with Mara’s grounded responses. Psychic distance is well-managed, sliding closer at peak moments (recognizing the photograph, hearing-aid flares) without head-hopping or explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and textured with restrained lyricism (“crashing hush,” “phase mouth”) that fits Mara’s technical yet haunted perspective. Sentence rhythms vary with pressure, tightening in the crawl and loosening at moments of reflection. Technical terms (reactor coil, trunk cable, pressure lock) are integrated without breaking the poetic register. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory hand-holding; the prose trusts the reader while remaining clear.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and tightly aligned with Mara’s perceptions and preoccupations (breath, counting, cold, faint mechanical sounds). Lyle’s dialogue via speaker/radio has a distinct timbre—measured, slightly abstract, tinged with wryness—that differentiates him cleanly. Rhythmic control is strong, with longer, sinuous sentences handling atmosphere and shorter ones sharpening beats like “She stops at six thousand, two hundred, and one.” The only small ceiling is that a few lines of reflection come close to authorial articulation rather than staying fully character-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature obsessed with textures, sound, and anatomical imagery. Third-person focus stays cleanly on Ilen, and the diction (“copper-veined,” “ruined organs,” “structured chorus”) harmonizes with his sensory priorities and the world’s strangeness. Rhythm modulates well between long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter lines at key turns (“That was when the curse showed itself…”). There is no awkward exposition or register drift; the voice feels unified and intentional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending academic precision (“cryptid researcher”) with lyrical perception (“air tasted of…old grief people carried behind their teeth”). Diction choices like “gravitationally playful” and “frostbitten hope” feel organic to this narrator’s mind rather than imposed from outside. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Jonas’s questions and Edda’s dry pragmatism read as separate idioms—and the POV never wobbles. The only small limitation is that, under peak stress, Mara’s narration remains extremely composed and elaborately figurative, which risks slightly undercutting the immediacy of fear.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Lio’s sensibility as a musician attuned to rhythm and vibration, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Comparisons (“as if velvet could file metal without sparks,” “tags quiver like guilty teeth”) feel motivated by that sensibility rather than generic flourish. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice distinctions, but narrative distance and tense remain stable. Under stress, the voice maintains control without slipping into authorial summary or expository explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—compressed, metaphor-rich, yet controlled and clear. It maintains a stable focalization around Ivo while allowing brief, clean access to Nela’s perspective through action and simple speech, avoiding head-hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate well between hushed description and more kinetic beats (the storm release) without losing coherence. There is no dialogue proper to test, but the narrative idiom feels consistent with character and world rather than generic “literary” register.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a strong perceptual signature in how Rowan “feels” sound as pressure and gleam rather than noise. Syntax and rhythm vary well, matching the slow, attentive mood of a craftsman moving through a haunted space. Diction is consistently tuned to the story’s dreamlike, tactile register (bells as “commas in a sentence he might finish,” the train as “ribcage”), without conspicuous register slips. Occasionally the lushness risks slight over-saturation, but it never confuses POV or temporal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a controlled, slightly wry lyricism (“lab notebook written in iambs,” “treated it like a bookmark for the air”). Syntax and rhythm vary with purpose, and the perceptual signature—math-poetry metaphors, focus on angles and curvature—is unmistakably Mara’s. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence matches what she can plausibly infer. If anything, the elegance is almost too smooth; a touch more roughness or fracture at key turns could further heighten voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically confident yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (“paid in shells and silence,” “believing that if longing had a cipher…”) that feels specific to Mina’s world. Diction is elevated but not incongruent with the slightly fable-like frame, and psychic distance is steady, letting us inhabit her obsessions without head-hopping. Rhythm varies well across long, sinuous sentences and tighter phrases, especially around the climactic doorway. There’s no reliance on expository telling to patch gaps, and the single spoken line from the silhouette feels tonally aligned with the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent in its way of noticing (cosmic metaphors, tactile micro-sensations, spatial oddity). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, dreamier sentences around the descent and brief, weighty shifts at the key beats (“At once the silver comma clicked, not in my mouth but in my chest”). The locksmith’s sparse, slightly gnomic dialogue contrasts effectively with the narrator’s more sensory interiority. POV remains tight and stable, with no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person, close-focus voice has a distinct, consistent texture—lyric yet precise, with folkloric metaphors that feel organic to Lissa’s profession and psyche. Phrasing like “listened for lullabies in engine noise” and “each touch an attempt to recover stolen memories by feeling the world remember her back” shows a strong perceptual signature. Distance and tense remain stable, and the modulation from wistful to sharp, recovered clarity at the mushroom moment is well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident and coherent, with a distinct texture (“the forgotten library listens like a lung holding breath”) that still feels anchored in Lio’s sensibility. Dialogue is tight, goal-driven, and character-specific: Lio’s “combative tenderness” contrasts well with Mara’s sharp, defensive lines, and their exchanges advance both plot and relationship. The narrative stance modulates cleanly between close observation and slightly more panoramic social commentary without head-hopping or register whiplash. Elision and compression are purposeful and never obscure what the focalizer can plausibly know.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinctive perceptual signature—phrases like “a hymn sung under one’s tongue” and ink “the color of their scent” feel character-specific rather than generic. POV is stable and interiority is woven cleanly into observation; Soren’s speech patterns are simpler and more declarative, giving him a separate texture. Rhythm and diction modulate well between hushed observation and more intense beats at the waterfall without losing coherence. The elevated register is well-matched to the mythic, fable-like frame and rarely overreaches.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with distinctive diction that matches the character’s craft and world (“broken mask restorer,” “interlaced hush,” “heart of stormlight”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both close sensory immediacy and mythic exposition without head-hopping or register slips. Patterned phrases and invented terms are taught early and used coherently, so lyric compression never obscures what’s happening. The modulation from tense ritual to quiet, reconfigured dawn is handled smoothly in voice and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctly colored by Lena’s profession and temperament—she reads people through maps, treats objects with gentleness, and her language reflects that bias. The diction and syntax are lyrical without tipping into self-consciousness, and the narrative distance stays stable. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the slight omniscient-feeling touches (“the same impulse that made her frame maps so gently…”) still feel anchored to the piece’s reflective tone. It’s polished and particular, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: dryly wry, technically literate, and quietly lyrical in a way that feels specific to a diver-scientist haunted by loss. Diction is consistent with that persona, and the personified Death/“Dee” interjections fit her psychology without breaking POV bounds. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, from compressed observation (“silence has measurable pressure at forty meters”) to more expansive reflective sentences, without slipping into logorrhea. The perceptual signature—what she notices, how she analogizes—is strong and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person-close voice is consistently tuned to Lio’s sensibility—mechanical, musical, and quietly reverent—and maintains that signature from first sentence to last. Diction like “tinkersong melody, half lullaby and half gear click” feels both character-true and stylistically controlled, not generic-poetic. Psychic distance is steady, with lyric compression that still respects what Lio can perceive and infer. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation under pressure (as thunder approaches) tightens rhythm without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with Lysa’s perceptions (“the diary was becoming a ladder built out of light”) giving the prose a distinct sensibility. Diction and rhythm are lyrically elevated but stay anchored in concrete specifics and never drift into omniscient commentary or authorial abstraction. No head-hopping or stance wobble occurs; the captain’s presence is mediated entirely through how she reads him. The only arguable stretch is how sophisticated some metaphors are for a very young servant, but the voice reads more as a stylized close third than an implausible first-person.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and distinctively colored by Mara’s profession and grief—metaphors are sky- and instrument-centric in a way that feels character-driven rather than generic. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping smoothly between sensory immediacy and reflective recall without losing the now of the crisis. Diction remains coherent and avoids register clashes; the one line of reported pilot speech is minimal and functional. It stops just short of 9+ because the lyricism, while strong, doesn’t quite push into a uniquely idiosyncratic rhythm that could only belong to this character.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is precise, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensory and cognitive biases (hands, posture, sound, recursive patterns), creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with long, image-rich sentences for atmosphere and tighter, action-oriented clauses around the coin and foreman beats, without losing clarity. Diction balances poetic metaphors with concrete mechanics (indentations, recursion rule) in a way that feels organic to an artist-scholar mind. There are no POV leaks or register jolts; any lyric elevation is clearly character-appropriate rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Lio’s personality, with metaphors and perceptions (e.g., “paper remembered better than people,” light “stranded” like “unseen snow”) forming a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm stay coherent throughout, and the narrative stance does not overreach what Lio could plausibly infer in this lightly fantastical world. There are no POV slips or clumsy expository intrusions, and the modulation from quiet observation to excited discovery feels controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyric yet controlled, with a distinct texture in its metaphors (“sunlight…ground into powder,” “tools clinking with the tired patience of driftwood washed ashore”) and a consistent, character-inflected lens. Focalization is stable and does not leak beyond what Mara could plausibly perceive or infer. Rhythm modulates well between lush description and clearer, more functional lines when actions and choices matter. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative distance and diction remain coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person plural voice is confident and controlled, maintaining a coherent collective perspective without head-hopping into individuated interiority. Diction and rhythm are distinct—phrases like “brambled hope, scratched and snagging” and “star-scented window” signal a specific sensibility rather than generic SF narration. Psychic distance is handled well, zooming from summary of months to precise, charged moments (ringing the bell, watching Serren brighten) without confusion. The modulation at the end into a more luminous register feels earned by events rather than like a tonal lurch.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically omniscient but controlled, with a distinct texture (“bruised awe,” “fraction of time stored in brass”) that feels unified throughout. Psychic distance is stable: we sit close to Mara’s perceptions early and widen at the end to a mythic, panoramic stance without jarring head-hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, tightening around the adjustment and sacrifice, then broadening as the hush spreads over continents. The prose’s elevated register is justified by the quasi-mythic frame and never drifts into expository flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with syntactic rhythm and diction that feel like one particular mind (“a maze of slate corridors…patrolled by mechanical birds,” “offhandedly exact”). POV control is tight; information is limited to what this caretaker plausibly knows and infers, with no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Lyric compression coexists with clear action, especially around the waystone assembly and bird release. Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Mara by role and response without straining naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinct: scientific, metaphorically musical, and ethically preoccupied, with a stable perceptual signature. Lexicon and imagery are coherent with a polymer chemist who hears instruments in lab sounds and reads foam “as if reading a score.” Psychic distance tightens and loosens smoothly with emotional beats, and there is no POV leakage. The lyric register is elevated but feels earned rather than generic or inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, texturally rich, and consistent, with metaphors and perceptions clearly filtered through someone who lives inside this peculiar library-economy. Syntax varies well and modulates with the scene’s movement from calm observation to charged recognition without losing control. There’s no head-hopping, and the occasional conceptual density remains legible. The lyric register is elevated but feels organic to this narrator rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Safi’s sensory preoccupations: rain worries the desert, stone remembers how to sweat, remorse is treated like spice. The third-person focalization stays consistent and controlled, with figurative language arising naturally from the food/taste/water/coral palette. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with lush but readable sentences that compress time and memory without confusion. There is no head-hopping, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels like an intentional stylistic choice rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct texture (“borrowed starlight,” “lonely grammar”) that matches Mara’s musical, archivist worldview. Diction remains consistent and doesn’t drift into alien registers; the few snippets of dialogue (Nine’s baritone, Mara’s multilingual responses) are brief but purposeful and naturally embedded. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between external description and light interiority without confusion. At times, the narration risks feeling slightly authorial rather than tightly character-bound, but overall the perceptual signature is strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—phrases like “helix-minded engineer” and “quaking reverie” feel both character-true and tonally unified. Diction balances technical (“synaptic plasticity,” “periscope”) with lyrical imagery, reflecting Nira’s dual identity as engineer and dream-archaeologist. The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying inside her perceptions without unmotivated omniscience. No dialogue is needed; the interior narration carries subtext and pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinct, marrying cool archival precision with lyric strangeness (“sorted light the way others sorted paper,” “water dripped upward”). Diction and imagery feel appropriate to a “prism-minded archivist” without slipping into extraneous registers. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both atmospheric description and character-linked perception without head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure nicely, tightening around key beats (the door, the dial, the hour’s end) without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctly Lysa’s—technical vocabulary like “porcelain insulator,” “telegraph wire,” “intervals” feels organic to a “tree-song sculptor” rather than imposed. Syntax has a measured, almost musical rhythm that suits the quiet world and modulates slightly as she moves from tentative experimentation to a more expansive plan. There’s no POV leakage or register drift; the small touches of quasi-poetic description stay inside a plausible reflective interiority. The only tiny limitation is that the voice remains uniformly lyrical; a sharper shift in texture at one or two emotional inflection points could intensify contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits Sable’s contemplative, precise mind and remains consistent throughout. Syntax and diction are elevated but coherent, with metaphors drawn from chess, sky, and magnetism in a way that feels like a unified perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse yet effective, with Mera’s “hopeful melancholy” presence fitting the tonal register. There are no POV slips or manipulative withholdings; elision is used for compression rather than coyness.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture anchored in Lio’s attention to sound and silence (“pre-ignition silence, communal, held in the throat like a shared secret”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a character who “quoted poets to pigeons,” so the elevated language feels voice-justified rather than imposed. The narrative stance maintains a stable psychic distance, slipping naturally between observation and interiority without confusion. Minor moments of explanatory phrasing (“the path to empathy was suddenly practical”) slightly flatten the otherwise strong, character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—“turning of the tide’s thought,” “wildflower hush,” the scent lexicon—while staying consistent with Jun’s sensory and professional biases. Rhythm and syntax are varied and modulate well between contemplative exposition and the press of the bloom scene; the pattern is taught early and maintained. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and even expository lines (about the corpse flower’s function) are folded into character-specific discourse. It isn’t radically experimental, but it’s assured and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual bias of a pilot who reads the world through motion, gravity, and water. Syntax and diction balance lyricism with clarity—phrases like “while the air around the arches held a whirling silence that made even engines seem like thoughts” establish a distinct tonal register that the piece sustains. Psychic distance stays stable; we never drift into information Lysa couldn’t plausibly infer. The modulation from outwardly descriptive to inwardly conceptual at the end is smooth and feels like a natural intensification rather than a register break.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture: an investigator who thinks in technical metaphors (“air behaved like a liquid”) and precise yet slightly lyric phrasing. POV distance and access remain stable; we never head-hop, and the narration’s knowledge tracks what this particular professional could infer. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent with a meticulous, somewhat poetic technician, and the modulation under pressure (shorter, more kinetic clauses during the sprint to break symmetry) feels intentional. There is no dialogue to test character idiom, but the narrative voice itself is strong and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinctive, and consistent, with synesthetic perceptions shaping diction and metaphor in a character-specific way. Rhythm and sentence length are well modulated, supporting both lyric description and moments of crisis. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the retrospective framing around the Council scene remains under the same tight focalization. At times, the density of figurative language flirts with over-richness, but it rarely obscures perspective or intent.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Liora’s sensibility; phrases like “every cliff held a muted storm” and “surfaces of listening” feel like her way of perceiving the world. Diction is elevated but coherent with a character steeped in ritual and relics, and psychic distance is well controlled. There’s no head-hopping, and the brief reported dialogue from the pilgrim feels natural and purpose-driven. The lyric register occasionally edges toward uniform solemnity, but overall the perceptual signature is strong and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to printing, math, and celestial imagery. Third-person focalization remains stable around Kestrel while allowing a gently omniscient-tinged lyric distance, and the rhythm modulates well between description and conceptual turns. Phrases like “arguing in different tenses” and “world were being typeset and erased” feel both stylistically unified and character-anchored. There’s no head-hopping or register slippage, and the patterned diction of printing and equations is taught early and carried through.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent access to Rook’s perceptions and a distinct way of noticing (e.g., “the only warmth in his pack was a dragonfly-wing pendant”). Dialogue is sparse but reads natural and in-character, particularly Mara’s understated challenge to ownership and the lamplighter’s dazed farewell. The narrative distance holds steady, and the brief visionary expansion with Nera on the ridge feels like a natural extension of the established magic rather than a POV slip. Rhythms and diction match the slightly fable-like, speculative tone without drifting into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with lyrical yet precise diction that matches a grieving narrator willing to entertain the uncanny. Lio’s spoken idiom (“proof was not a courtroom trick but a way to handle what we touch with care”) is recognizably his and aligns with his role as a grounded mystic. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narration never claims knowledge beyond what the focalizer can plausibly infer in the moment. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with intensity, particularly around the mirror flare and the closing reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent in diction and rhythm, with a distinct fondness for extended metaphors that still track cleanly. Phrases like “seasons slide like cards” and “raveling silence” feel of a piece with Yara’s textile-centric world and not like imported abstraction. Psychic distance stays steady—close enough to feel her stakes, far enough to maintain fable-like compression—without head-hopping or stance confusion. The only mild drawback is a relatively uniform sentence lushness that might benefit from an occasional sharper, shorter cut, but it does not impair control.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-inflected, with blacksmithing and orchard details shaping its sensory bias. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively, allowing lush description without losing clarity or emotional focus. The occasional elevated phrase (“azure defiance,” “memory loosen, slipping into confusion”) feels congruent with the fable-like register rather than imposed. POV control is tight; there is no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature—mapping by taste, touch, and airflow—that feels inseparable from the character. Diction is elevated but coherent with a reflective, technically skilled narrator and modulates appropriately with tension. POV control is tight, with no leakage or cheap withholding; the shard/seam mechanics are revealed as they matter. Moments of lyricism are purposeful rather than ornamental, maintaining clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close-third voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that mixes working knowledge (“skiff,” “filament”) and lyrical metaphor in a way that feels like Noah’s compressed thought rather than authorial intrusion. POV control is clean; we never slip into Maris’s interiority, yet her state is visible through observed detail. Rhythm modulates well with pressure—longer, more sinuous sentences for atmosphere, slightly tighter ones under action—without monotony. A few phrases push toward the lyrical edge, but they maintain clarity and coherence with the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with striking but controlled metaphors like “my jokes landed like dropped coins” and “a liturgy of angles, salt, and mirth.” The diction feels plausibly like a reflective, slightly mystical lighthouse keeper, and the psychic distance stays stable. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences balanced by firmer declaratives at key turns. It stops short of feeling utterly singular at the sentence-music level, but it’s already well above most publishable work.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and sensorially anchored (“my new heart thudding politely,” “let my sutures become honest scar,” “dye so blue it seemed to drink the air”) while plausibly belonging to a reflective artisan. POV is steady with no leakage or unmotivated shifts, and the lyric density feels taught from the first line and maintained without obscuring action. Rhythm modulates well between contemplative and active beats (the sun-tracking sequences, the final underside discovery). Eno’s few spoken lines are economical and in-character, serving as action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured with idiosyncratic diction (“sheets of moving ink,” “arithmetic of sadness,” “flakes of sleep”), clearly belonging to someone both technically competent and quietly visionary. POV control is clean: no head-hopping, and the narrator never claims knowledge beyond their plausible inference and experience. Lyricism is balanced with procedural detail (tool belts, bolts, numbered bends) in a way that feels like this specific worker’s mind rather than generic fantasy prose. Modulation under pressure—particularly from the pin-drop corridor to the roof revelation—is smooth and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a distinct texture—“rivers run backward,” “promises echo twice,” “bound release at the center of her craft” all feel of a piece. Psychic distance is stable and suited to a mythic tone while still tracking Lysa’s priorities and pain. Diction and rhythm remain coherent under pressure; the narrative doesn’t lapse into flat summary even in explanatory moments. The uniform lushness risks slight monotony, but the voice is controlled enough that it still feels deliberate rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice filtered through Marin has a distinct, calm, slightly aphoristic texture that suits a hyper-empathetic recluse. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“nested paradoxes,” “staying while leaving”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Dialogue, when it appears, is concise and functional, carrying character and stakes without exposition dumps. The POV stays stable and modest, with only gentle, plausible expansions into broader observation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited POV through Mina is consistent and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature centered on “creeping normality” and small violations. The narrative voice is lyrical yet precise, with Sada’s dialogue carrying a distinct, measured cadence that contrasts Mina’s more anxious noticing. Phrases like “heuristically gentle” lightly stretch plausibility for Mina’s casual lexicon but also contribute to the story’s stylistic texture. Overall, distance and access are well-modulated and there is no head-hopping or explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistently refracted through Ilian’s temperament, with metaphors of light, ice, and frequency matching his work and worldview. Diction and rhythm are deliberate, with enough syntactic variety to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the narrative distance stays stable. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift; the occasional elevated phrasing suits the mythic, contemplative tone of the piece. At times the lyricism slightly smooths over Ilian’s rough edges, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., hearing betrayal as vibration, reading ring-taps as certainty). Syntax varies with pressure; longer, sinuous descriptive lines give way to tighter movement as the climax nears without losing clarity. Diction sits comfortably between lyrical and concrete, matching Mara’s observational acuity without sliding into anachronistic abstraction. With no dialogue, the piece leans entirely on narrative voice as action, and it carries that weight smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on synesthetic sensing (taste-as-compass, ribs-as-radio). Diction balances technical (“diagnostic ink,” “ionic swings”) with mythic (“forests held elections,” “terrestrially cosmic gravity”) in a way that feels native to this consciousness. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (carriers’ suspicion, the narrator’s ambivalence) without exposition dumps. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing reflective context without losing immediacy in the present-tense scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that fits an observant, image-obsessed artist; metaphors about light, music, and laughter read as character-true rather than generic. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The narrative confidently withholds exposition in favor of sensate detail and motivated reflection, e.g., the joke-rhythm memory cue. At times the register edges toward the ornate, but it remains internally consistent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is distinctive—lyric, metaphor-rich, and closely aligned with Mara’s sensibility as someone who cares about words and surfaces, yet it stays clear and controlled. Patterned images (breathing glass, composted words, Sable’s reactions) are handled with confidence and without head-hopping or distance confusion. The register occasionally edges toward the authorially elevated rather than strictly Mara-bound, but the consistency of tone and diction makes this feel intentional rather than sloppy. Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush sentences balanced by shorter clarifying beats at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Lysa’s craft and this world’s nonverbal culture. Diction and imagery (ledger stone, gray felt, “truth had a spectrum”) feel of a piece, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Rhythm varies well, long sinuous sentences for description balanced by tighter clauses around key turns (Auditor’s touch, ledger dissolving). The elevated register is justified by the fable-like, speculative tone and never drifts into impersonal essay-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive and consistent, with a lyrical, slightly elegiac texture that matches an android whose routines are “stitched with lullabies he could no longer hear.” Diction coheres with the POV’s hybrid nature—technical terms sit naturally beside sensory and metaphorical perceptions—and psychic distance is well controlled, tightening around peak beats without explaining what’s already shown. The narrative never cheats on knowledge or head-hops, and patterned phrases (“contain chaos,” “north shifts”) are used as structural motifs rather than crutches. Reserve from 9+ comes only from a couple of moments where the narration edges toward essay-like phrasing (“because every repair manual he trusted started with the same line”) rather than fully inhabiting embodied moment-to-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: observant, gently ironic, and grounded in Mara’s curatorial sensibility and ethics, with images that feel character-specific rather than generic. POV is steady and modest, not over-claiming knowledge, and reflection is well anchored in present action. Rhythms vary nicely between lush description and tighter narrative advance, with only occasional lines that sound slogan-like or meta-thematic. Overall, the prose sounds like a particular mind under a particular pressure rather than a neutral narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, with lines like “water surged in a thin sheet, cold as diagnosis” and “her calm defiance was the only dry thing she could breathe” giving a strong perceptual signature. POV remains stably anchored in Lyra’s perspective, and the occasional dialogue is spare, in-character, and subtextual (her lullaby-tone answer to the guardian). Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure without slipping into self-conscious grandiosity. The only minor limitation is that the lyric register slightly flattens emotional spikes, keeping us at a cool, poised distance even in peak danger.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinct yet controlled, with recurring phrasal patterns (“silence that sounds like light,” “pockets of gravity”) that feel like Lysa’s mind rather than generic lyricism. Diction and metaphor stay consistent with her world—lamps, salt, sea, rot, crystals—creating a strong perceptual signature. Compression and elision are used purposefully, and despite the density of images, the narrative remains legible with a stable psychic distance. There are no POV leaks or register jolts; a touch more rhythmic variation at peak beats could heighten contrast, but this is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent diction and a strong perceptual signature oriented around sound and silence. Phrases like “a terrestrially cosmic pull” and “a silence polished until it could slide between syllables” feel of a piece, not like borrowed registers. Psychic distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The elevated style matches Liora’s contemplative, ritualistic mindset and never loses clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual style (“meteors stitched white seams across the dark,” “steam were a script”) that feels true to someone obsessed with language and buildings. POV is clean and stable, with no head-hopping and a controlled mix of present action and compressed backstory. The modulation from wonder on the roof to careful manipulation during the inspection, then back to quiet, uncanny intimacy, is smooth and tonally coherent. The high-register diction occasionally risks feeling a touch self-conscious, but it remains within the believable lexicon of this narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., light “quarantined” from day, petals “drinking the remaining purple sky”) that aligns with the world’s logic. Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful, modulating from ornate description to slightly more grounded, clinical language in Sol’s explanations without head-hopping. Mira’s interior filter infuses the metaphors, making them feel character-rooted rather than generic. The elevated register is sustained without significant slips into flat exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Liora’s reflective, crafted sensibility, and it sustains a coherent psychic distance throughout. Diction (“pearl twilight,” “calibrated treason”) and syntax feel intentional rather than generic, with subtle modulation as pressure rises. Dialogue is sparse but functional, delineating Senn’s bureaucratic certainty against Liora’s quiet resistance. The lyricism is occasionally dense, but it never muddies who knows what or where attention is directed.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct idiom that marries worldbuilding and emotion (“pale as moon bone,” “reed-blown melancholy”) without drifting into meta-explanation. Psychic distance is well-controlled: the narration stays close to Lira’s perceptions while allowing a light mythic inflection suited to the material. Dialogue is minimal but pointed—Mael’s use of Senn’s echo and Jaro’s delayed shadow-answers carry subtext and world logic rather than expository chatter. There are no POV slips or unearned omniscience, and the rhythmic modulation between journey summary and in-scene confrontation supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is tightly focalized through Mara, with consistent lexicon and a lyrical, image-rich texture that feels like it belongs to a diver attuned to ghosts and wrecks. Phrasing such as “voices rise like breath in cold air” and “translated only what she could confirm” establishes a distinct perceptual signature and modulates well between investigative precision and poetic resonance. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; elision around the exact mechanics of dreams and ghosts feels purposeful rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical yet clear, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft metaphors and pattern-seeking. Jiro’s speech is aphoristic but feels earned by his role as an “old net-mender philosopher,” while Ren’s contributions remain more straightforward and grounded. POV distance is steady third-person with close access to perception but without head-hopping or unjustified knowledge claims. Rhythm and diction modulate well between lush description and more clipped, purposeful dialogue or action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, observant, and character-specific, with lines like “being sharply observant was less a talent than a survival habit in the new dust” establishing tone and worldview. Diction is consistent with a hard-bitten investigator in a speculative setting, and brief dialogue snippets feel natural and carry subtext (e.g., “The curse,”/“The beacon.”). POV control is tight; no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps. Rhythm modulates well between compressed exposition and slower, atmospheric beats without losing the narrative’s personality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent, slightly baroque texture that matches Eli’s sensibility and the bricolage-science setting—phrases like “a forest of bent antennas” and “grim y whimsy that matched his own” feel particular rather than generic. POV distance is steady and legible, and brief dialogue is character-specific and purposeful. At times the diction borders on ornate saturation, but it remains controlled enough not to obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly keyed to Sato’s worldview, with recurring diction (“gleaning,” “sweeten sorrow,” “translator”) that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with long, sinuous sentences used to accumulate texture and shorter clauses landing turns, especially around the music box’s awakening and the widow’s reaction. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice distinction, but interior and narrative stance remain coherent and controlled. Occasionally the omniscient-leaning narrator smooths over rough edges of Sato’s mind, keeping us half a step above raw immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a strong perceptual signature centered on sound and tactility (“air tasted of metal and winter apples,” “creaked like an old ribcage”). The narrative distance is well-controlled, slipping into mild lyric omniscience at the very end without breaking coherence. Diction matches the slightly elevated, contemplative tone yet still feels anchored in Lio’s sensibility as a methodical, feeling engineer. Rhythm varies nicely, with longer lyric sentences modulated by cleaner, functional beats around action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Irena’s sensibility, with a distinctive lexicon of horizons, moon paths, and iron that feels like an extension of her mind. Syntax is confidently varied, with long, sinuous sentences matching the contemplative, accumulative mode without losing clarity. There’s no POV leakage or awkward explanatory intrusion; the narrator’s authority and distance remain stable. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the lyric register sometimes smooths over what could be sharper, more stressed modulation at peak tactical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctively tuned to Mara’s sensory and professional habits, with consistent attention to sound, physical evidence, and procedural detail. Syntax and diction are elevated but coherent for a highly trained investigator, and the rhythm flexes between dense descriptive stretches and sharper, decision-focused lines. POV boundaries are clean; even when the lantern brings in “memories not her own,” the experience is clearly filtered through her perception. There’s no dialogue on the page beyond Kellan’s disembodied instruction, but that line’s slickness (“sliding…like oil”) matches the established narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled register that matches Elias’s reflective, observant mind. Phrasing like “vibrant hush” and “before realization” gives the prose a distinct texture without slipping into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but character-specific, especially in Mrs. Halden’s understated, cutting line and Darren’s plea about not wanting forgiveness as a prize. Psychic distance shifts slightly to accommodate Lena and Mrs. Halden but remains anchored under Elias’s lens at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinct—witty, metaphor-rich, and slightly sardonic (“read warning labels for plot,” “laughed like a priest caught stealing candles,” “poetry pretending to be math”) while staying plausibly within Mara’s sensibility. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance modulates well between playful and awed as stakes deepen. Rhythm and diction are controlled; the prose feels intentional rather than generically “lyrical.” The only limitation is that the high figurative register is quite constant, so moments of pressure don’t get a markedly sharper or sparer modulation that might heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with an observant, technically literate archivist; metaphors (servers as a muffled choir, threads as roads) feel organic to her mind. POV control is clean with no head-hopping or register jolts, and the narrative distance stays steady while modulating intensity around key discoveries. Purposeful elision (e.g., not over-detailing technical steps) supports density without disorienting the reader. The voice carries both corporate dryness and haunted intimacy, which suits the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly lyrical, and closely aligned with Mara’s perceptual priorities (maps, pressure, emotional undercurrents), giving the narrative a distinct texture. Syntax and rhythm vary pleasantly, and the recurring phrasing (“weighted breath before reply”) functions as a controlled motif rather than a tic. Descriptive choices (e.g., “lantern room glowed like a patient eye”) feel organic to the world and tone. There is no head-hopping or register slip, and the voice remains coherent under conceptual and emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphors that feel rooted in this mind (“skull had lost its latch,” “lungs were closing like wet paper”) and a stable psychic distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—the storm passages tighten slightly while retaining her associative texture—without losing clarity. Brief dialogue (mostly Signe) is economical, character-specific, and thematically loaded. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the perceptual signature remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is distinct: observant, metaphor-rich, and grounded in vineyard work, with a calm, reflective cadence that suits a night watchman used to solitude. POV remains tight and consistent, with no head-hopping and a clear temporal flow. Dialogue is sparse but rings true, serving more as scaffolding for subtext and shared attention than exposition. A few register spikes (“intersubjective understanding”) push the lexicon toward the academic, which may feel slightly at odds with the otherwise tactile, workmanlike sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person-limited voice through Iri is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on edges, peripheries, and subtle tells. Syntax and rhythm vary deliberately, supporting the hushed, tensile mood without becoming monotonous. The prophet’s spoken lines feel spare and in-character, with the real work done in implication and gesture. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the lyric elevation feels rooted in the world’s texture and Iri’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrically inclined but grounded in Mara’s perceptual habits (arcs, maps, scent, texture). Sentences vary rhythmically and the narrative distance stays stable; we never head-hop or get information the focalization can’t reasonably supply. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, particularly Mr. Gant’s “memorial or a trap for ghosts” line and Mara’s “doorway” reply, which carry subtext about how to relate to the dead. The voice is distinctive and consistent without feeling mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: precise, metaphor-rich, and plausibly scholarly without lapsing into antiseptic abstraction. The narrator’s way of noticing—margins, bindings, lexicons, compost—feels both character-specific and thematically aligned, and the “fractured sequence” structure is announced and then honored cleanly. There’s no head-hopping; distance remains steady, with controlled lyric compression around high-concept ideas. The only constraint on a higher score is that the Council and apprentices’ spoken voices are largely summarized rather than dramatized, so we don’t see the voice flex through direct dialogue pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close-third voice on Mira is lyrical yet controlled, with a strong perceptual signature (“magnetic hush thick as fog,” “tidal longing”) that feels organic to her sensibility. Orrin’s dialogue and presence carry a distinct idiom and rhythm, clearly differentiating him from the narrative voice. The lyricism occasionally edges toward uniform lushness, but it remains legible and purposeful, modulating with emotional beats rather than flattening them.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-inflected, with a strong perceptual signature around cameras, timing, and mechanical detail. Syntax and rhythm vary well, moving from long, imagistic lines to tighter, action-focused ones as pressure peaks, and there’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience. The register sometimes edges toward authorial-poetic more than strictly Mara’s inner diction, but not enough to break coherence. Overall the prose feels confident and deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice, largely anchored in Mara, is lyrically consistent and attentive to sound and sensory crossovers in a way that feels character-specific. Diction and rhythm are controlled; long, flowing sentences match the contemplative tempo without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with Jonah’s guardedness and eventual softening implied more than declared. A few metaphors (“shard of night,” “a heartbeat shared by strangers suspended in sky”) lean toward the familiar, but they don’t disrupt the tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture: calmly lyrical, pattern-obsessed (loops, circles, hinges), and consistently filtered through Liora’s rune- and craft-oriented mind. Syntax and diction are stable and apt; phrases like “when the sky felt trustworthy and the lenses stopped lying” teach the lyric pattern early and sustain it without tipping into opacity. Psychic distance stays steady and close enough to feel present without head-hopping or authorial intrusion. Under stress the voice remains measured, which suits Liora but slightly limits dynamic range, otherwise this is elite-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending clinical observation (“healed collarbone set perfectly”) with lyrical, character-specific turns (“a fact that would not bruise anyone”). POV remains stable and plausibly limited to Rowan’s knowledge while allowing modestly elevated diction that fits his reflective, educated stance. When dialogue appears (“If you are a changeling…”), it’s lean, in-character, and carries subtext rather than exposition. Sentence rhythm varies well with the emotional temperature, supporting both the investigative beats and the quiet, charged ending.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with metaphors (“slow sky,” “zephyr bloom of salt and fern”) that feel particular to Lio’s sensibility as a grounded star watcher. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping smoothly between sensory observation and interior reflection without head-hopping or register clashes. Diction remains coherent and purposeful, and the single on-page spoken line aligns naturally with the established tone. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure—more flowing in descriptive spans, more pared when he confronts memory—demonstrating strong control.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“servers lay like tombstones,” “a quiet that tasted of sap”). Diction and metaphor feel organic to this character’s sensibility rather than generic-poetic, and modulation around Jun’s arrival is well-handled. Dialogue is minimal but effective, with Jun’s single question carrying subtext and pressure. There’s no POV leakage or register drift, and the lyricism remains legible under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly filtered through a writer’s sensibility, with metaphors anchored in pages, drafts, and narrative devices. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled; the prose modulates intensity as Mara moves from desk to nexus to closure without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the patterned elision (e.g., “shredded chapters,” “broken metaphors”) feels intentional rather than vague. The voice is distinctive if slightly generalized—more personal idiosyncrasy could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and lyrically precise, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., “small jars of captured starlight,” “like an elder refusing to leave before the song ended”). The narrative distance hovers at a close-lyric remove from Marn without head-hopping, and the diction is cohesive, never dropping into jarring modern registers. Rhythms and syntax are well-modulated, allowing images room to breathe while maintaining forward motion. Overall, the voice feels confident, distinctive, and well-matched to the fable-like, ritualistic content.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person/limited-omniscient voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism, rich in metaphor yet consistently filtered through Eira’s ritualistic, material-minded perception. Syntax varies in length and rhythm to match contemplative pressure, and diction remains coherent with the invented world’s tone. There is no head-hopping; the slight broadening at the end to notice the cartographer’s “reluctant clouds” still feels centered in the established narrative stance. The voice’s texture is memorable and confident, though it occasionally borders on uniformly elevated, leaving little modulation between peak and baseline intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, close-but-lyric POV is consistently handled, with a strong perceptual signature (peripheral noticing, “reading” metal, attention to seams and reflections). Syntax and diction are controlled and suited to a thoughtful artisan in a quietly fantastical world. Rhythm modulates well between denser descriptive passages and clearer action beats, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is distinctive and confident, though its even, meditative tone occasionally softens perceived urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textural, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “my loom was only my hands,” “the air held a shingled hush”). Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively between long, sinuous lyric sentences and tighter, choice-focused lines at key turns (e.g., noticing the burner’s alignment, the calcification). Lexicon and imagery remain coherent throughout—whale, bone, ribs, roof, shingle, lattice—making the voice feel like a single, idiosyncratic mind rather than generic poeticism. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusion; the voice trusts its own strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise yet consistent with Miriam’s outlook—practical, sensory, and circus-informed—avoiding register jolts. Metaphors (“collecting seconds as if they were splinters,” “silence…pacing like a cat in corners”) feel organic to her history and never blur who is perceiving. Psychic distance is handled deftly, moving from wide atmospheric openings to fine-grained interior decision points without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative cadence modulates smoothly with emotional intensity and carries a distinct, memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically textured yet coherent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Mara’s time-blurred consciousness (“yesterday arrives as a smell and tomorrow as a bruise”). Diction, syntax, and metaphor consistently reflect her relationship to machinery, stories, and regret, and the narrative distance remains stable and intimate without slipping into authorial explanation. When the ghost speaks, its borrowed voices and actions are relayed in a way that fits the established voice and maintains focalization. Rhythm varies effectively between dense, imagistic sentences and more direct, causal ones at structural turns, supporting both atmosphere and legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, specific, and colored by Lina’s engineer’s sensibility (“load paths and human paths,” “flow diagrams that treated people like water”). Diction and rhythm are lyrical but not incongruent with her profession, giving the piece a distinct, confident texture. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflections anchored in immediate stimuli (the sextant, diagrams, pumps). There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and character-specific, with a clockmaker’s and would-be composer’s attention to ticks, pulses, and measures. Diction like “excruciatingly gentle and steady” and “even my pages wanted a different use” feels organic to his sensibility rather than ornamental. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving from close perception to reflective commentary without slipping out of his knowledge or perspective. The rhythmic modulation—from lush description to tighter beats around the bear encounter—supports emotional shifts effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, close, and distinctly textured, with a controlled lyricism that matches Mara’s reflective, pattern-seeking mind. Diction (“errant legend seeker,” “architecture of lies,” “engineered quiet”) feels cohesive and character-appropriate rather than generically elevated. Rhythm varies well between denser reflective sentences and more propulsive action beats (tying off, slipping into the relay shack), with no POV slippage or unmotivated omniscience. The restraint in dialogue (almost none, and the old bargeman’s brief admission) suits the piece’s reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person, Lio-centered narration has a distinct, controlled lyricism that fits his philosophical bent and observational patience. Diction (“a rope was a sentence without paper,” “quiet argument between order and drift”) feels grounded in his worldview rather than generic prettiness. Psychic distance is steady, with brief but coherent access to others’ actions and speech without head-hopping. There are a few moments of slightly more omniscient-sounding phrasing, but they don’t disrupt the coherence or emotional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric yet precise, with a consistent lexicon (“season of departures,” “lonesome splendor,” guild vocabulary like “projecting presence”) that feels rooted in this character’s mind. Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both sensuous description and procedural explanation of his method without breaking immersion. There’s no head-hopping; the queen is rendered entirely through observable behavior and reported speech. Rhythm and sentence length modulate with pressure, especially around the projection and reading beats, giving the piece a confident, memorable narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent with Lorian’s sensibility: speculative, tactile, and slightly overwrought in a way that fits a sleepless prince obsessed with hypothesis. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring syntactic patterns (e.g., “hypothesizing about everything”) working as deliberate motifs rather than artifacts. Psychic distance stays stable; we remain inside Lorian’s perceptions without unearned access to others’ interiors. A few lines edge toward authorial abstraction, but they don’t disrupt the established voice or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with figurative language that feels organic to a reflective, hyper-aware firefighter (“sharp as kerosene and grief,” “I wore that coin under my collar like a pulse”). Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding closer under stress without losing clarity, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. Lyric compression during high-pressure beats is plausible for a retrospective narrator and doesn’t undercut immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with the girl’s simple question about how scars sing playing effectively against the narrator’s metaphor-rich internal register.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tied to Mara’s sensibility, with metaphors (“sidereal patience,” “water remembered, not flowing but rehearsing”) that feel like her way of thinking. The prose modulates well between denser description and slightly leaner action without losing its texture. There is no dialogue, but the narrative stance still conveys pressure and subtext through image and interior phrasing. Overall, the voice is distinctive without lapsing into incoherence or generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in phrases like “turning thought into teeth and rotation” and “a wall of condensed starlight that approximates infinity.” Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with an “otherworldly sentimentalist” focalizer and a mythic SF setting. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the narrative distance modulates smoothly between sensory detail and conceptual reflection. At times, the uniform lushness could benefit from sharper rhythmic contrast in high-pressure beats, but it never becomes incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is remarkably consistent and textured, with a calm, contemplative cadence that matches Jonas’s temperament and the “thundering calm” motif. Diction is precise and sensorially rich without obvious register slips, and the narrative stance never claims knowledge beyond Jonas’s perspective. Rhythmic control is strong, especially in how sentences lengthen around meditative or memory-inflected moments and tighten slightly around spectral encounters. A minor check is that the lyric cadence is fairly uniform across the whole piece; a little more modulation at key turns could add extra punch.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with metaphors that grow from Mara’s mechanical and maritime world (“cooled forge,” “guilt makes even duty hesitate”). The perceptual signature—attending to gears, pendulum pauses, corrosion, tidal timing—feels specific to a professional winder haunted by error. The narrative distance stays stable; reflection always hooks to present objects and choices rather than drifting into generalized musing. There is no head-hopping, and the brief move to the widow’s reaction is handled cleanly through observed behavior, not interior leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, with metaphors that feel character-specific rather than generic (“I return to my rows with dirt under my nails…joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates”). Psychic distance is handled smoothly, and the reflective, observant tone fits a cemetery gardener accustomed to both routine and the uncanny. There is no head-hopping or register drift; diction and rhythm stay coherent under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistently colored by Jora’s analytic, skeptical temperament. Phrasing like “numbers that felt like bones warmed in her pocket” and “small machine of meaning” gives the prose a distinctive, intellectually sensuous texture that fits both character and world. Reported dialogue between Jora and the Warden carries clear stakes and subtext even without direct quotations. There are no POV slips or register jolts; the elevated diction feels organic to this character and milieu.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically charged yet controlled, with a strong perceptual signature centered on music, dust, and light; phrases like “as if every tale had been taxed away and burned for heat” feel distinct and intentional. POV remains stable around Mara’s experience, occasionally brushing against a light omniscient feel without causing leakage or confusion. Rhythms and syntax modulate effectively between dense metaphor and clearer functional sentences at structural beats. The piece avoids over-explaining or authorial editorializing, letting the images carry its stance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (safety as mirage, ash as testimony, chair as metronome) that clearly belongs to Lira’s sensibility. Diction and syntax are consistent and confident; figurative language feels organic to the world and character rather than imposed. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the psychic distance holds steady while flexing slightly for backstory. The absence of dialogue is a deliberate choice that suits the somber, interior intensity and keeps the inspectors at a chilling remove.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—dryly sardonic, metaphorically sharp (“spoke as if sanding wood,” “sea…coughing bodies”)—that matches a self-styled sewer philosopher. Narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. Rhythm varies well between denser reflective passages and tighter action beats, and the diction feels plausibly cerebral for someone shaped by a navigator and the ruins of a library district. The only limitation is that Orin’s “abrasive calm” is more asserted than fully dramatized through sharply differentiated dialogue habits.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s reflective sensibility; diction and imagery feel like a unified perceptual signature. Sentences modulate rhythm between lush description and tighter action without losing clarity, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional elevated abstractions fit the quasi-lyric mode rather than reading as register drift. The few lines of dialogue are functional and in-character, underlining method and stakes without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without excess, and clearly aligned with Mira’s sensory, practical mind. Syntax and diction carry a distinct texture—phrases like “she measured it the way she measured salt, by listening” feel both character-true and stylistically sharp. POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping, and reflection is always anchored in present action. A touch more variation in sentence rhythm at the alignment climax could intensify the moment, but the current modulation is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with metaphors (“eyes flat as coins,” “thunder nets”) that feel native to this character’s way of seeing. Psychic distance is well managed, widening for brief reflective context and tightening around key choices without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-distinguishing, especially in the bribe exchange and Sela’s confession. The elevated diction fits the slightly fable-like register and never drifts into an alien register for Maro.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrically precise and confidently controlled, with metaphors (“streetlights daydream,” “kindling for a fire that made no smoke”) that feel both surprising and internally coherent. POV is stably close-third around Mara, with no head-hopping and a clear perceptual signature rooted in how she notices tiny shifts and displaced objects. Rhythm modulates well between long, lush sentences and tighter, declarative turns at key insights. The voice remains consistent even as stakes broaden to the community, which helps the conceptual material feel grounded rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Ilyan’s sensibility, with a distinct rhythm and lexicon that fits the speculative setting. Telepathy is handled cleanly as interior pressure rather than confusing head-hopping, and the Founder’s “voice” is differentiated by its calm, incisive quality. The diction is elevated but believable for a reflective, guilt-haunted witness, and psychic distance is modulated well between sensory immediacy and conceptual reflection. There are no significant stance slips or withholding games; elision (e.g., the prior court scene) is purposeful and coherently filled in via revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, blending mathematical diction with lyrical perception in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Syntax and rhythm vary purposefully; long, meditative sentences slow around reflection, while shorter clauses punch key turns (“Expectation, I realized, was a kind of motion…”). The internal lexicon (“proof by contradiction,” “lemma,” “axioms”) matches the narrator’s mind and never feels like authorial intrusion. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a clear perceptual bias toward light, language, and small acts of care, matching Mira’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; phrases like “thin as a question” and “kindness does not vanish, it changes handwriting” build a recognizable texture without feeling interchangeable. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially Ro’s admission that the marks make his chest hurt, which carries both memory and fear. At times the narration edges toward a more omniscient, essayistic register, and keeping it even more tightly filtered through Mira could heighten distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet grounded, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Maris notices smells, objects, and historical traces. Diction and rhythm stay consistent and appropriate to her cultivated, museum-minded sensibility without drifting into implausible abstraction. The narrative handles time and interiority smoothly; reflective passages are interleaved with concrete choices and do not blur perspective or stance. Absence of dialogue is a deliberate choice that suits the piece’s choral, almost liturgical tone, though a line or two of direct speech could have sharpened status dynamics further.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct texture that marries technical diction (“escapements,” “gear key”) to lyrical phrasing (“slow exhale of low tide,” “teeth of stone”). POV is stable and binds tightly to Orin’s perceptions and competencies; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between denser descriptive lines and shorter, tenser beats as the initiation approaches. A few high-concept sentences approach expository explanation of the stone’s metaphysics but stay just within character-consciousness and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm (“lingering luminance, sickly and seductive, like moonlight filtered through spoiled milk”) that stays coherent throughout. POV control is clean: no head-hopping, no unjustified knowledge, and elision is used only to compress backstory while anchored in present stimuli. The sentence music modulates well between dense description and brisker action at the climax without losing clarity. The brief “dialogue” from the advisor is tonally aligned and functions as part of the same psychic register.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries musical and maritime lexicons (“dubbing the orchard,” “floating harbor,” “restless euphony”). POV distance stays stable; we hover close enough to Leeward to feel his worldview without slipping into unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, tightening during the storm and relaxing in the aftermath. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself carries character and atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses cartographic precision and mythic strangeness (“streets curve like nautilus seams,” “sun that bleaches even fear”). Third-person focalization stays tight to Lira’s sensibility without head-hopping, and the diction level matches the elevated, fable-like mode. Rhythm varies nicely between longer sinuous sentences and impactful shorter turns at key beats (“Behind the loosened slab is a stairwell…”; “the lock splits with a final crack”). The only thing holding it back from the very top is that the voice, while beautiful, remains a touch more omnisciently ornate than intimately character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is tightly aligned with Mara and carries a distinct, slightly austere, historically minded texture that fits her occupation and temperament. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with figurative language that feels chosen rather than automatic. Dialogue is succinct, goal-driven, and differentiates Hadrin’s weary, justificatory stance from Mara’s measured insistence. There are a few moments where the narrator verges on abstract summary, but they don’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches Lira’s sensibility and profession (e.g., “rule and plumb line” shading into metaphors of measurement and footing). Diction stays within a plausible elevated register for a reflective, technically skilled protagonist and does not drift into explanatory omniscience; we never lose track of whose mind filters the scene. Brief dialogue from Beran is economical and status-marked, naturally intensifying conflict without tonal dissonance. Rhythm varies effectively between long, atmospheric sentences and tighter action lines during the confrontation, maintaining legibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct—analytic yet gently lyrical, combining professional precision with sensory awareness in a way that feels particular to a “logical page indexer” underwater. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay close to Maren’s perceptions without gratuitous filter verbs or authorial intrusion. Diction and rhythm remain consistent under pressure, tightening slightly around discoveries and loosening into reflection without losing clarity. The absence of dialogue suits the solitary, interior mode and keeps the tonal cohesion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture of image-making (“ink fish,” “lightless light,” “stained dawn”) that feels like a unified sensibility rather than a stitched list. Third-person focalization stays stable around Mira with a fairy-tale-omniscient flavor that suits the piece’s mythic tone, and psychic distance is controlled. Rhythm varies well across sentences; the prose compresses large actions but keeps emotional clarity at key beats like the splitting into flame and paper. Occasionally the narration feels more like an authorial storyteller than Mira’s own perception, but that choice is coherent rather than sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent: technical lexicon (“probabilistic lock,” “perturbation theory,” “waveguide”) sits naturally beside visceral and imagistic language. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; even the metaphysical glimpse is framed as a perception enabled by his condition and apparatus. Rhythm varies well between longer lyric sentences and brisker technical or temporal markers, matching pressure. A few abstractions verge on density, but they remain grounded enough in concrete images that the voice never blurs into generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a close focalization through Mara, with just enough room for the pilgrim’s mythic aura. Diction and imagery (“stones began to drink the last light,” “language nobody could complete,” “shy comet”) give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, and the small bits of dialogue match the established tone. The lyric compression feels deliberate rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently colored by Mara’s sensibility—mechanical imagery, archival metaphors, and a measured, careful syntax that fits a professional eraser of histories. Lyrical density is high but pattern-consistent, and modulation at the key turn (“plain sentences that did not varnish loss”) cleverly mirrors her ethical shift in diction. Occasional broader statements (about the fabricated scenes “slid into minds with the ease of moonlight on water”) stay within her plausible lexicon and perspective. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext and choice rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and textured, with Lena’s sensibility—attuned to regret, objects, and small silences—coloring the narrative. Sentence rhythms vary in a controlled way, from the lush opening (“Mist stitched the storm-worn…”) to leaner beats in the exchange itself, matching emotional tempo. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext (“as if agreeing to stand in the same silence”; the boy’s “my mother owned one just like it”). The voice is elevated yet plausible for this focalization and never slips into explanatory omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and shows a clear perceptual signature—Theo’s world is filtered through navigation metaphors and coastal detail. Diction is elevated but feels plausibly like free indirect style for a contemplative, once-professional navigator rather than intrusive authorial commentary. Lita’s brief dialogue sounds natural and distinct in age and function, and her presence sharpens rather than dilutes voice. Occasional high-register phrases slightly stretch his plausible lexicon under stress but never break the spell or cause distance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, mixing noir cynicism with speculative strangeness (“smelled like ozone and second chances”). Diction and rhythm feel character-specific and modulate effectively from hardboiled quips to more lyrical perception around the lake. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; even the traveler’s broader knowledge is relayed through dialogue. The stylistic choices feel unified rather than stitched from genre tics.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically rich yet coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature (cosmic analogies, bodily sensations rendered through elemental metaphors). POV is stable and access to Mira’s interior is well-controlled; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and diction are distinctive and mostly well-modulated, though the lushness is fairly constant rather than flexing more sharply with pressure spikes. Overall, the voice feels confident and specific enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is singular and consistent, blending occult lexicon (“onyx-ink cartomancer,” “spread directly onto the saucer”) with bodily, postpartum immediacy. Diction and imagery feel plausibly like this specific narrator’s mind rather than generic lyricism, and the register doesn’t wobble. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both intimate feeling and mythic framing without confusion. Patterned elision and compression are taught from the first line and paid off cleanly at the glade and the closing tablecloth image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady and texturally distinct: lyrical but controlled, with recurring stitch/tear imagery that feels intentional rather than mechanical. POV remains cleanly in Mara’s perception except where Lio’s single line of dialogue naturally carries his seriousness as “the final heir.” Rhythm modulates well, with denser, more incantatory lines in reflective beats and tighter, clearer phrasing around key actions (sewing, confession, opening the hatch). There is no head-hopping or register drift that undercuts the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in its metaphors (“whispering hush,” “gray pollen,” “vibrant hush”) that matches Amina’s unusual worldview. Occasional glances into Toma’s interiority are brief and plausibly read as free indirect, not disruptive head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between slower, contemplative lines and more clipped action during the tremor and escape. A few formulations flirt with abstract lyricism, but they stay anchored enough in concrete perception to avoid feeling like generic narrator commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and character-specific: metaphor choices and technical focus clearly belong to a lock sentinel who thinks in mechanisms and angles. The “winking hush” tone—wry, conspiratorial, and attentive to textures of metal and light—holds across the piece and modulates appropriately as pressure rises. Elision is minimal and legible; the POV doesn’t overreach knowledge or head-hop. The only minor limitation is that the lushness of diction occasionally smooths over what might be sharper shifts in emotional distance under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, vivid, and clearly filtered through Eren’s obsessions with numbers, sequences, and patterns; images like “numbers in prayer” and “borrowed dawn” form a distinct perceptual signature. Lyricism is high but remains in-character and in-world rather than generic poeticizing. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Marel’s lines practical and goal-oriented in contrast to the more visionary narration. Psychic distance stays controlled, and the narrative never assumes knowledge beyond what can be reasonably inferred from Eren’s vantage.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (technical photographic detail braided with metaphor, like “silver salts at the edge of revelation”). Diction and rhythm stay consistent with a reflective, educated poet without slipping into academic abstraction or losing emotional immediacy. Free-indirect access is clean, and the few spoken lines from Lysa feel in-character and subtextually aligned with the thematic work. Under peak beats (father’s note, final descent), the voice intensifies without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is confident, slightly ornate, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in Lysander’s blend of philosophy and tactics. Phrasings like “diplomatically fierce” and “drive an argument to the marrow” feel character-inflected rather than generically fancy. Dialogue is sparse but apt, conveying status and subtext without flattening into exposition. The elevated diction occasionally approaches uniformity of register across narration and implied thought, but it suits the stylized civic-fantasy mode.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice has a strong, coherent lyrical texture—“sirens braid with birdsong,” “pockets full of ash,” “shelves bent like ribs”—that suits Len’s sensibility and the story’s aims. Diction and syntax are controlled and varied, with rhythms that can compress time and then linger on a charged image without losing clarity. POV distance remains stable, hovering close to Len while allowing lightly omniscient, metaphor-rich narration that feels like an extension of his poetic mind rather than an external essayist. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (Mara’s question about what else could fit in the tin) and advancing both relationship and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Lio’s musical and temporal sensibility (e.g., understanding compasses “by rhythm”). Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with the numinous setting, and the prose modulates well from wistful description to more charged beats in the hidden room. There is no head-hopping or unjustified stance shift; the narrative confidence stays matched to what Lio can know or infer. Occasional high-flown lines flirt with overrichness but never tip into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature: fusing empirical language with mythic, sensory detail in a way that reflects Tavo’s mindset. POV is stable and distance is well-managed; we stay close enough to feel his skepticism and wonder without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, carrying dense imagery while remaining legible. The voice feels singular and confident, not generic fantasy-poetic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, syntactically varied, and consistently colored by the narrator’s sensibility; metaphors like “sky was washed into cerulean regret” feel motivated by character as much as by style. POV control is tight and stable, with no head-hopping or implausible knowledge intrusions. Sera’s speech pattern—slow, measured—reads distinct from the narrator’s lyricism, even with limited dialogue. A demanding editor might pare one or two flourish-heavy constructions, but the overall voice is strong and market-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, matching the "quietly driven" protagonist. However, the reliance on summary creates a distant narrative filter that keeps the reader observing Lina rather than inhabiting her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and rhythmic ("cooling after the torch"), fitting the scavenger-poet persona. It only falters at the climax, where the narration imposes an abstract interpretation ("barking at lies") that distances the reader from the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally strong and atmospheric, but suffers from significant register slips and tense inconsistencies driven by prompt adherence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but relies heavily on "filter" verbs and abstract descriptions of silence and prophecy that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited is locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: neutron-star cooling metaphors, signal-to-noise vocabulary, tactile nullity of wing dust. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action; no head-hop. Register stays within her lexicon; “accretion stopped” is character-bound, not authorial flourish. Final paragraph modulates to a quieter cadence that mirrors earned humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries a glassblower’s perceptual signature—light, refraction, molten obedience—and rhythmic control (“bright and obedient, into a pane”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence; lyric compression is consistent and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person focalization clings to Orren’s sailor-honed perception—rhythm in bones, wave crest mime—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax is crisp, maritime-tinged (“trimmed sails”) yet precise under pressure. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is legible only through her gestures and slate strokes. Final paragraph modulates into lyrical ascent without losing control, achieving Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    First-person undertaker voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: coast that has no coast, sea pressing with “patient, chased stillness,” catalog numbers stitched onto bones. Syntax mirrors pressure—long clauses that buckle into fragments when the suit groans. Patterned elision (“I should have thrown it back… yet”) is taught early and pays off in the final refusal to relinquish the lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under depth but diction stays within Marek’s lexicon (“smear of wax from the books”).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays locked to Amira; perceptual signature is tactile (coins counted “by touch,” clay smell). Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during the raid; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic (“Whoever Helped”) and carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person hovers at a consistent psychic distance, filtering perception through Mara’s camera-trained eye; patterned elision (“revealing through breathing changes”) is taught early and paid off at closure without register drift or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice is consistent, compressed, and rhythmic (“the river below sounded like pages turning”). Hyperbolic geometry and retrocognition are handled with confident ellipsis that teaches the reader to trust the pattern. No dialogue means no voice-convergence risk. A single filter-verb cluster (“I felt… I understood… I heard”) slightly dulls the peak beat inside the maze.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: “dust rises like a curtain” is her metaphor, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches Mara’s synesthetic ear; rhythm swells and contracts with auroral light. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mara’s artisan lexicon—“sliver of brass,” “housings for other ears”—though one clause (“the impact of memories was that they could either rot you or forge you”) edges toward aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)

Syntax flexes from long painterly sentences to the staccato of the final choice, mirroring heartbeat shift. Distinctive without mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited voice carries glassblower precision: “molten silica into panels as thin as pages.” Rhythm modulates—declamatory cadence during narration, short reflective fragments when guilt surfaces.

Syntax tightens under stress: fragments when the file is opened, longer breaths in the library. No head-hopping; boy’s interior stays opaque, as required. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for stunt-double idiom, but it occurs in a low-pressure beat and does not contaminate climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice sustains a lyric-archaic register that never drifts into pastiche; diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) is consistent and motivated by the narrator’s cartographic synesthesia. Perceptual signature is sharp: the POV notices what can or cannot be plotted—silence, pressure, aftertaste—while filtering out conventional emotion. Compression and elision (“I spoke in a slow cadence of omissions”) are taught early and paid off at closure. One syntactic monotony risk: repeated adjective-noun stacks (“storm-tossed ridge fort,” “wind-carved chapel”) but the rhythm modulates under final pressure, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight stays locked to J-17’s tactile, procedural diction—“aligned broom bristles by touch,” “salt cart clicks.” Syntax is clean yet subtly musical, mirroring the violin’s escalating resonance without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—aurora “spilled over the ridgeline in quiet curtains,” radiosonde balloons “heavier than the tongue.” Syntax lengthens and breathes under fever, then tightens during confession.

One clause drifts toward textbook—“truths behave like pressure systems”—but the surrounding texture keeps it afloat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice is razor-specific: “hear my own eyelids click,” “throat of brick,” “worrying a badge as if it were a rosary.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments, sensory stacking—yet stays readable. Perceptual signature (skeptical salvage-logic) never slips. Radio voices are distinct without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person lyric voice is consistent, textured, and cadence-controlled: “paper softened into loam,” “river tasted of black glass.” Perceptual signature—cataloguing decay, measuring time by rot—remains distinct under pressure. No head-hopping; compression is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Liora’s musical perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“kalimba like heartbeat,” “leaves seemed to lean in”). Syntax breathes with scene—long phrases for ascent, clipped fragments at totality. No head-hop; astronomer is externally observed. Dialogue is minimal but voice-differentiated (Mara’s whisper vs Liora’s two-note answer). A hair below 9 only because one sentence edges toward poetic overreach: “world clicked into a dim blue hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual syntax: “felt vibrations as if they were sentences,” “bronze dust,” “concrete remembered the loom’s rhythm.” Rhythm modulates—long clauses for slow listening, clipped fragments at the pin. No head-hopping; diction stays within her antiquarian lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; voice sustains singularity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is tight: Lian notices light bounce off cookie glass, ink smell on stainless steel—details only a fortune writer would weigh. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under beam-switching pressure. No head-hop; Mara’s dialogue is spare, distinct from Lian’s interior lyric. Register stays within plausible lexicon for a bilingual kitchen worker turned cryptographer.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited locks to Selo with priestly diction—“loop pedal priest,” “rhetorical devices”—and perceptual signature that hears silence as lanterns. Compression is taught early (“decorates with silence”) and paid off in the deliberate pause that ends the piece. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior surfaces only through externalized flickers and speech. Rhythm modulates: looping cadence under pressure, then low precise litany, final fade.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, percussive rhythm—“glass spire...upturned hush...thinner music”—that modulates into the dawn’s bright release without register drift.

No dialogue, so voice carries every beat; compression like “chronologically homesick” is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual signature: physics-of-gravity metaphors, sensor-repair idiom, and temporal loop compression. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during breath-held beats, then widens at closure. No head-hopping; younger-self apparitions are externalized memory, not POV breaches. Distinctive syntax (“periodically eternal”) is taught early and paid off. Clean 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s tactile cognition; perceptions are filtered through cane taps, floor vibrations, fingertip threads. Syntax lengthens under pressure—“vibrations skitter like startled mice”—then fractures with the scoring beats, mirroring the reversal. No head-hopping; Kerrin’s drum enters only as observed vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries a meteorologist’s perceptual signature—barometer-ticking breath, wind-shift literacy—without ever slipping into data-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice carries a roadside poet’s compressed lyricism—“highways hummed like tuning forks”—without purple drift. Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional temperature; short beats under pressure (“I untied one knot”) give way to longer reflective coils. Perceptual signature is consistent: every noticed detail (dust taste, clay glow) filters through the speaker’s hunger for temporal texture. No head-hopping or register slippage occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—every sentence tuned for pitch, vibration, hush. Syntax lengthens and softens during the bowing beat (“so softly that the first sound is almost imagined”), then releases into shorter percussive clauses as waves slap. No head-hopping; Jory’s interior remains opaque, as etiquette under the hush demands. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice distinction clause is waived; narrative voice carries all subtext without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person voice is textured, synesthetic, and consistent: “bottled honey,” “cracked compass,” “lantern under his ribs.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under static crackle, mirroring pressure.

    Third-person limited stays inside Mara’s perceptual orbit: “she liked the place because…” selects salty breeze and smudged rosters. Syntax lengthens under feeling (“cautious and exuberant at once”) then tightens during proposal. No head-hopping; Eli’s interior accessed only via blush, laugh, admission—external cues Mara can see. Distinct maritime-commerce diction (“squeeze tariffs,” “longshoreman”) differentiates her voice from Eli’s softer librarian register.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Sava’s sculptor perception—she hears “ringing” fruit, smells “rain on stone,” and reads glass ribs as press-forms.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual signature—patterns, numbers, reed-memory. Syntax mirrors her patient inventiveness: long rhythmic sentences that “count” breaths.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate carries a hushed, percussive cadence—sapphire, copper, click—that mirrors Lio’s methodical stealth. Syntax compresses under pressure (“He cached… he traced…”) then elongates at the dawn beat, teaching the reader the pattern. No head-hop; child’s interiority is implied through sensory spill, not ventriloquized. Distinct perceptual signature holds: every noun is something he could pocket, weigh, or smell.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-limited voice maintains perceptual signature of a recorder: barometric numbers, runoff angles, “circuitously sincere” diction that circles every direct claim. Syntax lengthens and vines during vegetal episodes, then tightens when she scrubs—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No head-hop; the boy’s nod is surface-only, filtered through her surprise. Compressed storm grammar (“clouds still ripping apart”) teaches the reader to accept lyric elision early.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-limited clings to Sera’s ear, yet Lan’s infected double-voice ruptures cadence exactly where possession peaks.

Voice stays consistent while registering the micro-shift from ennui to reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: “air tasted,” “drain gurgle like a throat,” “pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence”—all her synesthetic bias. Syntax tightens under pressure: clipped clauses when agents enter, longer braid when she writes margins. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt,” “she thought”) could have been cut, but voice remains distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person stays tight to Eli’s perceptual filter: “smelled salt, then old varnish, then something like rain” sequences attention the way a patient listener would catalogue. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical cadences for discovery, clipped fragments (“The needle vanished”) for finality. No head-hopping; the dome’s “eye” is metaphor Eli would plausibly craft. One tiny slip: “gloomy cheerfulness was his habit” edges toward authorial diagnosis, but immediate bodily payoff (“wiped his damp cheeks”) restores interior ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Ira’s perceptual filter—she reads crowds, lantern reflections, rope tension. Syntax is supple, shifting from long carnival sentences to staccato night beats: “She flashed the chip… walked the decks.” No head-hopping; Vell’s realization is rendered only through observable action. One register drift: “heritage upgrades” sounds like Council brochure, not Ira’s idiom, but it appears in exposition, not interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature—chemical smells, shutter clicks, starch-ink logic—no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, shortens during strip reveals; diction carries scientific precision yet yields to lyrical compression at climax.

One clause of elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is avoided; prose earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature blends perfumer heritage (“molecules carrying memory”) with salvage-tech precision (“gauge hit its last trembling bars”).

No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal monologue stays concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hover stays tight to Ila’s perceptual warp: “paths on it shifted like threads seeking a needle.” Syntax loosens into incantatory cadence during sleepwalking passages, then tightens back for dawn logistics. No dialogue, so voice carries all status cues; dockhands’ deference is shown through their obedient return with dyed spools. The risk of lyric overwriting is flirted with but controlled—each figurative burst is anchored to textile or tidal motion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited clings to Liora’s perceptual filter: noticing voids before beauty, reading stonemason’s sun as map instruction. Syntax lengthens during excavation, shortens during collapse, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her craftsman lexicon. Father Sava’s sparse dialogue carries subtext of institutional fear without voice bleed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice carries a forensic-archivist’s precision—”calibration tables,” “postal membrane”—yet modulates into wistful memory of grandmother’s whistle. Rhythm tightens under pressure: long sensory clauses collapse into staccato invention “M. Return.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. One clause drifts toward ornate (“citywide skin, still whispering truths”) but stays within allowable lyric lift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter—starpaths as thread-count, beacon tones as stitched knots—producing a distinct textile astronomy idiom. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under threat (“nudged the orrery half a tooth”). Kest’s coded banter and the lieutenant’s blunt demand carry separate cadences; no head-hopping. Free-indirect thought (“singing planets”) sells the foolish mask without voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lani’s perceptual signature—languages tasted as fear, coral ridges read as maps, “lotus-hearted ache” as tonal compass. No head-hopping; captain and liaison are heard only through her ear and radio static. Rhythm modulates: long liquid cadence for atrium calm, clipped naval phrases when decrypting. Diction stays within a translator’s lexicon without academic drift. Final image relinquishes metaphor to object, voice quieting into ache.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mara’s perceptual quirks—she notices cider-house rot by how color would cling to it. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under decision (“She bowed… laughing again”). No head-hopping; dream logic justifies compressed elisions. Voice remains distinct even when diction elevates, because elevated perception is her professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—sound is directional, color “seeps,” solvent “softens only what was false.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with echo duration, creating rhythmic mimicry.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person entomologist voice carries a perceptual signature that filters every detail through professional noticing: humidity vs. lens clarity, larval admiration as cover, butterfly-wing syntax.

Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Lio’s “How many spots on this ladybug?” carries code subtext without explanatory bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice carries a hushed, liturgical rhythm—long sentences that breathe like chant, then shorten under stress (“I steadied myself… counting steps, breathing in fours”). Diction stays within the caretaker’s monastic lexicon; no academic register intrudes. The perceptual signature is custodial: he notices cracks, dust, stem sheen, and the “sweet and poisonous” air rather than grand vistas. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A; internal voice remains coherent and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature—“scripts the way musicians read scores,” “script kinked and knotted”—is linguist-specific and sustained. Syntax flexes with pressure: long clauses for dread, staccato beats for ritual steps. No head-hopping; when Ilyon speaks Sava we hear it through Mara’s sensory filter. The near-omission of dialogue keeps voice pure; the single line of Sava rings as ritual action, not conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: resin threads are “tiny dashes and knots,” council voices “seemed less certain.” Syntax lengthens under argument, shortens under discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Milo’s analytical filter: variables, diagonals, probabilities. Syntax mirrors performer rhythm—long conjunct sentences for story-telling, staccato options during rescue. Distinct diction (“sea-yellowed,” “ribbed tunnel of tin”) avoids generic lyricism.

Voice modulates under stress—sentence fragments appear as dawn approaches—yet remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Liora’s ear: “the corridor answered in overlapping taps.” Diction is precise—corridor echo cartographer, salt fog, ceramic plates—without slipping into catalog voice. Rhythm accelerates during the unlock sequence: short clauses mimic staccato taps, then lengthen into murmuring plates. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction bullet is waived; internal monologue avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering thought as sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person voice is metallic, methodical, frost-bitten: “my breath sounded like filings in a bell” is a perceptual signature that recurs in wax, bronze, and auroral light. Syntax lengthens during delicate rope-work, then shortens under furnace heat, mirroring thermal stress.

Compression (“snowmelt ardor”) is taught early and pays off in the final warm droplets, keeping lyric elision legible.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice is sustained, lyrical yet grounded: “joke with a blade hidden in the punchline” is idiosyncratic and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature (“catalog the astral orchard,” “filing moments like specimens”) is curator-specific and rhythmic. Compression (“star-fruit fall upward”) teaches lyric pattern early and holds. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register stays within Mara’s scholarly lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.

Rhythm accelerates during corridor collapse, then exhales at dawn, matching emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)

No head-hopping; every metaphor is POV-plausible (“hammered repose,” “ripple-mark mapkeeper”).

Voice modulation under peak stress is controlled, earning high band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)

No head-hopping; Jalen’s interiority is implied only through antlered snort and catching arm. Compression (“she poured her ink… cracked each prism”) is taught early by prism-light play and pays off in the final monochrome moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice carries a methodical cadence—ledger, calipers, column/row—that mirrors the narrator’s perceptual limits. Selective noticing (scent of pond water, double knot) stays inside face-blind bias. Compression in lines like “lance the air with my pencil tip” fuses action and metaphor without breaking idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—coastlines, isobars, and archival marginalia color every observation.

Compression is taught early: "facts felt like earplugs" cues the reader to accept later ellipses. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent—sound memory overrides visual whenever stress peaks. Dialogue is minimal but idiomatic: Marla’s shrugged "nothing left to steal out here, only echoes" sounds like quarry foreman shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lingers inside Nerin’s perceptual circuitry: copper bands feel like clay dust, cloud-parchment like unread tablets.

    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s synesthetic chemist ear—“naming catalysts like instruments”—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in ravine, staccato lab list at station, matching emotional cadence. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. One clause drifts toward authorial certainty (“she understood that leaving and joining were the same motion”), but it is anchored in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice sustains a hushed, moon-lit cadence; perceptual signature notices blanks, catalog numbers, photons.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lingers inside Safi’s synesthetic perception—“tasting the way other people listened”—a consistent perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens when he absorbs memories, then fractures into clause-spikes as shame scrapes him raw. No head-hopping; even the soldier’s weep is filtered through Safi’s bodily reaction. One clause drifts toward elevated register: “conceptual repricing of mercy,” but context justifies the chef’s meta-awareness after absorbing centuries of regret.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: astronomical clock dials, choral scores, dust scent. Syntax lengthens into catalog rhythm when she names farmers in their home languages, mirroring her bridge-building impulse. No head-hopping; even the elevator’s speech arrives through the tube’s rasp filtered by her ear. Occasional lofted diction (“lonely grammar asking to be answered”) is earned by her librarian-poet vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Nira’s perceptual signature—helix metaphors, star triangulation, engineer’s pulse count. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, staccato solder turns for action. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. One filter-verb cluster (“she saw the moon fractured…”) is voice-motivated through the periscope lens. Patterned elision—“strangers were memories”—is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Jun’s nostrils and wrist movements; perceptual signature is consistent—rain has a “signature,” wardens’ laughter carries sulfur.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual filter—water flow, engine hum, arrow warmth. Syntax stretches and compresses with gravity inversion: long clauses while floating, short beats at touchdown. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Diction remains within pilot lexicon; no corporate register drift. Psychic distance narrows in the hollow until only heartbeat and drip remain.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person voice is crisp, technical, slightly haunted; perceptual signature filters world through airflow, pressure, circuitry—never slips into generic noir; compression and metaphor stay controlled, rhythm accelerates with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s synesthetic idiom—tasting brass, hearing greens—creates a consistent perceptual signature that modulates under stress: short, chiming clauses when the hush clenches, longer aurora-lit sentences during release. No head-hopping; distance remains tight first-person. Prose rhythm mirrors bell sequence: controlled, iterative, then blooming. Occasional elevated diction (“oscillating repose”) is justified by the guild-artist POV and does not drift into corporate register.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-limited voice carries a hush-inflected syntax—long breathy clauses that mimic flute phrases, then short plosive beats (“She stepped through”). Perceptual signature is acoustic: sound sinks, thunder is held like a held breath; no other character would notice this way. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s dialogue is spare, flint-eyed, distinct from her denser interior. Compression taught early—“sound did not travel so much as sink”—pays off in the frozen world’s ash-cloud silence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is printer-poetic: “misregistered prints,” “topaz dust,” syntax of metal and ink. Perceptual signature stays consistent—Kestrel notices kerning, starlight thinning, halo hum.

Diction (“frozen scree,” “stamped copper”) is courier-specific, not generic fantasy gloss. The lamplighter’s dialogue is spare, regional, and goal-driven (offering bread), distinguishing him from Mara's more measured educator cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries a precise, slightly numbed perceptual signature—frost “filigree,” “shifted hush,” “sealed jar”—that stays consistent under stress. No dialogue from the narrator; Lio’s speech is ritual-formal but distinct enough to mark role, not personhood.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers at Yara’s perceptual edge: “raveling silence,” “resin light,” syntax mirroring shuttle rhythm. No head-hopping; Jun’s arrival is filtered through Yara’s mute attention.

Distinct voice modulation between quiet vigilance and the final, almost whispered capitulation to anonymity.

One clause of academic diction (“Conceptual Repricing”-like phrasing in reflection) nicks the 9+ gate.

    Third-person lyric stays tight to Lysa’s spinner-perception: verbs like “braided,” “glimmers,” “netted” mirror her craft. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath—song-lines stretch, then snap into short clauses when night fights back. No head-hopping; chemists’ fear is filtered through Lysa’s ear. The diction never exceeds her nettle-and-cradle lexicon; even “cinnabar” is introduced as loom-part, not mineral lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marin’s perceptual signature—sound of a cough as confession, lamplight like honey—without head-hopping.

Voice remains distinct even at peak stress, earning its place near the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—sound of nails, smell of tar, crab-shadow drag—without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: she “reads patterns” in vellum shards and notices ozone scent because her livelihood depends on ink.

The rhythmic final sentence—“the city felt answerable”—is earned by the voice’s prior compression.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual filter—wind grit, bell harmonics, light shards—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and shortens with rotational speed; diction is precise yet musical (“slow blue archive,” “bronze shims”).

Compression (“cold as diagnosis”) is voice-motivated, taught early, and paid off when water surges.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice is taut, coastal, and lamp-lit: “the silence shone so hard it felt like a blade in my throat.” Syntax mirrors tidal surge—long briny clauses, then abrupt chips of mortar. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays lantern-bright and salt-bitter. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction is outside Lysa’s lexicon in this evaluator’s notes only, not in the story text—so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers close to Liora’s perceptual filter: she notices intervals between cricket calls, reads ripples with fingertips—idiosyncratic, not touristic. Syntax lengthens during ritual, then compresses at dawn (“they found only a brook…”), mirroring tension release. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“terrestrially cosmic”) is borderline but consistent with the character’s arcane vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: “she saw her own hands as tools” is internal sight, not authorial label.

Diction—“unyoke,” “moon paths,” “basalt cold enough to dull”—is precise, never ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays lashed to Mara’s perceptual signature: sounds return “softer, like testimony after cross-examination.” Syntax lengthens under stress then snaps short for the upload beat, mirroring her pulse. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a transit investigator’s lexicon. Only one tiny drift: “oil” simile for Kellan’s voice is familiar, but it’s brief and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—metallic smells, prison corridors, weather-sensitive joints—without leakage.

Occasional elevated diction (“equations drawn in steel and paint”) momentarily lifts above her intern register but reads as her private exhilaration, not narrator inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person syntax mimics escapement ticks—long sentences coil, then release in short beats (“I tore a strip”).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature—air recyclers hiss like surf, photos glint like candle ghosts. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short clauses when she lifts: “she grips a handrail, laughing soundlessly.” No head-hopping; Lio’s dialogue is spare, adolescent, distinct from her interior cadence.

    Rowan’s perceptual signature—attentive to unsaid rhythms, scarred paper, ambient breath—shapes every sentence. Syntax mirrors his focus: long, liquid clauses for observation; short, blunt phrases for decisions (“He would drive”). Voice remains consistent even in stress (no register drift during climax).

Syntax modulates with emotion: short clauses during tension (“She grips a handrail”), lyrical flow during revelation. Voice is distinct—“helium lung,” “candle ghosts”—without slipping into exposition or head-hopping. Lio’s brief dialogue carries weight through simplicity, contrasting Mara’s internal complexity without convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Amina notices rhythm in mineral glints and bug pulses, hears “hush under every sound.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences in contemplation; clipped urgency during tremors (“lift the lantern higher”). Voice remains consistent even in lyric mode; elision (e.g., skipping how she finances orchards) is purposeful and paid off by closure’s focus on practice over proof. No head-hopping; Toma’s perspective is externalized through action, not interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.7)
    First-person POV is stable, deeply interior, and voice-specific: syntax varies rhythmically (“every gate became a mouth clamped shut”), diction blends poetic precision (“winking hush”) with technical lexicon (“brass tumblers,” “inner tumblers”), and perceptual bias filters every detail (noticing lock mechanics over city chaos). Elision is purposeful—the revolution’s logistics compressed into “angles”—and taught early. Under stress, prose tightens (“fingers... rolled a thin pick”) without losing texture. No head-hopping; even Captain Orven is rendered strictly through the sentinel’s wary observation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Eren notices math in eel turns, light in dust, tension in rope—not emotions but systems. Syntax mirrors his cognition: clauses coil like eels, sentences balance precision (“primes and spirals and ratios”) with lyricism (“borrowed dawn that never quite became day”). Voice remains controlled under stress; even during the sea-walking climax, diction stays concrete (“guided his eels along the helix line”). Elision is purposeful—backstory compressed into sensory cues (vial, rope)—and pays off in closure’s reweighted silence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Voice is exquisitely calibrated: lyrical but precise, poetic yet embodied (“second hand crawl like an insect along a rim of light”). Perceptual signature is consistent—a censored poet notices gaps, halftones, seams, pauses. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during exposure, fluid cadence in reflection. No head-hopping; even Lysa’s dialogue serves the narrator’s focalization. Elision is taught early (ink-barred stanzas) and paid off in the photographic metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.7)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Lysander’s perceptive, mechanically inflected consciousness (“brass ribs,” “hiss of valves”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical during observation (“sunlight differently”), taut during fencing (“clash rang like a cymbal”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Veller’s “polished” courtliness versus Lysander’s etiquette-as-weaponry. Syntax mirrors thought: complex during deduction, fragmented in combat. No head-hopping; even the council’s arrival is seen through Lysander’s eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Len’s poetic sensibility (“light had cracked and learned to sing”). Voice modulates with emotional intensity—lyrical in reflection, urgent during riots—without losing rhythmic coherence. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; even elevated phrases (“fracture could shine”) feel earned by his identity as a haiku-seller. No head-hopping; Mara’s interiority is inferred only through action and dialogue, preserving focal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Lio’s musician’s perception: compasses “flicker in short panicked arcs,” piano strings “hum in sympathy.” Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for wistful observation, terse phrases for action (“He climbed... threaded... played”). Perceptual signature is distinct: he reads the station’s rhythms like sheet music. No head-hopping; even the courier exists only as functional pressure on Lio’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Tavo’s empirically whimsical perception—e.g., “weighing shadows on a fish scale,” “timing prayers with a cracked stopwatch.” Voice modulates under pressure: prose grows more lyrical during the waking dream (“branches made of remembered faces”), then sharpens into action (“hands already digging”). Syntax varies purposefully—long, sensory sentences for atmosphere; short, imperative clauses for urgency. No head-hopping; even the crowd’s voices are heard through Tavo’s ears. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon: poetic but grounded, never academic.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person POV maintains consistent perceptual signature: noticing weathered textures, maritime decay, and chromatic nuances. Voice modulates rhythmically—long, lyrical sentences during reflection; fragmented phrases during shipboard tension (“salt wind rifled my hair”). Prose embodies the narrator’s grief without head-hopping or register drift. Lace instructions are woven into narration seamlessly, avoiding exposition.
