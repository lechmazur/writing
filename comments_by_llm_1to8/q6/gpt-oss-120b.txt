  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Mara's perceptual filter (neutron-star researcher attending to decay) is consistent. Diction remains character-specific without head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally elevates into abstract register ("preprocess reality," "chorus of disturbances") that feels slightly academic rather than embodied under greenhouse-tending pressure. No dialogue appears; the voice modulates with observation but lacks rhythmic tightening at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic ("trembling," "steady," "drifting resonance") without character-particular texture. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("scorched testament," "steadily adaptive," "purpose she had been seeking") that feels authored rather than filtered through Elya's lived experience under pressure. Psychic distance stays consistent but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation that would reflect her emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the opening anchors Mara's survivor body and silk-scarf detail. Perceptual signature is present (calloused hands, pulse of residual heat), yet diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("manifestation of silence made audible," "tapestry of sound") that sits slightly above the embodied survivor voice established early. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The weeks-later summary shifts psychic distance without clear motivation, softening the ending's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Marlow notices arches, water, and light without character-particular bias. Diction frequently elevates into lyric register ("phosphorescent ink that floated like ghosts," "each beam of light a promise") that feels authorial rather than emerging from an undertaker's lexicon. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays consistent, but voice lacks the textural specificity and rhythm control under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer, and diction is consistent—though it leans toward elevated, abstract register ("amplified quiet," "gently persistent rhythm," "surge of hope that rose like a tide") that can drift from immediate perception. No head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance is controlled but uniform; the narrative never tightens into close embodied sensation during peak moments (midnight runs, elder meetings). Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices light, sound, and emotional labels without character-specific bias or selective attention shaped by her role or background. Dialogue is absent, so no voice distinction or subtext is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, and diction ("pilgrim of sparks," "breathing worlds") carries consistent texture. However, perceptual signature is generic-lyric rather than character-specific: Milo notices in abstract, elevated terms ("symphony of healed hearts," "lattice of glowing potential") that could belong to any spiritual narrator. Register shifts into label-speak ("unused love," "reservoir of unused love") without embodied cost. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under pressure to test voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register incongruous with moment-to-moment perception ("mutable sanctuary," "quaking reverie," "trembling fabric that resonated with both loss and renewal"). Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Mara's way of noticing does not reveal distinct priorities or blind spots. Sentence rhythm is uniform, with many clauses opening "The [noun]" or "Mara [verb]," creating mechanical cadence. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric-elevated register ("rusted cathedral," "forgotten throat," "silent pledge"). Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices what the plot requires without character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("staggering grace," "thrum with possibility") that feels more authorial than focalizer-native, and the closing line's metaphor stack ("freedom can be forged from the most unexpected tools") reads as theme summary rather than lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("battered yet marvelous," "quiet affirmation") but lacks perceptual signature tied to Mara's specific profession or experience. Distance is stable, but the narration recycles template stems—"She understood that," "She felt the," "Mara watched"—across multiple beats. Voice does not modulate under pressure; the cadence remains uniformly elevated regardless of scene intensity. No dialogue appears, so subtext and goal-driven speech cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.4)
    Voice is uniform across narration and characters, relying on elevated lyricism ("liquid dusk," "soft sighs of forgotten travelers," "luminous disbelief") that never modulates under pressure. The conductor's single rose and midnight lilies arrive without dialogue or gestural subtext, flattening any interpersonal texture. Perceptual signature is absent—Lira notices everything with equal, ornate attentiveness. Purposeful elision is not taught; the piece withholds mechanics (how flowers unlock things) only to assert them later without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric ("weighty lightness," "liturgy," "tapestry of purpose"), voice-consistent but occasionally slips into abstract register ("nurture the fragile equilibrium") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; no embodied micro-noticing that distinguishes Mara's glassblower eye from any contemplative artisan. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing (repeated "weighty lightness") support the accumulative design, but the effect is more decorative than pressure-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice carries a consistent lyric register but lacks a perceptual signature specific to a stunt double under stress. Diction ("half-whispering," "firmly adaptive," "trembling certainty") recycles compound modifiers that blur rather than sharpen. No dialogue present to assess. POV remains stable first-person, though internal access is abstract rather than embodied. The prose reads as curated rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("pebble-shore oracle," "phantom serpent," "rain-kissed iron") strives for lyric elevation but drifts into stock poeticism ("ambered hush" × 4, "marbled hush" × 4) that flattens voice particularity. Perceptual signature is minimal; the oracle's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting the meditative tone, but the elevated register remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with stakes. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to the robot's perceptions. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated abstraction ("mundane mysticism," "intangible patterns of its own code") that sits uneasily with the mechanical POV. The robot's internal voice occasionally shifts into essayistic register ("a simple, honest invitation to keep cleaning"), which reads more like narrator commentary than robot cognition. Perceptual signature is present (magnetic fingertips, sensor data, processing loops) but underutilized in peak beats, where thought becomes generic rather than machine-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is ornate and uniform ("origami," "phosphorescence," "sentinel," "ambiguously clear" repeated) but consistent, signaling a lyric register. However, perceptual signature is generic; Mara's way of noticing does not reflect character-specific bias. Sentences often open with "She" or "The" in template cadence: "She lifted the lens... She placed the lens... She recorded the event... She noticed..." Heavy filter-verb reliance ("felt a rare peace," "saw the faces") dulls immediacy at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature ("feeling the cold edges like a reminder," "whispered a promise to the vines") maintains a consistent lyric register. However, the narrative leans heavily on filter verbs ("he sensed," "he felt," "he knew") that dull immediacy, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the dual nature," "the paradox") mismatched to the tactile world. The garden's "mossy voice" and anthropomorphized dialogue flatten the naturalistic texture established earlier. No dialogue among human characters appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and perceptual signature ("mechanically warm hands," tactile focus on vibration and glow) is consistent. Voice modulates minimally under pressure since no crisis occurs. However, diction drifts into register mismatches: "obliging nature," "luminous mind," and "temporal drift" feel abstracted from a mechanic's lived idiom. The single line of dialogue ("Rest now, for we will wake the station's heart again at twilight…") reads as thematic narration rather than natural speech. Psychic distance remains fixed, offering little modulation to reflect urgency or relief.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with controlled focalization through Mara. Diction is lyrical and elevated throughout, creating a consistent atmospheric texture. However, register occasionally drifts into ornate phrasing ("lately inspired," "caress carve new symbols," "gratitude for the secret") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. Perceptual signature is dreamy but generic; no distinct idiom or rhythm that reflects Mara's particular mind. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression and pattern are present but borderline precious.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a consistent lyric register ("bruised gold," "auroral sorrow," "a feather caught in a gale"). Perceptual signature leans abstract-poetic; diction ("fault-tolerant oracle," "peripherally aware," "occupying margins") mixes tech/scientific register with metaphysical phrasing in a way that feels prompted rather than organically Mirela's. No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks a concrete, character-particular texture—descriptions could apply to any contemplative protagonist in an atmospheric setting. Under peak stress (discovering the barometer match), the prose remains uniformly figurative rather than compressing or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.1)
    Diction oscillates between elevated lyricism ("rusted artery," "frozen syllables") and concrete action without a stable perceptual signature anchored in Mara's mind. Filter verbs and abstract modifiers ("drowsy alertness," "invisible mass") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. POV distance is inconsistent: some lines inhabit close third, others drift into omniscient summary ("the tunnel seemed to breathe"). Gender pronouns shift (his/he) without clarity on Mara's identity, harming voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent perceptual signature: "grips reality loosely," "memory to slip like water." Diction is purposefully lyric and elevated, fitting the chronicle-keeper voice. However, multiple phrases ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace," "untold seasons") recur without functional variation, creating a template cadence. No dialogue present. The prose reads as authored rather than inhabited under pressure, with uniform syntactic rhythm across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction is purposefully lyric—"breath of the earth," "dreaming roots"—and the voice remains consistent across emotional beats. Perceptual signature is present (Liora notices music, breath, light), though filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") stack in high-density passages without purpose, slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice-distinction bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent—elevated, slightly archaic ("moth," "gilt thread," "bronze quiet")—and matches the post-apocalyptic scholar milieu. However, perceptual signature is generic: "feeling the weight of each stone," "breathing in the smell of soot" could apply to any sensitive observer. Psychic distance remains static across all beats; no modulation under stress. The prose leans on filter verbs ("he believes," "he reasons," "he feels") that dull immediacy, and repeated template stems ("He lifts," "He writes," "He records") flatten rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction and third-person limited focalization without head-hopping. However, register drifts into corporate/academic phrasing ("orchestrate a message," "transpose life into a new key," "encoded breaths," "quiet music of hidden truths") that exceeds the POV's plausible lexicon and flattens specificity. Perceptual signature is generic—lighthouse, sea, dawn, gull—without character-particular bias. The visitor's brief appearance lacks distinct voice or interior access. Purposeful compression is attempted (lyric recurrence, patterned imagery) but the pattern is not taught early or paid off causally, reading as ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance but adopts an elevated, abstract register ("resonant currents," "plumb the deepest layers of perception") that rarely grounds in the priest's particular perceptual signature. Diction is ornate and uniform across beats, with runs of abstract nouns and participial openers ("believing," "sensing," "lifting"). No dialogue appears. Rhetorical devices are claimed ("spoke in riddles and similes," "crafted through rhetorical devices") but not enacted on the page, creating a gap between assertion and execution. The voice reads generic-lyric rather than character-specific, and psychic distance does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lian, with a consistent perceptual signature filtered through her craft (fortune-cookie writer, conductor of unseen melodies). Diction is elevated and lyric, matching the atmospheric register, and sensory selection reflects her priorities (spiral chambers, phosphorescent memory, frozen glass). However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("intangible corridors of time," "unseen symphonies") without grounding in immediate action, and some filter constructions ("she felt," "she closed her eyes, letting") slightly dull immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice reads more atmospheric than character-particular under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.7)
    POV distance is stable and third-person-limited, but the perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific noticing or idiom. Diction drifts into elevated register ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") that clashes with immediate action. No dialogue present. Filter verbs and passive constructions dull immediacy in peak beats. The narrator remains a camera rather than a mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single close-third POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic ("yawned like a throat of stone," "ribbons," "marrow"), matching a lyric mode, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("the heart can still compose a symphony"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Marin notices vibrations and textures without character-specific idiom or bias. The voice modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and filter verbs are rare. Purposeful compression in the lyric frame is legible, though some phrases ("filament of hush") repeat without evolving meaning mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, but does not reflect a storm recorder's technical vocabulary or perceptual bias in a character-specific way. Recurring phrases ("layered tranquility," "quiet courtyard at dusk") create template cadence without voice modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present, so subtext and distinction bullets are inapplicable. The narration does not withhold facts Elara knows, and psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable and third-person limited, but the perceptual signature is generic: "faint pulse of the stones," "whispered of centuries" could apply to any wanderer-poet archetype. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("residual energy," "marrow of the universe") that lacks character specificity. No dialogue appears. The voice offers lyric atmosphere but no distinct idiom or filter that would mark this narrator's particular way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("chronic hush," "mendicant's bowl," "perpetual act of seeking") that remains consistent but edges into ornamental diction during peak beats without clear character filter. Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-particular; the violinist's interiority reads as thematic narration. Free indirect style blurs: "she felt that the act of unbinding silence with music was the truest tribute" reads as author thesis rather than character perception under pressure. No distinct rhythmic modulation with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara's professional detachment and sensory focus on fragrance and static—and diction remains elevated throughout ("counterfeit emotion dealer," "subsume the ambient sentiment"). However, voice lacks modulation under pressure; the same meditative register persists from opening to close without syntactic or rhythmic shift. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "watched") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the lyric mode. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—diction like "cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive," and "cycles of compassion" could attach to any character. Register drifts into elevated abstractions ("the flow of kindness across every harbor") that clash with a cargo broker's concrete world. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not applied. Psychic distance widens into summary mode for the ceremony and fishermen's arrival, flattening immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.9)
    Diction is elevated and uniform throughout, with no modulation under pressure. Phrases like "luminescent ache," "ribbons of violet," and "trembling stars" recur in parallel constructions, creating template cadence. The POV remains stable third-person limited on Arlen, but interiority is thin and declarative ("her motivation was simple yet profound"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the orchard "seemed to sigh" and the arbor "watched silently" without embodied filter.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (illustrator's eye: "sketches could coax the soul from a fossil," ink capturing fractured light) carries professional specificity. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register ("mythic source," "tangible slice of borrowed time," "chorus of whispers") that exceeds the narrator's established voice under pressure. Psychic distance contracts during the cavern descent but without embodied urgency. Purposeful compression and lyric cadence are taught early, but filter verbs ("she sensed," "she realized") dull immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance stays consistent. However, diction frequently inflates beyond plausible narrative register: "gently inventive," "delicate dance between curiosity and compassion," "ambiguous loss," "buried optimism blooming like a night flower," "coefficient of gentle invention" read as thematic annotation rather than the conjurer's lived perception. Sentence structures repeat a template cadence—"He placed… aligning… an ambiguous loss"; "He traced… noting how… inviting"; "He raised… feeling… and sensed"—that flattens rhythm across emotional beats. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic; the conjurer notices in complete, balanced clauses without urgency-driven compression or idiosyncratic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maren. Diction is elevated and poetic—"sapphire hush," "quiet arteries," "lingering shadows"—but consistent throughout, so register is voice-motivated rather than drift. Phrase recycling is notable: "sapphire hush" appears four times, "sense memory" five times, "kindly methodical" twice, "visible to those who need you" twice, creating template cadence that flattens rhythm. Perceptual signature is generic—Maren notices dust, rust, echoes—without character-specific bias. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent third-limited, tracking Marlowe's perceptions and thoughts. Perceptual signature leans scientific-lyric: "fine silver filament," "data point," "equation," "tiny rivers reshaping a landscape." The elevated register ("circuitously sincere," "apologetic unfurling of chlorophyll") reads more essayistic than character-particular under peak observation moments. Psychic distance stays controlled, but the voice does not degrade or shift texture under pressure—storm and leaf-turn receive the same meditative cadence as setup, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable; distance and focalization are consistent. Diction occasionally overreaches—"wryly earnest," "haggard awe," "thresh meaning from experience"—into elevated phrasing that feels imposed rather than voice-rooted. Perceptual signature is present in Mara's attention to "each flicker of candlelight as a clue," but under peak pressure (the convergence) the narration shifts to passive reception ("a voice, faint as the rain, offered an exchange") rather than active perception. No head-hopping; internal voice is coherent if not deeply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person POV remains stable, but distance is inconsistent—Lira's interiority is thin and filtered through stock phrasing ("feels the unseen forces settle"). Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("steadily unpredictable change," "constellation of notes") that does not feel character-bound. The pilgrim and child have no interior access, and their actions lack subtext. Perceptual signature is absent; the narration reads as generic omniscient rather than a distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, poetic texture with controlled diction ("ocean-spray archivist," "living tide of memory," "staggered intervals") that remains consistent across beats. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—the archivist's way of noticing reads as elevated narrator rather than an individual mind under pressure. Psychic distance is consistently distant, which suits the accumulative design but flattens interiority. Sentence rhythm is purposeful but occasionally mechanical (repeated "he" + verb stems in the first half). No dialogue present; filter verbs ("aware that," "knowing that") are frequent but voice-motivated for the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries consistent elevated diction ("analytically artistic blend," "trembling certainty"). However, register drifts into stock lyricism under pressure ("each footfall echoing against the vaulted ceiling," "promise to the unseen architects") that feels authored rather than focalized through the mapper's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static; the mapper's "tremor of certainty" and "awe" are named rather than shown through embodied perception or micro-gesture. The prose voice is uniform across calm and crisis beats, missing the compression or cadence shift expected when stakes tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("courageously kind," "a quiet alcove in the tower's echo where memories could settle like sediment"). Perceptual signature is ornate but consistent. However, the diction never modulates under pressure—crisis and calm read identically lush. Filter constructions ("She realized," "she felt") appear but are voice-consistent. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout with purposeful compression and rhythmic control. However, diction frequently drifts into stock poetic constructions ("lover's sigh," "silent witness") and template phrasing ("eyes heavy with," "hushed yet promising") that flatten the perceptual signature. The immortal's interior texture remains generic rather than character-particular. Dialogue (the soft voice and twin) is minimal and serves thematic articulation more than character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Mara's perceptual filter. Diction is elevated and consistent—"breach the veil of ordinary perception," "midnight river," "veins of gold"—creating a ritualistic voice that supports the funeral-home setting. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a living calculus of moral exchange," "twin vessels for change") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext cannot be judged. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose privileges lyric texture over Mara's immediate sensory and emotional reality under pressure, flattening her perceptual signature at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.3)
    The perceptual signature is highly stylized ("each leaf a careful inkstroke," "blue echo of yesterday, amber pulse of tomorrow") but consistent throughout, establishing a lyric register. However, the same elevated diction and parallel structures recur without modulation under pressure, creating a static tonal layer rather than voice that breathes with scene needs. Psychic distance remains stable third-person-limited with no head-hopping. The prose reads as authored voice rather than the stationer's embodied mind; filtration through character priorities is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (filtering metaphors, texture focus) but lacks character-specific bias—diction feels curated rather than voice-driven, with elevated phrasing ("absurdly pristine," "palimpsest of voices") that sits at the edge of the narrator's plausible lexicon. Under peak pressure (murals appearing, realization unfolding) the prose maintains uniform rhythm and register without compression or modulation, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV narration is stable, and diction occasionally reflects Selene's profession ("epistemic compass," "myth-busting quests"). However, perceptual signature is weak—her noticing is generic rather than biased by her investigative background. The phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" and multiple abstract flourishes ("ephemeral compass," "universal riddle") blur into elevated diction that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a lyric, manifesto-tinged voice ("perpetual carnival," "anarchic joy," "hopeful desperation") that distinguishes the narrator's stance. However, psychic distance drifts: Mira's perceptual signature is generic ("she realized," "she discovered") rather than idiosyncratic, and elevated diction ("reclaimed streets," "clandestine network") clashes with the immediate sensory texture of carnival life. No dialogue appears, so character distinction through speech is not tested. Filter verbs ("seeing," "knowing") appear frequently but do not obscure immediacy enough to trigger heavy penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains elevated register ("aching line," "elegy," "threaded through the melancholy") consistently, but diction occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("dawning hush of the universe," "heartbeat of the universe itself") that blurs the inspector's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. The camera click "echoed the heartbeat of the universe" reads as authorial assertion rather than POV-filtered perception. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (sound, vibration, imagined geometry) is consistent and purposeful. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("magnetic calm," "luminous futures") that feels imposed rather than rooted in her artisan idiom. The single line of direct address ("Feel the lift") carries subtext but stands alone. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable single-third, and diction carries a purposeful lyric register ("rusted compass," "ice sang"). However, the narrative voice tilts toward elevated poetic phrasing that occasionally clashes with Mara's pragmatic editorial role ("worrying tranquility," "ode to singular convergence"). Mara's perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—sensory details (iron taste, ice crunch) could belong to any attentive observer. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure, but the voice reads more authorial than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person POV distance is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction oscillates between archaic register ("wild hush," "cryptic bell tuner") and generic descriptors without anchoring in the tuner's lived experience. Filter verbs ("felt the balance," "seemed to carry") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy. No on-page dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose reads more like external reportage than a mind under pressure, and the recurring phrase "wild hush" is asserted rather than rendered through sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and consistent ("violet gloom," "moonlit glass"), though register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("unsnarl thought itself, by overriding instinct"). Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices in a way any diver might. The phrase "distress signal sender" is used three times, twice as a label for Mara herself, creating odd distancing. No dialogue to assess. Textural specificity is present but not character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.1)
    Register oscillates between lyric elevation ("copperlight repose settled on the damp floor, painting every cracked tile") and narrative summary without a stable focalizer. POV certainty exceeds what the boy can know ("bodies rose in grateful silence," "future callers"). Diction like "sustaining impossibilities" and "thread a labyrinth with your own story" feels externally imposed rather than voice-specific. The boy's perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person distant narration maintains a consistent elevated register but lacks perceptual signature—every sentence could belong to any lyric-fantasy narrator. Diction is ornate and uniform, with no modulation under pressure because no pressure exists. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt," "remembered") stack without voice motivation. POV remains stable but generic, offering no character-particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited to the weaver, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Diction leans heavily on elevated, abstracted phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace," "reverence") that reads as authorial overlay rather than the weaver's perceptual signature. Sentence structures fall into parallel patterns: "She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]… Each [noun] [verb]…" creating a lulling, incantatory rhythm that flattens rather than modulates with pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She saw," "She understood," "She felt") proliferate without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; Mara's perceptual filter is consistent (reverent, curious, steadied). Diction leans elevated and atmospheric throughout—"marrow of the dead whisper faint hymns," "cautious enchantment," "shared sunrise"—which reads purposeful but occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("bone-laced corridors," "glowing tapestry"). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, the prose sometimes prioritizes texture over interior specificity, and the voice does not modulate sharply under pressure; the cadence remains hushed and ceremonial even at the climactic placement.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person POV is stable, but the narrative voice is abstract and distanced—Mara's perceptual signature (what she notices and how) never emerges. Diction slips into elevated register ("ceremonial conduit," "lattice of light," "invisible spaces between intention and execution") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains uniform across all beats, offering no modulation under the ritual's supposed pressure. No dialogue appears; interior access is sparse and generic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("bruised with dying stars," "echoed silence," "promise of change") that reads generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed," "she knew") stack without voice-driven purpose, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is minimal; the narrator's way of noticing does not reveal selective bias or character-particular priorities. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single third-person POV maintains stable distance and registers a perceptual signature through metaphors (roots as verses, water as liquid glass). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("fierce tenderness," "eternal grace") that clash with embodied moments. No dialogue present. The narrator's certainty about the medium's internal states ("she realized," "she understood") reads assured but abstracts emotional progression rather than tracking sensory degradation or ambivalence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but elevated throughout ("pacific conflict-zone translator," "lotus-hearted ache"), bordering on ornamental lyricism that never modulates with pressure. The child does not speak; no dialogue to test naturalism or subtext. Perceptual signature is generic poetic filter rather than character-particular. Free-indirect style is clean but unvaried.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct texture in diction ("photon-kissed pigment," "soft gratitude shared across distant scholars"). POV distance is stable, and the perceptual filter remains character-specific. However, elevated register drifts into abstraction ("pensive mirth," "unspooling daydream," "eternity") in peak beats, and the prose occasionally explains what has been shown ("the true power of her craft was not merely to illuminate walls, but to illuminate hearts"). No dialogue is present; the piece is evaluated for narrative voice alone, which maintains coherence but lacks the compression and rhythm control required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is ornate and consistent, with a lyric texture ("methodically playful," "breathless instant") that suits the fantastical setting. However, POV modesty slips: Lena perceives "a rhythm she had never heard before" (her own heartbeat), which strains credulity, and the narration asserts her understanding ("the hobo nickel was not merely a coin but a conduit") without showing the inference process. The prose often tells emotional states ("She felt the garden's pulse," "she understood") rather than embodying them through perception and choice. Distance remains stable, but the voice converges on declarative epiphany at key beats, flattening the character's particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narration maintains an elevated, metaphor-dense register throughout. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—Lysander's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific, and diction ("candidly cryptic," "converging chaos," "luminous thread") reads as prompt-derived rather than idiomatic. Dr. Mirabel's interior is withheld, yet her decision pivot is asserted without the micro-thought that would earn the shift. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are not applied.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lush, with purposeful compression ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") that teaches a lyric pattern. However, perceptual signature is generic—any poet might notice "silver veins" and "iridescent hope"—and the diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous language," "redemption") that sits outside a lived interior. Single-POV control is clean, but the voice lacks the idiosyncratic bias required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice is lush and consistent, but POV distance drifts into omniscient assertion ("the museum itself seemed to sigh," "deserted marvels no longer felt abandoned") without anchoring perception in the caretaker's embodied experience. The traveler's interiority appears suddenly ("felt the weight of each name settle like dew upon his tongue") despite no focalization cue. Diction is elevated and uniform—"gently systematic," "foxglove regret," "opal panes"—creating a homogenous register that flattens urgency under pressure and obscures individual perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the prose maintains a lyric register throughout. Diction leans elevated ("arcane linguist," "vaulted extinct language archive") but stays consistent; no head-hopping occurs. However, psychic distance never modulates with pressure, and the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Elara notices in the same poetic cadence whether tracing glyphs or watching scholars emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice leans heavily on elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt," "sapphire thread") that often feels imposed rather than character-filtered; Mira's perceptual signature is generic rather than mechanist-specific. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she imagined," "she knew") stack in key beats, dulling immediacy. The single line of dialogue ("When stone weeps, rivers speak") is functional but not tested for subtext or voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction fluctuates between concrete observation ("thin column of light") and elevated abstraction ("a withering grace," "histories both personal and planetary"). Lila's perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific; no vocabulary, syntax, or rhythm marks her as a courier pigeon trainer. Register drift into literary generality ("luminous whirl," "labyrinthine network") dilutes voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but the narrative voice drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("necessary distances between breath and echo," "a prayer to the unseen architects of wind") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a child's perception. Perceptual signature is generic; the child notices in poetic but undifferentiated ways. No dialogue. Register mismatch is mild but persistent; the lexicon ("lineage," "talismans," "essential geometry") exceeds plausible child vocabulary without ironic distance or clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose establishes a consistent lyric register with purpose-driven diction ("breath held in amber," "steps softly ingenious") and no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: Aria notices beauty and patterns but her way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or priority beyond the broadly poetic. Filter verbs ("She felt the pull," "She understood") stack without voice-motivated justification. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and held, lifting the score above mid-range despite the abstract interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable in close third-person with Maren as focalizer; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is limited: diction cycles through a narrow palette of synesthetic abstraction ("iridescent," "translucent," "kaleidoscopic") without character-specific bias. Sentence stems repeat mechanically across emotional beats: "The [X] pulsed," "She felt," "The [Y] whispered." Free indirect style is clean when used, but interiority defaults to telling ("her heart lightened," "she realized") rather than filtering perception through a distinct mind. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; intensity is asserted via adjectives rather than syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and immersive, filtering setting through the performer's aesthetic priorities. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("calculated wilderness," "orchestrated serendipity"). However, elevated register ("conduit for orchestrated serendipity," "marble pattern into shards that resembled tiny constellations") persists through peak beats without rhythm variation, creating a static lyric gloss. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains fixed; under pressure (audience reaction, final act) the prose does not modulate, maintaining the same contemplative remove throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric distance and distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight fell like spilled ink," "obsidian grace"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("universal speech," "cosmic stanza") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs are minimal, and POV remains stable in third-limited. The voice is legible and coherent, though it does not modulate under pressure—Lira's register at the climax matches her opening calm, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose adopts a single elevated, poetic register throughout ("noctilucent reckonings," "silent dialogue," "read between lines of wind and water") that does not modulate with pressure or reflect Mira's occupation as a glazier in diction or perception. No distinct perceptual signature; the voice reads as generic lyric narrator. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains static; no compression or intensification under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice oscillates between lyric register ("stars twirling in patient arcs") and therapy-speak abstraction ("gently skilled at stitching wounds with silence," "hard softness"). No dialogue appears; all meaning is asserted through narration. The prose favors elevated, poetic diction throughout, which reads consistent but flattens under pressure—high-stakes moments (setting the box, opening it) receive the same ornate treatment as transit, reducing propulsion. Perceptual signature is generic; Maren's way of noticing (moonlight, ash, faces in glass) could belong to any reflective protagonist, lacking character-specific bias or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance floats into summarizing overview ("he proposed a festival…," "the community's spirit…began to revitalize"). Diction is lyric-elevated throughout, with phrases like "serene upheaval" and "luminous sphere woven from pearl-white kelp" dominating even practical beats, creating register monotony rather than modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Arin's mathematician lens never filters perception distinctively. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (sound-as-vision, echo-as-syllable) remains consistent and voice-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("year-after-year," "living tapestry," "symphony of stone") that reads more narrator than character, especially under peak moments. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she sensed," "she understood") cluster but remain voice-motivated. Purposeful compression in the opening and closing sustains lyric coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.7)
    Voice demonstrates lyric ambition with patterned diction ("dusky harmony," "prism parapet after rain"), but perceptual signature is generic and interchangeable. Psychic distance remains far throughout with no modulation under pressure. Recycled stems ("each," "the," "his") and stock metaphors ("borrowed heartbeat," "cascade of light") flatten texture. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited focalization through Lira is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she notices the clipboard's grain, the scent of jasmine) and diction is controlled, if occasionally elevated ("operatively gentle" recurs as a constructed phrase). The prose modulates with ritual solemnity, appropriate to tone, but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture under pressure. Dialogue is minimal (the hymn is described, not rendered); the piece relies on narration that occasionally slips into abstract register ("fragile magnificence of humanity's attempt") at the closure beat, weakening voice-driven immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person narration remains stable, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—elevated diction ("lattice of white fissures," "fractured grace") pervades without modulation under pressure. Phrases like "amoral philanthropist" and "fractured grace" repeat as external labels rather than emerging through the character's particular way of noticing. The prose reads as elevated literary omniscience throughout, with no shift in psychic distance or rhythm to reflect the protagonist's state at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable (close third on the courtesan) with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated, lyric register ("between sigh and smile," "bodily poetic cadence") that suits the accumulative mode. However, diction often drifts into stock poeticism ("quiet hymn," "tapestry," "alchemy of sound") without character-particular perception. Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("she realized," "she felt") accumulate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure, and the narrator's perceptual signature is not selective or biased in a character-specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV third limited is stable, and diction attempts an elevated register ("urbane," "uncommonly serene," "conscience unspooling"). However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature: Selene's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific, and interiority is told in abstract phrasing ("half-lit revelation," "quiet promise") rather than filtered through her calligrapher's craft or idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Distance is consistent but the voice reads like committee consensus—lyrical but not anchored to this character's particular mind under pressure. Purposeful elision is minimal; the reflection mode is transparent but uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted," "blushing stillness") that clashes with concrete action; the voice feels ornamental rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—Lira notices beauty but her way of noticing lacks bias or selectivity. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose reads as committee voice rather than singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV distance is stable, and diction ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") attempts a distinct texture. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("resonated through the ice walls," "living conduit") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. The phrases "technically gentle" and "snowmelt ardor" recur as labels without dramatization. No dialogue on the page; the lone traveler remains voiceless, flattening potential for perceptual contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Foresight Hindsight Only; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ethereal grit," "sentient filament," "nexus"), creating a distinct atmospheric texture. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract metaphysical constructions ("transcend the limits of linear time," "radiated outward like ripples") that drift toward essay voice rather than embodied perception. Perceptual signature is thin—her unique way of seeing foresight/hindsight is told, not shown through selective, contradictory noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited distance is stable, and diction ("waning amber," "uncloak," "dusky harmony") establishes a consistent lyric-elevated register. However, vocabulary often drifts into abstract elevation ("encrypted devotion," "celestial signature," "perpetual note of dusky harmony") that exceeds immediate perception. Perceptual signature is generic—descriptors like "ancient dust" and "violet glow" could apply to any mystical scene. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains steady but does not modulate with pressure; the narrator's register at discovery, ritual work, and closure is uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable and third-person limited to Mara, with brief windows into Kovan and the wanderer that do not constitute head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing reads like neutral camera rather than character-specific bias. Dialogue ("Feel the rhythm of your own cells") is stiff, expository, and tonally flat. Register drifts into pseudoscientific abstraction ("cellular memory," "nervous pathways") without grounding in Mara's lived idiom. The prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure; the wanderer's climax uses the same template cadence as the monks'.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the diction ("coaxing silvered glass," "glass-mountain tone of silence") carries a consistent lyric register. However, perceptual signature is thin—Arlen's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific priorities or biases. Under pressure, the narrator does not compress or shift rhythm; each beat maintains the same ornate cadence regardless of stakes. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "believed") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as a single textured voice rather than a mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent past tense. Perceptual signature is present (guild teachings, orchard pulse, quartz light) but not character-particular; diction reads generic-literary rather than guild-mender specific. Mira's single line of dialogue is functional but does not carry subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") and passive constructions ("was summoned," "had been") dull immediacy in several beats without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("nonlinear inheritance," "philosophical breakthroughs," "brightened disquiet") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak; the curator notices in generalities (luminous, translucent, soft) without idiosyncratic bias. Psychic distance fluctuates without purpose—sometimes close ("His mind… struggled"), sometimes remote ("He realized"). No dialogue appears. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric distance and elevated diction throughout, with no head-hopping or tense breaks. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—Selene's noticing is generic, not character-specific. Under peak moments (unlocking the door, viewing the scrolls), diction remains uniformly formal without modulation or compression. The time traveler and Selene sound identical in narration, and no dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose sustains elevated diction ("chimera twin discoverer," "unkindled solace humming beneath the rust") across all beats, flattening distance and creating register drift—no modulation under pressure. POV control is stable (third limited) but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic: she "felt," "believed," "realized" without idiosyncratic filter. Internal voice lacks specificity; lines like "freedom can be both cage and wind" read as aphorism rather than character-particular thought. No dialogue to test for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds consistently; no head-hopping. Diction toggles between grounded action ("descended the spiral stair, each step echoing") and elevated register ("the fables of absence were not voids but bridges") that strains Mara's archivist lexicon under peak pressure. Perceptual signature—cataloguing each cog "as if it were a story"—establishes character filter, but voice at the climax ("the clarity she sought settled like dust on ancient ledgers") reads ornamental rather than urgent. Free indirect style remains clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. The mapkeeper's perceptual signature—noticing vibrations, reading fissures as notes—is character-specific and maintained under pressure. Diction is controlled: "ripple-mark skin," "hammered repose," and "sapphire light" feel purposeful. However, no dialogue appears (acceptable per policy), and some phrases ("feeling the vibrations settle into a rhythm") lean toward abstraction. Register remains steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is consistent and the diction ("tarnished lantern," "thistle-blown hope") carries a distinct lyric texture. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("retrocognitively blessed," "fate is a thread they can follow") that exceeds the custodian's plausible on-page idiom during high-pressure beats. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks the perceptual signature of a lived-in mind under stress—no micro-choices in noticing or elision that reveal character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and poetic diction throughout, creating a coherent atmospheric texture. However, the prose frequently drifts into abstract proclamation ("preemptively nostalgic," "sculpt identity from experience") that reads as authorial thesis rather than character-specific perception. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("seemed to materialize," "would continue to guide") dull immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. The focalization is stable but lacks a perceptual signature—sensory selection does not reveal character-specific bias or professional priority.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice exhibits purposeful compression and pattern-taught lyricism ("through ambient awareness," "filter through the memory of a note in mosaic"), which the rubric allows when legible and paid off at closure. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("serious playfulness," "gravity of hopelessness") that clashes with concrete action, especially in peak beats where embodied perception would sharpen pressure. Single-POV focalization remains stable, but perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful cadence ("her script curling like the tide's own handwriting"). However, perceptual signature is thin—the chronicler's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. The two clan leaders speak in a single sentence with no distinct idiom. Psychic distance remains stable, but the elevated diction ("tangential approach," "embodied") occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (poetic, sensory, introspective) and diction stays within a lyric register. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "watched") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent. The prose modulates rhythmically with pressure—short beats during the climb, longer during the sprouting—though some lines ("intangibly tangible, a paradox that allowed feelings to be stored in clay") approach exposition mid-scene. No dialogue present; interior voice is distinct if occasionally self-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—calm, observant, attuned to sound and light—but lacks idiosyncratic texture or pressure modulation. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("felt," "watched") dilute immediacy without voice motivation. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is present but does not impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register with phrases like "sallyed," "fermented jasmine and silicon," "blooming data trees." However, diction occasionally drifts into generic fantasy-tech ("polished alloy," "pixelated rain") without POV-specific texture. No dialogue appears. Distance is stable, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Mina notices everything equally. The voice supports atmosphere but doesn't modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—lyric, elevated diction—but lacks modulation under pressure; the same register ("tender shadow keeper," "suffocating air now a gentle wind") persists at every beat regardless of stakes. Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("to teach the suffocating darkness to breathe," "linking through scars") are taught early and held through closure, which qualifies under experimental tolerance. However, the narrator's way of noticing is generalized rather than character-specific; no concrete interior texture anchors the abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent elevated register and the perceptual filter (noticing phosphorescent spores, quantum hum in reality) reads as character-specific. However, diction drifts into prompt-label territory ("virtuously mischievous," "shadowseam wonder," "righteous mischief") that feels imposed rather than idiomatic. The manager's brief dialogue is indistinct from narration, and Lira's single line lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Internal thought formatting is stable, but the prose does not compress or modulate rhythm under peak pressure—sentence length and syntax remain uniform throughout. No head-hopping, but the perceptual signature does not degrade or sharpen as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds without head-hopping. The diction remains elevated throughout ("eloquently silent," "first yawn of evening," "bridge of intuition") in a register that reads as ornamental rather than voice-motivated by a scholar's mindset. Perceptual signature is weak; Lian's noticing is generic and does not reflect a historian's or scholar's trained attention. No dialogue appears. The narration uses filter verbs ("he realized," "he felt") at peak beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited voice maintains consistent psychic distance and supplies a distinct perceptual signature—"factually mystical glow," "as reality shifts around the green glass"—that reads purposeful and pattern-taught. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss," "symphony of midnight alchemy") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted, especially under what should be peak pressure. No dialogue appears; interior access remains stable. Patterned repetition of "murmured allegiance" and "as reality shifts" creates a rhythmic coherence that supports the Accumulative lens, preventing a steeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual filtering is present ("faint pulse of empathy," "soft glow"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("choreography," "Acts of Compassion" as a filing label, "beacon for the unknown") that exceeds the archivist's established voice. Sentence stems recur ("She traced," "She placed," "She reached," "She felt") creating template cadence across emotional beats. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices poetic environmental details ("silver veil," "glittering waves") without character-specific bias or blind spots. Diction remains elevated and uniform throughout, lacking modulation under pressure; the transmitter scene should compress syntax and narrow sensory range, but the prose sustains the same lyrical register. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") appear but are not excessive. The final paragraph's "they learned to read the night" shifts briefly to collective narration without clear focalization, creating minor distance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric register ("each breath a filament of color stretched taut over the silence"), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vested hush," "negative space") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. POV distance is stable third-limited. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present but generic—many lyric narrators notice dewdrops and mist in similar ways. The piece sustains its register under pressure but does not modulate rhythm or syntax in response to escalation, reading as uniform lyricism throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("ashen skyborne arbor," "mossy delight") carries a consistent elevated register. However, the narrative distance flattens under pressure—there is no modulation or tightening as stakes (should) rise. The prose leans toward ornamental lyricism ("hush where past meets prophecy," "soft prod of destiny") that decorates rather than embodies Lira's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Perceptual bias is minimal; the narrator notices forest details uniformly rather than through Lira's particular priorities or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice remains consistent in third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a lyric-philosophical register that suits the material. Perceptual signature is present (moss light, ozone smell, drip-drip rhythm) and character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("paradox itself were a compass," "when coincidence becomes pattern") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon during action beats. No head-hopping or tense breaks. The prose has intentional rhythmic patterning but some phrases echo prompt language too closely, reducing voice particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent (metallic scent, amber light, precise temperature) but lacks distinct idiosyncrasy—diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("factually mystical," "invisible mass") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled, and free indirect style is clean. The protagonist's way of noticing (professional, measured) is signaled but not deeply individuated; under peak stress, the voice maintains its formal cadence without compression or rhythmic modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Mara's way of noticing feels generic ("pale gold of dawn," "translucent sighs"). Diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous ache," "symphony of light") that clashes with scene urgency. Filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("She understood," "She recalled"), dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present; voice lacks distinct rhythm or character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira, but the diction oscillates between lyric abstraction ("lattice of bruised memories," "ultraviolet penance") and plain narration without a consistent perceptual signature. Register drifts into elevated, abstract phrasing ("mathematics of mercy," "geometry of compassion") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. The prose at peak beats (the equation whisper, the strap removal) remains in the same abstracted register, missing the opportunity for compression or rhythmic shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice maintains an elevated, incantatory register throughout ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition settle like stars") that reads consistent but lacks modulation under pressure. Diction remains uniform—"between‑worlds translator," "eternal instant," "timeless instant"—with no perceptual signature tied to the narrator's supposed profession or history. The prose texture is recognizable but does not degrade or sharpen in response to tension. Filter verbs ("I realize," "I remember") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric, with character-specific perception (e.g., "horologist's mainspring barrel" signals expertise). However, the prose leans on stock phrases ("skillfully observant," "strange lightness," "quiet purpose") and elevated register that flattens urgency in peak beats. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices everything relevant without bias or blind spots, reducing voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds without leakage, and the lexicon is consistent—elevated, abstract, lyric. However, perceptual signature is generic: Mara notices in stock terms ("traced," "believed," "realized," "watched") without idiosyncratic bias. Diction drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("rustling awakenings," "negotiable," "compress eternity") that reads like theme labels rather than character thought. Filter verbs stack ("She realized," "She decided," "She traced," "She lifted") across peak beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction tilts purple ("gilded relic," "luminous veil," "burnished sorrow") and uniform throughout, flattening urgency under pressure. Lira's perceptual signature is generic elevated register without character-specific bias. The verse she recites is paraphrased rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance does not modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a fairy-tale register ("legend whispered," "tinkersong wonder"), but lacks perceptual signature—Alder's way of noticing is generic rather than repairman-specific. Diction is elevated throughout without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears. Distance remains stable, and POV is clean, but the prose does not reflect Alder's interior state or professional lens; vocabulary and rhythm feel externally imposed rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature—mineral musk, "rain‑kissed stone," "the sigh of ancient tectonic plates"—is consistent and lyric. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("yawed open," "hinges of reality," "quiet surrender") that reads more authorial than character-particular. Psychic distance remains static; Mara's interior never tightens or degrades under pressure. The prose carries a committee voice—sensible omniscience—rather than a singular, stress-responsive texture. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira, but perceptual signature is generic lyric rather than sculptor-specific. Diction elevates uniformly ("storm-tossed archway," "turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances") regardless of pressure, creating register drift from a working artist's likely lexicon. Psychic distance stays constant; no modulation under stress. Filter verbs ("She feels," "She realizes") anchor reflection but do not sharpen immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter shows Mara's attention to light, color, and memory. However, diction drifts into elevated, non-idiomatic register ("umbral tenderness," "the dawning hush of the season settle around her like a soft veil") that sits uneasily with a "vivid mural artist" who splashes city walls; the lexicon reads more like literary tourism than character-specific thought. Filter verbs ("felt the stone floor vibrate," "felt tears trace paths") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose does not reflect a distinct mind under pressure—it narrates around Mara rather than through her idiosyncratic noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but elevated and homogeneous throughout, with no modulation under pressure ("her heart burned with a searing reverie, a relentless heat that turned memory into flame"). Psychic distance remains distant-omniscient; we are told Mara's feelings but rarely shown her perception filtering the world in a character-particular way. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not testable. Register occasionally drifts into pseudo-poetic abstraction ("temporal snare," "spectrum that Mara could translate") that feels more thematic than rooted in Mara's interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is uniform elevated-register throughout, with no modulation under pressure: "bruised sky," "amber of a promise never fulfilled," "constellations," "fragile glass of remembered desire." Diction remains abstract and decorative even at putative climax. The alchemist's perceptual signature is generic poetic observer—no character-specific bias in what he notices or how he processes. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is stable but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Harel, but the prose drifts into elevated, ornamental register ("velvet disquiet," "tapestry of sorrow and hope") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is vague: the scribe notices in generalized poetic terms rather than through a specific, biased lens. Diction remains uniform across calm and peak beats, lacking modulation under pressure. The narrative voice is controlled but reads as committee lyricism rather than a singular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice is stable third-limited with purposeful lyricism and elevated diction ("furiously tranquil," "texture of borrowed time"). However, register drifts into generic fantasy idiom ("icebound cathedral," "pale spiral of light") that could describe any mystical scene. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose often tells Mira's inner state rather than embodying it through perception or gesture. The grandmother's phrase feels inserted for thematic weight rather than voice-motivated memory.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person with stable distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent—"credibly curious," "windblown sanctuary," "thin, humming veil"—and vocabulary fits an educated, contemplative focalizer. Perceptual signature is technical (sensor data, humidity thresholds) and lyric (storm's "heartbeats," wind's "lullaby"). Some lines drift toward ornamental lyricism ("descended the staircase that spiraled like a vortex") without tonal fracture. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose establishes a ceremonial, elevated register ("cradle of flourishing stillness," "drink from the well of universal silence") that remains consistent throughout. However, the diction often drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("primal elegance," "fertile ground where vulnerability could sprout") and the janitor's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—no professional tic, idiosyncratic noticing, or lexicon tied to custodial or astronomical work. Psychic distance is uniform mid-range with no modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("mute eloquence," "tangled covenant," "kaleidoscope of colors") that fits the tone but becomes rhythmically repetitive. Sentence stems recur ("He would gaze," "He understood," "He remained") and the syntactic pattern flattens under its own weight. The voice is singular and stable, but POV distance is oddly detached—events unfold as tableau rather than lived perception. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent throughout. Diction trends toward elevated metaphor ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "unborn seconds," "era-shifting chronicle") that sometimes clashes with concrete action but remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Mara's way of noticing does not shift under pressure. The final paragraphs maintain the established register without modulation, missing an opportunity for rhythmic charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but the voice is generic elevated-poetic rather than character-particular: "warmly attentive spirit," "quiet reverence," "the universe held its breath." Diction remains uniformly lyrical without modulation under pressure; every sentence carries the same reverent register. Repeated syntactic stems flatten rhythm: "He knelt... He decided... He placed... He lifted... He tended." Filter constructions ("feeling each pulse," "feeling its warm pulse") dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is absent—the poet notices in writerly metaphors, not through a distinct lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, distance is consistent, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture (e.g., "bruised amber," "gently systematic," "copper veins pulsing"). Perceptual signature is present: Mara notices growth cycles, bark textures, resonance frequencies. However, filter verbs ("noted," "recorded," "aware") stack in expository passages, and diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("testament to interspecies dialogue"). No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Arin throughout. Diction is elevated and lyric ("melodic echo of far‑off chemistry," "bronze quiet fire") but consistent within the narrative stance. However, the prose frequently drifts into abstract register ("the chemistry of homecoming," "elemental bonds") that exceeds Arin's immediate sensory experience. Perceptual signature is generic: Arin notices what the plot requires rather than filtering details through a character-specific bias. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The scholars are described collectively without interior access or voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is distinct and elevated, with purposeful compression ("bruised violet," "bleached bones beneath the silvery surf") and consistent register. POV distance remains stable third-limited; the coachman's perceptual signature filters detail through his mission (bird calls as liturgy, seed pods as scrolls). Diction occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("submerged concord," "narrow vastness") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, but the texture is controlled and legible. No dialogue is present; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Rook throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("nose retained an intuitively descriptive keenness for the past"), but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a canine focalizer ("mythic device," "palpable closeness," "tapestry stitched from whispered myths"). Free indirect style is attempted but undercut by phrases that read as narrator commentary rather than Rook's interior lexicon. Rhythmic control is present in longer sentences, yet repeated template stems ("his [noun]," "the [noun]") flatten momentum in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    Voice is uniform elevated lyric ("blessed pariah," "river of light," "pliable canvas") without modulation under pressure or perceptual signature tied to character state. Diction remains abstract and metaphoric throughout; no concrete idiom or bias filters observation. Single-POV with no dialogue; internal stance is declarative rather than contradictory. Psychic distance is stable but flat, and the prose reads as a thematic essay rather than embodied perception. No POV leakage, but no distinct perceptual filter either.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice is ornate and consistent ("sacredly playful," "luminous moment," "glittering monolith") but leans toward purple prose and generic fantasy register. Sentence stems recur ("He had spent," "He whispered," "He returned"), and the narrator's perceptual signature is decorative rather than character-particular—Lysander notices celestial beauty and cosmic connection in clichéd terms. Psychic distance drifts between close interior ("his heart beating in rhythm") and distant summary ("the townsfolk greeted him with wary admiration") without clear modulation. No dialogue appears. The elevated diction ("chivalrous," "luminous," "sacredly playful") reads as imposed rather than voice-motivated, and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("a sacredly playful echo of courage") breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence"—that reads as consistent voice rather than ornament. Mira's perceptual signature (seeing history in missing pawns, spelling words in dust) is selective and character-specific. However, elevated diction ("interregnum," "vaulted whispering gallery," "tentative interregnum") occasionally drifts above the urgency of the moment, and no dialogue appears to test voice against another character.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with consistent elevated diction ("mercury-glass seer," "pools of liquid metal," "night flowers"). However, psychic distance is unstable: the opening reads distant third, but later beats slide into free indirect ("She realized that the stone did not merely substitute reality nightly") without clear cue. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is maintained through metaphor-heavy filtering, though it flattens under pressure rather than sharpening. Single-POV baseline is met; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (chess metaphors, fidgeting, tactical framing) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fierce repose," "woven hush") that feels imposed rather than the tutor's natural idiom under stress. Psychic distance holds steady; no dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Compression at peak beats (altar, release) maintains rhythm without obscuring focus.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filter is consistent (Mara's artist lens). Diction carries some specificity ("wounded beast," "forged hush"), but elevated register ("Let this echo carry us beyond the mist") drifts from the innocent-mischievous trait and reads as authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line to Lio); when present, it advances plot but lacks subtext or character distinction. Psychic distance stays mid-range without purposeful modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the alchemist's perceptual signature (tracing pockmarks, feeling the workshop's pulse merge with the sea's bite) is consistent. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("skeletal ship," "dire enchantment," "luminous intention") that remains voice-motivated and legible. However, under peak pressure—the moment she aligns the charm and speaks the tale—syntax does not compress or modulate; the rhythm stays decorative rather than tightening with urgency. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; free indirect thought is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    First-person POV remains stable with a consistent lyric register ("colors that seemed to linger longer than the tides themselves"). Perceptual signature is art-oriented (seascapes, brushstrokes, pigment). However, elevated diction ("intimate aloofness settle over my shoulders," "mouth of a coastal cave network") crowds nearly every sentence, flattening the rhythm and creating a uniform ornamental texture that does not modulate under pressure. No dialogue appears; psychic distance stays constant.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Mara's lens. Diction rises into elevated register ("luminous thread," "screaming tenderness," "fierce love that shouted silently") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular, creating mild register drift under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices in lyric cadence without idiosyncratic bias. Psychic distance stays consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The fisherman's interiority ("felt an unexpected tug," "his gratitude a soft murmur") briefly claims access outside Mara's knowledge but reads as modest inference rather than full breach.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on the navigator. Perceptual signature is present—the censer foot "echoing the navigator's own restless rhythm," the sea "stole their names"—but diction occasionally slips into elevated abstractions ("geography of loss," "raw solace") that feel imposed rather than arising from the character's idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, but the lack of embodied micro-observation under pressure (we never see her hands tremble, her breath catch, her eyes narrow) flattens the texture. The phrase "raw solace" recurs as a label rather than an enacted state.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable first-person with a consistent perceptual signature—"methodical calm that felt almost like prayer," "the orchard's breath"—and diction fits Mara's reflective stance. However, register drifts into elevated abstractions under pressure ("fractured grace," "covenant of empathy") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue with smugglers is functional but carries minimal subtext or goal-driven indirection. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (bruised lavender, opal surface, brittle petals) is consistent and poetic. Psychic distance is controlled. However, diction converges around "softly persistent" (three uses), "borrowed memory" (four uses), and elevated phrases ("hollowed sigh," "invisible ink") that read as thematic assertion rather than Marlowe's interior idiom. No dialogue on the page. Voice is distinct but leans lyric-decorative rather than inhabiting the keeper's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV third limited with stable past tense and controlled distance. The prose carries a consistent lyrical register ("scent of old parchment lingered like a memory of distant seas"), though under peak pressure at the threshold the texture remains elevated rather than tightening to urgency. Perceptual signature is generic; Elian notices in the same cadence whether cataloging maps or facing the doorway. No dialogue appears. Elision of the decision mechanism—how he "set his resolve like a compass needle"—is metaphoric without concrete anchor, and the final paragraphs summarize post-adventure cataloging rather than dramatizing the moment of return.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but narrative distance fluctuates without purpose—"disenchanted queen" and "lacy menace of the night" read as external editorial tags rather than the queen's perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("bleeding starlight across her mind," "cobalt grotto above clouds") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Follow"), carrying no subtext. The retinue remains voiceless ciphers. Perceptual signature is generic; the queen notices in catalog fashion (iron, rain, fireflies) without bias or selective attention shaped by her stated goal.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable (third-person limited on the alchemist) with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: the alchemist "glanced," "explained," "watched," "smiled" without character-specific noticing bias. Diction elevates at peak beats ("density of presence," "directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic") in ways that feel prompt-imported rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears to test subtext or character distinction. Filter verbs ("felt a surge," "felt certain") dominate emotional beats without embodied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single first-person POV is stable, and the lyric register is consistent and often striking ("letters rearrange themselves as if jealous of past selves"). Diction leans elevated and sometimes abstract ("lucid dream chronicler," "feral nostalgia"), which fits the reflective voice but risks distancing the reader from embodied urgency. No head-hopping or filter abuse. Some syntactic variety, though template stems recur ("I watch," "I feel," "I glance"). The voice is distinctive but lacks modulation under pressure—register holds steady across reflection and dream without a clear shift.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with Lena as focalizer; no head-hopping occurs. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric texture ("occluded views," "cryptic tableau," "cartographer mapping emotional terrain") that risks register drift into elevated diction not entirely rooted in an aromatherapist's lived lexicon. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("She believed," "She imagined," "She realized") appear frequently and dull immediacy. The piece teaches a pattern of compression and metaphor early, and the pattern holds through closure without confusing the reader. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Lena "translates the subtle vibration of metal into a language of emotion" without specific, idiosyncratic detail that distinguishes her way of noticing from any other contemplative protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the rune-scholar frame ("saturated hush," "luminous rune of purpose"). Perceptual signature is present (Lira notices glyphs, resonance, crystallization). However, syntactic patterns recur (many sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]"), and figurative density is high without always clarifying action. The phrase "smiled softly brightly" is an adverbial muddle. Filter verbs ("feeling," "watching") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("gossip‑column exorcist," "gritty, ethereal chorus," "fragrant bridge between apology and absolution") that reads consistent and apt for a ritualistic frame. The prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("induced currents of memory," "imperfect miracles") without grounding the exorcist's perceptual signature in concrete sensory bias. No dialogue present. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") appear but do not dull immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is elevated, lyric, and consistent in register—purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("resounding hush," "journeying inward while walking out") teach a rhythmic mode. However, POV interiority is absent; the focalizer remains distant, and perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. The lexicon ("wanderingly exact," "spiral arbitration") feels imposed rather than organic to the witness's mind. No dialogue appears; the piece is purely atmospheric narration with no embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric-philosophical register ("a paradox, a point that existed only while the observer kept count"). Perceptual signature is consistent but leans toward elevated diction that occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy ("eminently peculiar," "sediment in the still water"). No dialogue is present. The voice is coherent but does not modulate under pressure; the shepherd's internal texture remains uniform from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic academic-quest rather than character-specific; Mara's way of noticing does not reflect her gambling compulsion or her father's ledger obsession in her diction or syntax. Register drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("lucid contradictions," "theoretically rebellious") that feels authorial rather than Mara's lived lexicon under pressure. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. Sentence rhythm is workmanlike but lacks modulation; stress does not compress or accelerate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is stable, lyric, and atmospheric with a consistent elevated register ("melodically haunted," "ghostly arpeggios," "deliberate practice to sharpen the thin line"). Psychic distance remains controlled in third-person close. However, the diction is uniform across all moments—philosophical cadence persists even during Lena's call, where urgency might compress syntax—and Lena's voice is summarized rather than heard, missing an opportunity for dialogue distinction. The prose reads as singular and purposeful but lacks modulation under pressure and avoids on-page speech that could test voice variety.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (walnut-ink, sepia, violet-amber palette) and diction remains elevated throughout. However, register uniformity flattens pressure: "haunted euphoria," "regenerated covenant," and "proximate causes" recur as incantations without modulation. No dialogue. Psychic distance does not shift with scene stakes, and the prose reads as committee lyricism rather than a character-specific filter.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a whimsical, elevated register ("mute witness," "captive star," "coaxing discord into harmony") consistent throughout, but it does not modulate under pressure—the same lyric texture persists whether describing setting or supposed high-stakes retrieval. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but are not excessive. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic: Lira notices ivy, fragment warmth, laughter, but these observations do not reveal character-specific bias or blind spots. The voice reads as authorial rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction, long periodic sentences—that suits the premise. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature: Lira's blindness does not meaningfully shape what is noticed or how; the narration offers visual imagery ("silver," "glowed brighter," "quiet blaze") without reflecting her sensory constraints. Sentence stems vary adequately, but the rhythm stays uniform across beats, missing modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and maintains psychic distance, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("paradoxical steadiness," "tangled ribbons of light," "tapestry of intentional threads") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized") cluster in reflective beats without embodied immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic—"celestial signal interpreter" does not shape what or how the narrator notices. Rhythm is consistent but lacks modulation under the stated pressure of the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance through Arlen's sequence; Lira's arrival shifts focalization cleanly at a section break (Track C allowance applies). However, both characters share identical elevated diction ("luminous," "trembling chords," "bittersweet reminder") and perceptual metaphors, erasing voice distinction. Register remains consistently poetic buttonally uniform across emotional peaks and narrative beats; no modulation under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The prose texture is controlled but formulaic: "She lifted her hands... and felt the harbor respond" mirrors Arlen's sequence without syntactic variation, suggesting template cadence rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is stable in stance but generic in texture, relying on stock lyricism ("volcanic tenderness," "dust danced like ash," "narratives could melt steel") rather than character-particular perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") dull immediacy at key beats. Psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrator claims omniscient knowledge of future visitors' emotions ("felt the heat of compassion") without dramatization. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Lira is maintained, but psychic distance drifts into cosmic omniscience ("the universe seemed to inhale," "visitors who walked the garden's paths felt") without clear focalization shifts or section breaks. The prose carries a lyric, fairy-tale register ("whiskered cheek," "luminous orbs," "defiant lullaby") that is consistent but not character-particular—Lira's perceptual signature is indistinct from the narrator's cosmic frame. Diction remains elevated throughout without modulation for pressure, and no dialogue appears. Non-standard experimental patterning (cosmic breath, auroral sorrow) is taught early but does not deepen under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable single-character throughout. Diction suffers from elevated register drift ("calculated spontaneity," "moth's wing," "steel veins") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "noting") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is generic—Milo notices symbols, pulses, vibrations—without bias or selective attention rooted in his role or psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited to the guardian, with consistent psychic distance. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and abstract ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret") without character-specific rhythm or bias. The fisherman's whispered gratitude introduces a second perspective briefly without head-hopping. Figurative language ("lenses of polished steel," "tapestry of hope," "stitched stars") is poetic but generic, not tied to the guardian's particular way of noticing. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but Mara's perceptual signature is absent—no character-specific noticing or idiom. Diction drifts into elevated register ("palpable hum," "nascent rebellion," "cognitive gardens") inconsistent with an after-school coach's immediate thought. Dialogue is absent. No psychic distance modulation under pressure occurs; tone remains uniform across weeks and beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person narration maintains stable focalization but relies on elevated, poetic diction ("bruised horizon," "moon-struck daggers") that sometimes overrides character-specific perception. Mara's internal voice lacks idiomatic texture; her thoughts read as narrated theme ("the combat within herself") rather than embodied consciousness. Register shifts into mythic abstraction ("the sea's heart," "ancient summons") are consistent but distanced, flattening urgency. No dialogue; the whale's "hymn" and Mara's "whispered" song are summary.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and abstract ("morally ambiguous purpose," "emotional void") in ways inconsistent with a performer in a farmhouse. Register drifts into therapy-speak ("cultivate lightness," "quiet transformation") without anchoring in Mara's idiom. Psychic distance is poorly calibrated: the narration claims knowledge of "unseen residents" and broader social impact beyond what Mara can observe. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    Diction is elevated and consistent but drifts into poetic abstraction ("breath held in moonlight," "soft fire," "lantern-moth hush") without grounding in the focalizer's lived perception. Free indirect access is stable, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than character-specific bias. Register occasionally overreaches: "aesthetically driven," "resonance that is both personal and universal" read like external commentary. No head-hopping, and the voice maintains coherence, keeping the score mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (synesthetic color perception, attention to cracked tiles and uneven brushstrokes) but diction drifts into elevated register ("asymmetrical grace," "luminous cadence," "Conceptual Repricing") incongruous with a painter's embodied experience. Dialogue with the glassblower is brief and functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("felt the courtyard awaken," "perceived the world") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited. However, the voice converges on elevated, workshop-abstract diction throughout ("synaptic sparks," "neural pathways," "ritual that propelled humanity toward deeper empathy") regardless of narrative pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—the bell ringer notices in the same register as the omniscient frame. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, and filter use is controlled, preventing further score erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("subdued ardor," "phosphorescent glow," "quiet oath") and stable third-limited POV without head-hopping. However, diction is uniform and leans decorative; the narrator's perceptual signature does not shift under pressure or reveal character-specific bias. Template cadence appears in runs like "She decided...she would...she would...Each crane was..." and figurative density (veils, curtains, filaments, constellations) pervades without modulation, flattening urgency across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the piece sustains a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, the diction is often generic-literary ("chorus that reminded her why she chose to confide her doubts to the night") and template-patterned in structure ("She believed that by…she could…; She realized that…; She imagined…"). No dialogue. The perceptual signature is poetic but not character-particular—any seer could narrate this way. Voice remains consistent but lacks the specificity or rhythmic modulation that would charge peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable (third limited), and the prose carries elevated diction ("saffron-veil historian," "anguished joy," "vortex of forgotten childhoods"). However, register drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("atoms of nostalgia coalesce," "purposeful misstep, a dance of randomness") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible on-page lexicon during peak moments. Perceptual signature is generic; the historian's way of noticing reads interchangeable with default literary narration. No dialogue present. Narrative certainty remains consistent, but voice lacks character-particular texture or rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but the narrative voice is generic and ornamental—"soft perfume of rain-kissed clouds," "symphony of remembrance"—without character-particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance floats: the narrator claims omniscient certainty ("the universe had placed each fragment") beyond what the protagonist can plausibly know. Diction drifts into elevated register ("metamorphose," "luminous regret") that feels imported rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; interior texture is abstract and interchangeable, lacking the specificity needed to lift the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited focalization with a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the tone. Perceptual signature is present in the mist-and-light imagery, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract generality ("fragile convictions," "quietly vivid resolve"). No head-hopping or POV leakage occurs. The voice modulates minimally across the single continuous scene, and no dialogue appears to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narration is first-person singular with stable distance and no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but frequently elevated and abstract ("meteor hush," "stalwart root," "molten glass"), creating a homogenous lyric register that does not modulate under pressure—descending into the tunnel carries the same cadence as receiving revelation. The moss dialogue ("You seek the scar stories, too") and root's "question in images" are told rather than shown in distinct perceptual textures. Perceptual signature is present (scar-reader lens) but the prose does not reflect urgency or degradation at peak moments. Filter-free direct perception appears sporadically but is often buried under elevated phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific. Diction drifts into elevated register ("spatially imaginative labyrinth," "constellations waiting for a story to give them shape") that reads authorial rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. Figurative language dominates without variation: every beat converts to metaphor ("tiny birds perched on frames," "river of memory," "telescope that surveyed the inner universe"), flattening rhythm and obscuring concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV distance is stable (third-limited), but the narrative voice is generic elevated-fantasy register with no perceptual signature specific to this character. Diction throughout ("shadowed rapture," "aurora-lit," "moonstruck") is interchangeable poetic stock without syntactic or rhythmic variation tied to the dreamer's mind. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are attempted, but the effect flattens into synonym churn ("verses," "poems," "chorus," "symphony") rather than a taught pattern that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific—"odd tug," "surge of longing," "fleeting warmth" could describe many protagonists. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, which fits the lyric tone but does not modulate with pressure; peak moments (archive unfolding, trees rising) maintain the same register as quieter beats, reducing rhythmic contrast. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent texture but lacks a distinct, irreplaceable voice that would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous echo," "coiled like a vine," "steel sky") but borders on purple without grounding in the character's particular perceptual filter—the philosopher's voice feels generic rather than individual. No dialogue appears. Register remains literary throughout; purposeful compression is absent. The prose maintains a single textural mode without modulation under pressure, and the narrator's "way of noticing" does not reflect character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("dreaming clouds," "sea's sighs") and a stable third-person limited stance on Mira. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the narration occasionally drifts toward poetic assertion ("reclaimed the courage that had waited in silence") rather than Mira's immediate perception. No dialogue appears; interiority is filtered but abstract at peak beats, relying on therapy-adjacent phrases ("map of the inner self," "unused courage") that weaken specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited collective ("the guests"), with no head-hopping into the bellhop's interiority. Perceptual signature is generic—observations like "frostbitten hope that clung to their throats" and "seraphically mundane" read as authorial register rather than character-filtered perception. Diction is uniform across beats: elevated, deliberate phrasing ("unpardonable silence," "nerve regeneration experiment") that never modulates under pressure or fractures into sharper urgency. No dialogue. The final paragraph's summative tone ("they carried with them the memory") softens closure instead of charging it. Free indirect style is absent; the narration observes from outside rather than inhabiting a distinct mind.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent high-fantasy register ("vaulted aisles," "faded glyphs," "trembling fingers"). Diction is elevated throughout, matching the setting, but the titan's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic noticing distinguishes his mind. Key moments lean on abstract metaphor ("presence that felt almost planetary," "power regally unpretentious") rather than concrete perception. The single line of dialogue ("the throne would belong only to one whose blood matches the original line") reads stiff and expository, telling rather than acting. Filter verbs cluster lightly ("felt," "seemed") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.0)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with Mara as anchor, but interiority is abstract—"her mind was periodically eternal" reads as placeholder rather than character-specific perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("moored yet drifting," "a testament to listening") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Diction veers into elevated register ("thunderous serenity," "paradox," "resonant frequencies") that clashes with barefoot physicality and lacks perceptual signature—what she notices reads generic rather than character-specific. Purposeful compression ("whispered a question," "lifted the opera glasses once more") creates rhythm but also flattens immediacy. No dialogue; voice remains consistent but abstract, without the grit or idiom that would anchor the focalizer's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice leans toward elevated lyricism ("insurgent grandmother," "broken prayer," "living bridge") that sometimes drifts into abstraction ("implanted destiny," "collective growth"). Diction is consistent but generic; no perceptual signature makes Anara's way of noticing distinct. Psychic distance remains mid-range throughout; no modulation under pressure. Dialogue is absent. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "saw") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy in this register. The prose reads competent but lacks the rhythmic control or specificity to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature is consistent (survivor's lens filtering wind, gulls, scent). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("orb of calm," "cadence," "tangible echo") that reads polished but not always character-particular under grief. The spoken promise at the sapling is grammatically smooth and thematically aligned, yet lacks the compression or ellipsis one might expect mid-crisis. No head-hopping; voice is controlled but not charged under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elian throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (artist's eye for "map of light and shadow," "mosaic of reclaimed pieces") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("rhetorical sigh, a mirror held up") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the descent. No dialogue present. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("wondered," "whispered"). Narrative stance is lyric and coherent, though word choice sometimes prioritizes atmosphere over specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael, and diction is elevated throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—Kael's tracker profession and albino experience do not shape what he notices or how he processes stress. Repeated sentence stems ("The drone…," "Kael…") and stock figurative phrases ("bleached bone," "dying star," "fragile thread") flatten rhythm. The piece reads more as atmospheric narration than a mind under pressure, and the final declaration feels authorial rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maren; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vellum rose like skeletal trees," "contraband truths spread like frost on glass"), creating a lyric texture. However, the prose leans on repeated constructions: "dangerous liaison letter" appears five times, "dormant networks" six times, "bravely conflicted" twice, "echoing library under snow" four times, creating a template cadence that flattens momentum. Perceptual signature is generic; Maren's way of noticing does not feel character-specific. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("felt the tremor," "knew the letter had arrived") appear but do not muddle immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet"), though the repeated phrase "tranquil blaze" and stock figurative language ("rustle of sandbags," "thorns glinting like tiny swords") flatten texture. Perceptual signature is declared ("senselessly perceptive") but not demonstrated through selective, character-specific noticing under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinct perceptual signature (sound as tactile, emotions as currents). No dialogue present. POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, elevated diction ("transliterates," "voicing silence") occasionally drifts from a fisher's plausible lexicon without voice-motivated justification. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative stance fits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira. However, perceptual signature is generic: "soft pewter," "floating thought," "solemn playfulness" are literary ornaments not filtered through character-specific priorities. The journalist's dialogue ("He laughed… promised to publish with reverence and wit") converges with the narrator's elevated register. Mira's interior voice uses academic diction ("proof by contradiction," "hypothesis," "false premise") that reads as prompt echo rather than embodied thought under pressure. Orientation debt (Q2) caps Q6 at 7.8, and line-level register drift lowers the score within that ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with phrases like "constellation tattooist," "meteor hush," and "time folds in on itself." However, diction occasionally slips into generic elevated phrasing ("unwavering resolve," "collective cry and exhaled calm") that lacks character-particular texture. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. POV remains stable third-person limited on Lyra, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but muted—descriptions lean toward atmospheric catalog rather than character-specific noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Liora, with a brief clean shift to the violinist in the final beat marked by a section-like pause. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") but veers into prompt-echo phrases that feel assembled rather than lived. The tile's dialogue substitute—"a ripple of silence"—avoids naturalism issues but borders on over-figuration. No head-hopping, but voice lacks perceptual signature; Liora and the violinist notice in nearly identical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "tapestry of muted dawn") that does not modulate under pressure. The protagonist's interiority consists of thematic declarations rather than character-specific perception. No other character speaks or thinks on the page, so voice distinction is not testable. The prose reads as authorial philosophizing rather than filtered through a singular, lived perspective with perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to the ghost until the shopkeeper's late arrival, which introduces a brief focalization shift ("She felt the ghost's longing"). Diction is elevated and consistent—"synesthetically blessed," "liquid violet," "luminous chime"—but verges on ornamental register during high-pressure beats without voice-specific grounding. The ghost's perceptual signature (colors that hum, scent-guided drift) is present but decorative; it does not constrain perception or choice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains steady but the prose reads generic-lyric rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice remains stable in third-person limited, and POV boundaries hold without head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into technical-abstract register ("somatic markers," "fractally precise intervals," "neural resonance") that feels more like prompt-echo than character-specific perception. Mara's internal texture does not modulate under pressure; her thought patterns remain equally articulate and conceptually fluent throughout, never degrading into urgency or sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric texture ("factually mystical," "lantern-like droplets"), and psychic distance remains stable throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("oracle," "chorus of forgotten tides") that reads more writerly than character-particular. No dialogue is present to test for voice distinction. Purposeful compression is legible, but the final paragraph's tonal convergence feels more atmospheric than internally driven.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains a consistent lyric register. However, voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction is generic-literary ("unearthed silence," "quiet music of resolved destiny") and could describe any mystical quest. Psychic distance remains uniformly remote, with no modulation under pressure. Internal monologue ("She understood," "She realized") relies on filter verbs and summary rather than embodied perception. No dialogue is present to test subtext or character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent but diction drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe the secret," "luminous river," "phoenix") that clashes with the spy's concrete mission and ash-marked body. Perceptual signature is generic; the spy notices symbolic resonance (constellations, courage, forgiveness) rather than tactical detail. No dialogue. Free indirect style is clean but the voice lacks character-specific texture—rhythms and word choice could belong to any lyric fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Arlen; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, often slipping into unmotivated poeticism ("spindrift serenity," "percolate through awareness"). Psychic distance stays consistent but the narrative voice reads decorative rather than character-specific—Arlen's perceptual signature is generic contemplation. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm supports the meditative tone but lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Mara's perception. Diction is consistent—"zen-minded," "sharp gentleness," "phototropic to kindness"—though occasionally elevated ("benediction," "lattice of memory") in ways that feel more authorial than character-specific. No head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional beats (hush, thrum intensifies, sigh at closure) but lacks a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices in poetic generalities rather than idiosyncratic detail. Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice serves the lyric-accumulative mode without slipping into filter-verb stacks or expository intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature (moonbeams, feeble glow, quivering hush) reads as Mara's selective attention. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous harbor by moonlight, silver ribbons dancing," "wistfully pragmatic," "photon reflected") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, and filter verbs cluster in key beats ("She felt a protected vulnerability," "she felt the quivering hush settle"). Syntactic patterns repeat (many sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]"), flattening rhythm under pressure and reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but diction oscillates between lyric specificity ("translucent ribs forming arches") and elevated abstraction ("delicate beginnings of new consciousness," "bridge between extinction and living") that exceeds the POV's grounded lexicon. Perceptual signature is generic—Mira "feels," "understands," "records" without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in peak beats without embodied anchoring, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mira. Diction is elevated and consistent ("sequined ribbons," "vaulted ceiling blossomed with constellations") but not character-particular—register reads generic lyric rather than Mira's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she sensed") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.4)
    Narrative distance drifts between close third and panoramic summary without purposeful modulation; Mara's perceptual signature is generic elevated diction ("restless static, a canvas") that does not reflect an astronomer's trained attention. Diction climbs into abstraction ("ethereal pulse that nudged the minds of students") incongruent with a character under technical pressure. The piece teaches no clear POV pattern, and the final expansion to valley-wide chorus abandons single-POV cohesion without section breaks or a taught mosaic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    Register drifts into elevated diction ("bittersweet resonance," "wistful rebellion") that clashes with the urgency of claustrophobic exploration. Perceptual signature is generic: the explorer notices mood and metaphor rather than tool-feel or breath-count under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks character-specific lexicon—"prudently adventurous" and "transfixing his senses" read as narrator overlay. Psychic distance flattens when peak stress (entering the new corridor) is narrated in the same ornate cadence as calm exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara, but interiority is filled with abstract declarations ("she believed," "she imagined," "she felt") rather than character-specific perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("alchemy," "furrowed hush," "lance of pigment") that does not reflect a face-blind artist's sensory hierarchy. The quarry is granted agency ("the quarry seemed to respond," "the quarry responded with a sudden crack") without clear filter, blurring focalization. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance remains consistent but distant, with no embodied immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.3)
    Focalization remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (spongey dread, wind charts as "swirling") is consistent if somewhat stylized. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("reversible exile," "symphonic" turbines, "symphonic" is not in the text but the tone is similarly abstract) that does not read as a librarian's lived idiom under stress. Dialogue is absent, so no dialogue bullets apply. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("feeling the spongey dread settle into resolve") dull immediacy in peak beats, but the voice remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric register ("twilight draped the peaks," "every note is a map"), but the diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("dynamically observant," "pixelated amnesty") that feels imposed rather than character-bound. The fiddler's perceptual signature is consistent—he notices wind, light, echoes—but the texture is generic poetic rather than idiosyncratically his. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the delivery. The prose performs lyricism competently but the voice lacks specificity: any mystic musician could narrate these lines without alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds steadily on Arlen; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose carries a consistent, slightly elevated register ("dusky harmony," "polished calm") that matches the reflective, observational stance but risks convergence with the narrative voice—Arlen's internal texture is hard to distinguish from authorial description. Dialogue with Maya is brief and functional, lacking subtext or goal pursuit. The perceptual signature leans on the "polished calm" motif but does not modulate under the startup crash; stress should narrow or distort perception, yet the syntax and diction remain uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register. However, diction frequently overreaches—"letting the midnight solace…seep into her bones," "whispered a prayer of gratitude"—into pseudo-poetic phrasing that blurs specificity. Perceptual signature is generic: Mara notices "glyphs that glowed," "stars flickered," without character-particular selectivity. No dialogue appears. Voice remains stable but lacks the texture and urgency needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance wavers between close ("she feels," "she knows") and elevated stock phrasing ("her presence a calm blade ready for battle"). The prose drifts into generic mystical register ("promises of future battles fought with the same calm steel") that reads detached from the druid's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present; voice distinction is not testable. Diction is consistent but lacks character-particular rhythm or selective attention—every detail is narrated with equal weight, flattening urgency. The opening simile ("like distant drums," "like a wounded bird," "like silver birds") establishes a lyric texture that does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is distant third with stable focalization, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with the character's perceptual signature ("pliant ribbon," "filament of color weaving a tapestry"). Sentence openings repeat stems: "She [verb]" appears in nine consecutive beats without variation. No distinct perceptual bias shapes what the visionary notices; descriptions read as authorial catalog rather than character filter. Psychic distance remains constant with no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans heavily on elevated, sometimes strained constructions ("trammel against despair," "susurrus," "dusky resolve") that feel imposed rather than character-particular. The prose exhibits register drift—vocabulary oscillates between gothic ornamentation and modern abstraction ("conduits of memory," "shared renewal") without a clear perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("feeling," "recognizing," "understood") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent in register but relies on template cadence and repetitive stems: "I felt," "I realized," "I whispered," "I pulled." Psychic distance is stable but diction inflates into lyric abstraction ("valley longing," "confidently uncertain") that clashes with the ex-roadie's established idiom. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("letting the echo...mingle") reads as helpful narrator syndrome rather than earned POV perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated diction and a measured, observational distance appropriate to Lira's scholarly character. However, register drifts into expository mode during peak moments ("analogical thinking could coax the seed to germinate, linking the unseen currents..."), flattening immediacy. Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("felt the distance close," "sensing the shift") dominate where embodied perception would sharpen focus. The narrative stance remains stable but lacks perceptual signature—Lira's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific, and her interior voice during the seed's transformation offers conceptual summary rather than in-the-moment sensory particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with perceptual filters anchored to the librarian's role and mechanical nature. Diction is elevated and consistent ("wintersun serenity," "ripple-patterned"), though several register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("identity itself accepts contradictions") weaken immediacy at key beats. The piece employs purposeful compression and lyric patterning (tidal imagery, moon-phase recurrence) that the text teaches early and sustains. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled; the librarian's way of noticing (gears turning, creel whispering) is character-specific. Under peak stress the voice softens rather than tightens, a choice that serves the wintersun tone but flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.9)
    Single POV is stable, but the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—diction is uniformly elevated ("resonant hush," "quartz refracting light into prisms that whispered ancient lullabies") without grounding in Mara's professional lens or emotional state. Filter verbs ("feeling," "understanding," "felt") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as a committee narrator guiding the reader through symbolic stations rather than a character experiencing pressure. No dialogue appears; internal voice is generic and interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single first-person POV is stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: "daringly methodical," attuned to map references, graffiti wisdom, and river truth. Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric ("disused railway station, its cracked tiles swallowed by ivy"), voice-motivated for a reflective chronicler. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("cartography of the soul," "inevitable erosion") that feels imposed rather than lived. No dialogue. Sentence rhythm varies but some stems recur ("I lifted," "I traced," "I drew," "I felt"), creating mild template cadence. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    POV is stable first-person, but the narrative voice is generic and tonally flat—"cautious exuberance" is labeled rather than rhythmically embodied. Perceptual signature is absent: the narrator notices "halos," "murmurs," "glyphs" in undifferentiated catalog fashion. The veiled dreamer has no distinct speech or interior texture; her two lines of dialogue ("Each petal holds a promise…") could belong to anyone. Filter verbs ("I noted," "We realized," "I recorded") cluster without voice motivation, and stock constructions ("heart swelling") recur. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but the register drifts into elevated abstraction ("perforated destiny," "autonomous skyward garden") that exceeds Elara's plausible lexicon under pressure. The narrative voice is ornamental rather than character-particular; syntax and diction do not modulate with stakes. Psychic distance is inconsistent: we access Elara's "mulberry ache" but the envoy's eyes "filled with the same mulberry ache" without access to his interiority. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic rather than selective.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt. Diction is elevated and consistent ("radiant hush," "lucidly watchful," "threshold of stillness") with a lyric, ceremonial register that fits the beautician mortician's reverent stance. Perceptual signature is present: she notices light, vibration, and pattern. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, the voice risks decorative uniformity—nearly every sentence carries the same meditative rhythm and high register, which flattens urgency even during the climactic infusion. Syntactic variety is limited; most sentences follow subject-verb-modifier arcs without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (care-focused, attuned to vines and stone) is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("scalloping," "umbral," "phosphorescent lichen") which fits the contemplative tone but occasionally edges into ornament ("its quiet breath echoing the vineyard hush"). Elision is purposeful (the betrayal is compressed to "forgiving the unforgivable") and the narrative distance remains controlled. However, under peak pressure—the sunrise alignment—the prose does not modulate; it maintains the same meditative register, missing an opportunity to tighten rhythm and sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara, and the prose establishes a lyric, elevated register. However, diction drifts into abstraction and thesis-speak at pressure points: "sincerely insincere in her professional vows," "a vow of protected vulnerability," "a living conversation, a promise to listen as much as to judge." Perceptual signature is generic—wind, sea, stone, light—without character-particular filtering. The final beats stack filter constructions and explanatory interiority ("reminding herself that even a conscience for hire must listen to its own murmur") that flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent meditative register. Diction leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("moonlit tide," "cipher for delayed revelation," "sycamore hush") that risks generic lyricism. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature is contemplative and image-driven but not character-particular; another protagonist could narrate these observations with minor adjustment. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression and sensory specificity ("wings cutting the thin air like knives"). However, perceptual signature is generic—observations could belong to any reverent observer rather than this particular "harmonic stone skimmer." Filter verbs ("feeling," "letting") dull immediacy in peak beats, and the final lines slip into abstract summary ("calm as the echoing canyon") that deflates the established texture. Single-POV with no dialogue; judged on interior coherence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, interior access clean. However, the prose carries an elevated, lyric register throughout ("garden folly keystone," "brilliant dimness," "accommodates impossibilities") that remains uniform under pressure, lacking the perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation expected from an "underachieving mage" in crisis. Diction stays ornate and abstract even at the keystone touch, where embodied simplicity would serve the theme. No dialogue is present. The voice reads as authorial-poetic rather than character-particular, with repeated template phrasing ("lingering luminance" appears seven times) that flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose establishes a consistent lyrical register with a distinct perceptual signature (meteor hush, luminous vow, salt-filled gloom). However, the narrator's voice relies on stock poetic constructions and elevated diction that flatten under repetition: "whispered in a tone," "a quiet river of stars," "a sleeping leviathan." Free indirect style is clean, and POV remains stable, but the rhythmic control is monotonous—most sentences follow a similar length and cadence, creating a drumbeat effect that dulls propulsion. No elision serves closure or imposes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable single third-person, distance is consistent, and diction is generally controlled. However, the prose relies on stock metaphors ("thread through the cracks of time," "grand symphony of contraction") and elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak—Silas's way of noticing is generic rather than selective and biased in character-specific ways. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation. No dialogue is present, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose establishes a lyric register ("dripping with the sighs of unkept promises") but drifts into elevated diction that exceeds plausible focalizer lexicon during high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is generic—Lira notices in predictable poetic ways. Psychic distance stays consistent, but the voice lacks distinct rhythm or idiomatic particularity; the cadence feels templated across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("frozen river of light," "shards of sky," "ghostly echo") is elevated and poetic but consistent within a lyric register. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the mage notices in catalog fashion (bell, droplets, light) without bias or selective attention. Free indirect access to the mage's earnest belief works cleanly, though vocabulary ("cosmic imbalance," "harmonious design") drifts toward abstract philosophy rather than lived idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Caitlyn with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is generic (eyes scanning, heart beating with calm certainty) without character-specific bias. Register drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush," "collective memory now reclaimed") that exceeds plausible focalizer lexicon under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Purposeful compression not evident; opacity comes from vague metaphor rather than taught pattern. Free indirect style is clean, but voice lacks distinct texture—could describe any warden in any town.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistently lyric-elevated but reads as generic fantasy-prose rather than Selene's particular perceptual signature. Diction ("phosphorescent snow," "feathered scripts," "silent verses") maintains register but lacks character-specific bias or urgency modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose does not compress or sharpen when the crystal explodes or the flame turns amber—moments that warrant heightened immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the seeker; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—"midnight pattern seeker," "muscle memory," "tactile promise"—creates a reverent, observant texture. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("nocturnal arbor," "vaulted dome," "muted conversation between sky and earth") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted, especially during peak action (harness revision). The piece sustains a single lyric mood without modulation under pressure. Dialogue is absent; the outpost crew's gratitude is rendered as "without words," a choice that fits the tone but forecloses a test of voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable with no head-hopping, and Kael's perceptual filter (ego-death lens) is consistent in concept if abstract in execution. Diction leans elevated ("vivifying," "emancipation," "stewardship") without clear character motivation for the register; under peak pressure the prose remains declarative rather than fragmenting or sharpening. The few dialogue lines (Guardians "demand," Syndicate "shouted," Mara's question) lack subtext or distinct idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, but filter verbs ("felt," "understood") cluster in summary beats without adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated, image-dense, metaphor-heavy—but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature; it reads as authorial atmosphere rather than the conductor's specific way of noticing. Diction remains uniform across beats without modulation under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.6)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited with purposeful uncertainty ("she—if the term could fit"), and the perceptual signature leans toward abstraction ("lattice of interiorized exteriors"). However, register drifts into academic-philosophical phrasing ("delineating the shifting boundaries," "foggy lucidity") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible lexicon, especially in peak beats. Pronoun inconsistency ("she" / "it") within paragraphs reads unintentional rather than thematically motivated. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the voice maintains a lyric register throughout. However, diction drifts into generic elevated phrasing ("silent promise," "whispered promise," "quiet triumph") that could describe any contemplative protagonist. Perceptual signature is weak: the alchemist notices in committee-voice abstractions rather than through a distinctive sensory or conceptual filter. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "realized") cluster without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice flattens into a uniform register of elevated diction ("serenely electric," "melodic line of creation," "practical magic") that reads more as authorial commentary than Selin's character-specific perception. Under peak pressure—climbing the antenna, interfacing the shard—the prose maintains the same lyric distance rather than tightening or fragmenting to reflect stress. The lack of dialogue (none on the page) is not penalized, but the single-voice interiority offers little perceptual signature beyond generic fantasy-engineer idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ardent," "spectral," "phosphorescent threads") that feels ornamental rather than rooted in Lio's perceptual signature. The prose has texture, but interior access remains thin—Lio observes and acts without much concrete thought or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.7)
    Narrative distance is unstable: free indirect drifts into omniscient aesthetic judgment ("realistically imaginary choreography") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible lexicon. Register veers between elevated metaphor ("liquid glass," "translucent connections") and prompt-speak ("rational enchantment," "texture of connection"). The protagonist's perceptual signature is absent—every image feels like the same authorial voice describing for the reader rather than filtered through character urgency. No dialogue present; mono-POV voice lacks specificity or pressure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited voice maintains stable distance and uses some specific vocabulary (benthic, lattice, edge geometry), but diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated register ("mournful blue," "somber marvel," "collective sigh of somber marvel") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Sentence structure is rhythmically uniform with many long, clause-stacked lines. The single line of quoted dialogue ("how a simple chain link could hold the key…") and the "whispered" promise both read as thematic summary rather than natural speech or interior thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("reeling hush," "cartographer of sighs," "filament of memory") that reads as purposeful compression. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fragile beats that survive," "bridge that linked the living and the dead") that blurs rather than sharpens the moment. No dialogue appears; the single-POV interiority is stable, but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains mid-range throughout without purposeful modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("I sensed," "I felt") appear but are not intrusive enough to penalize heavily at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the opening line establishes a lyric register ("hulking mouth," "crashing hush") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Mara notices facility details in a way that could suit any cautious explorer. No dialogue appears, so character distinction is not tested. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear in moderate density without overwhelming immediacy. The final paragraph's "quiet triumph" and "claustrophobic heart finally at ease" tip into tell-summary that asserts resolution rather than trusting the image to land it.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Narrative distance is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register ("shimmering cascade of code," "midnight solace"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral patterns," "crystalline whispers") that does not feel character-specific or grounded in Mara's professional lens. Filter verbs and passive constructions cluster in high-pressure beats ("she realized," "she knew"), dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing does not reflect a scientist's bias or embodied state under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is ornate and consistent ("copper-veined," "canyon of endless echoes," "audible sculpture") with a lyric, archaic register. POV distance is stable; psychic access remains shallow and controlled. However, diction often drifts into abstract elevation ("quietly articulate," "resonant reconfiguration," "fragile hymn") that sits uneasily with embodied perception. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the storyteller's way of noticing is poetic but interchangeable with any mythic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable first-person, but perceptual signature is generic: "breath fogging," "the weight of years of dead ends," "the laughter of the beast ripple through me" could belong to any narrator. Diction drifts into elevated register ("metamorphose any who listened into a vessel of its own laughter," "gravitationally playful echo") that clashes with moment-to-moment urgency. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static; peak moments (arrowhead shattering, garden sealing) receive the same remote, catalog-like treatment as transit beats. The prose texture is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence structures and opening patterns ("I realized," "I felt," "I walked") repeat without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the violinist with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("resonantly soft," "tarnished wonder," "sky-bridge"), though the diction reads as authorial rather than character-particular—no perceptual signature distinguishes this narrator's way of noticing from generic high-fantasy narration. Sentence rhythms remain uniform (subject-verb declaratives, parallel structures) without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Milo with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("banner of surrender," "metallic bird," "muted silver") that remains coherent but does not modulate under peak pressure; the storm-climax and rival-salute beats maintain the same ornate diction as the opening, flattening urgency. Perceptual signature is generic: Milo notices neon, hush, and horizon in ways that could belong to any contemplative observer. The prose is clean and grammatical but syntactically uniform, with many long sentences that embed multiple clauses in parallel cadence, creating a drumbeat rhythm that never shifts for action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") reads as authorial ornament rather than character-specific idiom. No dialogue. Register drifts into elevated lyric diction ("celestial shard," "tapestry of muted stars") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Free indirect style is attempted but filter verbs ("She understood," "She realized," "She felt") stack heavily in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—"invisible lines across the vaulted ceiling," "angles that only a mind tuned to both poetry and quantum mechanics could discern"—is specific to Mara and lends voice texture. Diction ("sanely eccentric," "observed solitude," "transient constellations") stays elevated and consistent. However, the prose at peak moments (scarf aligning, ripple reaching atrium) relies on abstract nouns ("resonance," "reawakening," "communion") rather than embodied perception, dulling immediacy and capping the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara until the brief shift to Lio, which occurs at a clear paragraph break and does not head-hop. Diction is elevated and lyrical but uniform throughout—"luminous absence," "cipher of longing," "hush of improbable beginnings"—creating a drone rather than modulating with pressure. Perceptual signature is vague; Mara's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Register remains consistent but lacks the embodied texture or micro-choices that would anchor voice to Mara's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    Psychic distance is stable and the piece maintains a consistent elevated register throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: every description relies on stock lyricism ("sigh over a shadowed nexus," "tapestry woven from forgotten dreams," "veil of doubt") without character-specific idiom or bias. Diction drifts into abstraction ("enveloped secrets," "improbable longing," "hush of cosmic possibility") that no single focalizer would plausibly narrate in the moment. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose texture is uniform, with identical cadence and metaphor density across emotional peaks and calmer beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV distance remains stable, and sensory filtering (brine, amber light through hulls, salt on tongue) reads consistent with the folklorist's attention. However, the voice drifts toward elevated register ("a feeling she had chased since childhood," "the power of a chronically curious soul") that feels more narrator-summary than embodied perception under pressure. Diction at peak beats (the memory-surge, the ritual completion) stays in explanatory mode rather than tightening to immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (shard-mirror archivist noting fractured memories, geometry, and light) is character-specific. However, the diction drifts into elevated register ("vaulted hall," "reversible pilgrimage," "luminous shards") that feels authorial rather than rooted in the focalizer's working idiom, especially during high-pressure moments. The whispered dialogue ("You will not be exiled again; I will guard your stories as fiercely as I guard my own heart") sounds like written exposition rather than spoken thought. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the narrative stance is controlled, but the voice lacks the contradictory rhythms that would reflect genuine stress.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Single third-person POV holds without head-hopping. Diction is uniformly elevated and poetic ("insatiably creative," "verdant parapet," "luminous spores," "harmonic thread") with no variation under stress; the pruner's perceptual signature is indistinguishable from the narrator's lyricism. Register never modulates: storm, seed-crack, and traveler's plea all receive the same ornamental treatment. No distinct interior rhythm or character-specific filter; voice reads as committee consensus rather than a singular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("interlaced hush," "exhume," "lucid unrest") that remains internally consistent but drifts into thesaurus-itis and abstract diction unsuited to moment-by-moment perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific: Elara notices prism colors and pulse but offers no idiosyncratic filtering. No dialogue is present. The prose reads as committee lyric—beautifully textured in places but lacking a singular, grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but narratively certain beyond the protagonist's plausible knowledge: "the ancient henge's energy to seep into the chapel's stone, restoring a forgotten rhythm" claims metaphysical fact. Diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("rain-scoured," "bruised purple") and vague abstraction ("intangible grief," "shielded openness"). Perceptual signature is generic; the protagonist notices in catalog fashion (shadows, glyphs, raindrops) without bias or blind spots. No dialogue; interior voice feels assembled rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (algae, corroded brass) but voice lacks character-specific diction—register drifts into academic abstraction ("physics of letting go," "luminous path of release") during peak beats. Free indirect style is clean. Diction stays within educated observer range but becomes generic philosophical rather than Mort-particular under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the balladeer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, archaic register ("seldom-heard," "driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") that remains consistent. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with embodied action: "articulate unspoken needs," "algorithm," "binary sighs" mix metaphysical and technical registers without clear POV filter. The perceptual signature leans poetic but lacks character-specific bias—description feels authored rather than filtered through the balladeer's particular worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, distance consistent, and voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("frozen lighthouse," "sea of clouds," "lullaby of forgotten mirth"). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("pervasive contentment," "resilience of those who ascend") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue to test distinctness. Filter verbs ("feeling the weight," "seemed to pulse") are frequent but voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. Diction leans elevated ("litany," "stitching the broken seam with threads of light") and remains coherent, though some phrases ("quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness") recur without fresh inflection. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Aria's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias beyond the professional frame. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited is stable and the perceptual signature is lyric and image-dense. However, the prose recycles stems ("fractally precise," "secret book safe," "centuries-old coin") and the character's face-blindness never filters perception in character-specific ways. The narration asserts facts Lira cannot see: "the sky inside the library seemed to inhale" reads as external omniscience. No dialogue is present; internal voice is consistent but not distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization; no head-hopping. Diction tilts elevated ("sociable isolation," "stranded luminance," "polyglot's phrasebook") in ways that sometimes clash with immediate scene needs—peak beats carry metaphorical density ("living constellations," "pocket of stranded luminance") rather than urgent perception. Perceptual signature is generic scholarly wonder without character-specific bias. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric distance and poetic register ("filament of light that curled like a whisper," "heartbeat steadied"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("pulse that steadied broken time," "lullaby for the ages") that reads more like thematic label than lived perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable, but the focalizer's perceptual signature is generic—he notices beauty and mystery without character-specific bias or blind spot.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person distant omniscient POV remains stable but generic—no perceptual signature distinguishes Liora's noticing from the narrator's. Diction drifts into elevated register ("altruistic," "nebula of respite," "brambled hope") that feels prompt-imposed rather than voice-rooted. Dialogue is functional but bland; the child's read-aloud line carries no subtext or character-specific idiom. No psychic distance modulation under pressure; the prose narrates rather than inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with purposeful compression ("breath a thin thread of frost," "scarred thumb") that suits the tone. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vouchsafe a moment of stillness," "marrow of the sea") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose teaches its patterned diction early. Elara's perceptual signature—focused on symbolic resonance—is coherent but lacks the idiosyncratic bias that would distinguish her worldview under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent narrative distance and perceptual filter (orchard as patient surgeon, wind-traced patterns). Diction sustains a lyric, archaic register ("whispered rain," "latent heat," "bitter sweetness") that matches the cursed-orchard frame. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the caretaker's noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias or selective attention shaped by personal stakes. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression (wind impressions "only the birds can see") is legible, though some lines ("offhandedly exact," "jagged elegance") veer toward decorative metaphor without clear purpose-driven control.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("symphonically minded") is asserted but manifests unevenly—wind as "movements in a grand score" feels imposed rather than woven through her choices. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("translucent bridge... conduit of light") that clashes with on-page action. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person POV anchored to the vendor; no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—elevated diction ("vapor‑woven aisles," "fragmentary tone," "integrated fragmentation") remains constant rather than modulating under pressure, and the vendor's interiority consists of abstract philosophical observations without character-specific idiom. The child's brief dialogue ("whispering that the moonlight could fill the gaps") reads as thematic summary rather than embodied speech. Distance and tense are stable, but the prose lacks a distinct texture that separates this narrator from any other contemplative observer.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lir's perceptual signature evident in culinary metaphors ("bitter as burnt cumin," "dissolve like sugar in rainwater"). Psychic distance is controlled and the voice modulates effectively between lyric elevation and grounded sensory anchors. However, diction occasionally drifts into register mismatch—"subsume," "non-sequitur," "baseline physical constraints"—that feels writerly rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears; interiority relies heavily on metaphor without micro-choices that would anchor the voice to present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and some distinct texture ("harmonious choral," "citadel of gears"), but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous tenderness," "beats of compassion") that clashes with the librarian's presumed POV. Filter verbs and passive constructions appear frequently ("She believed," "she felt," "were etched"). No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic: the librarian "hears" and "listens" without idiosyncratic bias. Purposeful compression is not taught, and the final image's lyricism does not resolve ambiguity or elision paid off earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person close on Aria, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("liquid quartz," "quaking reverie," "spiraling like DNA"). However, register drifts into elevated, abstracted diction ("entangled memories," "synaptic plasticity," "helix-minded") that sits uneasily with the immediacy of scene pressure, especially in peak beats where embodied perception would sharpen urgency. Psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose: Aria's interiority alternates between concrete action (pressing palm to mirror) and high-concept formulation (treating mineral veins as brain tissue) in ways that flatten rather than modulate emotional intensity. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a steady register of elevated, metaphor-dense prose. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("threshold effects activating," "serpentine grotto in mist," "combinations resolved into a single luminous glyph") that reads more like prompt fulfillment than character-specific perception. Liora's interiority lacks a distinct perceptual signature; her observations of the grotto and glyph are generically poetic rather than filtered through the priorities of an archivist. Psychic distance remains stable but the prose texture does not modulate under the pressure of the gravity inversion or symbol alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains third-limited to Auris with stable distance, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("symphonically minded," "intensely quiet"). However, diction drifts into elevated register that strains against the focalizer's plausible lexicon ("conduit of feeling," "resonant bridge," "tangible current"), and several phrases recur without variation ("empathy in motion" appears four times, "intensely quiet" thrice). The piece teaches a patterned, poetic voice but sacrifices immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Register drifts into elevated, poetic diction ("aching beauty," "wan flag," "star-cloaked elders," "hopeful melancholy") that reads more like authorial voice than the tutor's lived interiority under exile's pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the tutor notices in consistently lyric metaphor regardless of urgency. Psychic distance remains uniformly close-philosophical without modulation. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is ornate and uniform, deploying elevated diction ("theatrical sincerity," "symphony of unheard moments") that never modulates under pressure or reflects a distinct perceptual signature. Filter verbs and abstract constructions dominate interiority ("He understood then," "He knew that to recover"). POV remains stable (single third-person) but psychic distance is consistently remote, narrating the protagonist's actions as performance rather than lived experience. The prose texture reads like allegorical summation rather than a character-particular way of noticing, and the register remains static across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and register is elevated throughout. Diction ("olfactorily sensitive," "tide's thought") is ornamental but consistent; no head-hopping occurs. The prose lacks perceptual signature—Lira's way of noticing does not shift under pressure. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as lyric decoration rather than taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent and appropriately modest for a pilot's procedural focus. Diction ("verdant canopy," "slender wand tipped with a shard of obsidian," "kelp," "emerald fire") occasionally drifts toward elevated register during high-pressure beats (discovery, acceleration) rather than simplifying under stress. Perceptual signature is professional but not deeply character-particular; sensory selection reflects mission focus without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue present. Psychic distance shifts are minimal and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual signature (aerial-inspection background, wind-current focus) clear. Diction remains controlled ("hazy precision," "ghostly vortex") and voice-specific. However, several filter verbs ("She believed," "She sensed," "She felt") dull immediacy in key moments, and the phrase "a faint hum that grew louder" in the resolution weakens urgency. No dialogue to evaluate. Distance and stance remain consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.3)
    A consistent third-person limited voice with elevated diction ("oscillating repose," "unfettered itself") establishes a lyric register. However, the lexicon drifts into abstraction ("continuum," "riot of sky") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature is generic; the synesthetic filter is asserted but not rendered in concrete, idiosyncratic detail. Distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    Focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and abstract ("avalanchingly quiet," "texture of possibility," "tapestry of echoes") in ways that drift from embodied perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (canyon hush, gilded surfaces, quiet vibration) but the syntax is rhythmically uniform, with many sentences opening on subject-verb stems. No dialogue appears. The voice reads coherent but lacks the grounded immediacy that would distinguish high-stress beats from reflective ones.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cryptic," "lucid turbulence," "transposed function") but occasionally drifts into academic register ("theorem," "cipher," "numerical patterns") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Mara's perceptual signature—filtering the world through letterpress and borrowed voices—is asserted but not enacted in selective, biased noticing. Sentence rhythms are controlled, though several adjacent lines open with "She" or "The," creating minor template cadence. No dialogue appears; interior monologue remains abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—jittery, task-focused, attuned to vibration and glow—is consistent but generic. Diction drifts into elevated register ("cathedral," "mythic wonder," "testament") that reads above the courier's embodied voice. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains uniform without intentional modulation. The prose carries a faint template cadence with repeated "he [verb]" stems and stock metaphors (sunrise-kissed leaves, night flowers).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and perceptual signature filters detail through Liora's mystic lens ("chant of truth wrapped in paradox," "silent memory of the prism"). However, diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with embodied urgency—phrases like "commune through thought, letting the prism's emotions mingle with her own, a quiet negotiation of feeling" read as abstraction rather than immediate perception. Syntactic patterns recur (noun–verb–prepositional phrase) across multiple beats, flattening rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("air clung to a hush," "stoically sparkling") that remains internally consistent. However, diction drifts into unearned poeticism under low pressure: "raveling silence," "loom of absence," and "latent sacrifice" are repeated as thematic markers without altering Mara's perceptual signature or constraining her choices. Psychic distance is uniform—no modulation as stakes rise—and the prose does not compress or sharpen in the climactic beats (bead placement, thread rising).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance drifts into elevated lyricism ("each strike a promise he could not yet name," "his mind a twin horizon of hope and doubt") that does not reflect the meek blacksmith's interiority. Register is high-literary throughout, with no modulation for urgency or stress. The villagers' dialogue in the penultimate beat ("He spoke of bartered awakenings...") is indirect summary, not dramatized speech. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator's noticing (glittering fruit, humming silk, azure notes) could belong to any observer.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.9)
    Narrative distance is stable first-person, but diction is uniformly elevated and abstract ("cartographic ribbons," "knot where the withheld truth was knotted") without modulation under pressure. Lira's professional lexicon (sensory mapper) never infiltrates syntax or perception—she narrates like a lyric poet regardless of urgency. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's "cyclically spontaneous yet eternally purposeful" reads as authorial summary rather than character-specific thought, and the piece does not teach a pattern that would license such uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV is maintained cleanly, and psychic distance is stable. The prose carries a consistent lyric texture ("luminescent ache," "chorus of unseen letters"), but diction drifts into over-elevated register at peak moments ("collective memory of those who dared to care"). Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("he imagined," "he knew that") dull immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but lacks perceptual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but voice lacks perceptual signature: Mira's centuries of experience never shape her diction or noticing. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the herald's laughter is told, not shown in rhythm or word choice. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("phosphorescent pulse," "living serpent of light") that does not anchor in Mira's specific mind, and the final paragraph's "strange, joyous melancholy" reads as narrator commentary rather than filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.4)
    Voice is uniformly elevated and ornamental, independent of Lira's stated watchfulness or dye-master expertise; register never modulates with pressure. Psychic distance is unstable: the piece claims Lira's interiority but narrates like an external tour guide ("She believed," "She sensed," "She understood"). Diction is generic high-fantasy ("soft amber mist," "thin sun trails," "ribbons of light") with no perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("feeling," "letting") and abstract nominalizations ("iridescent caution," "quietly explosive insight") dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.1)
    Perceptual signature is generic: "rattling wind," "modest glow," "faint tug of memory" could belong to any introspective narrator. Register drifts into elevated diction—"vaulted ceiling," "sigh of the earth," "the world itself approved"—without motivation in a maintenance worker's lexicon. Purposeful elision is absent; every step is narrated with equal ceremonial weight. The phrase "quantified sorrow" recurs six times in identical form, flattening voice under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited with stable distance, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic: "breathing cathedral," "ribbons of light," "grand mosaic of hope" could apply to many fantasy settings. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("bound release of centuries of restraint") that reads unmotivated by the established voice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose lacks a character-particular filter—Lira's way of noticing does not reflect her "scattered memory" trait.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with patterned syntax ("a place of silence hidden in plain sight," "staying while leaving") and elevated diction appropriate to the fairy-tale atmosphere. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. However, the prose often slips into abstract narration—"he felt the pull of those nested paradoxes like a tide"—that tells emotional state rather than anchoring in perception. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he sensed," "he realized") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (one exchange with the curator) and functional but not revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries a single lyric register—elevated, abstract, rhythmically consistent—that does not modulate with urgency or interiority. No perceptual signature distinguishes the protagonist's way of noticing; diction like "heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution," and "uncloak itself like a shy guest" reads as authorial ornamentation rather than character-bound thought. Psychic distance remains fixed at summary-reflective throughout, with no shift into embodied immediacy during pivotal gestures. The voice is coherent but generic, lacking the idiosyncratic syntax or lexicon that would anchor it to a singular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("quartz hush," "filament of story," "map guiding her through the abyss of silence") but borders on uniform lyricism that does not modulate sharply under pressure peaks. Perceptual signature is auditory-focused (frequencies, hum, whisper) and remains character-appropriate for an archivist. However, key moments rely on abstract constructions ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") rather than embodied perception, and the prose does not compress or shift rhythm when the slide activates—the climactic beat matches the texture of earlier description.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lila; psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature—salt, ferment, the watch fob's warmth—colors the narration. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("a metronome for the night to count down," "the comforting unease of waves lapping") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The minimal dialogue (Lila's whispered plea) carries no subtext or goal beyond thematic echo. Purposeful repetition of "truce of hush," "false starts," and "comforting unease" creates pattern, but the voice does not modulate sharply under peak stress (the scout's lunge).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-textural idiom ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "soft binary code") that matches the futuristic-nostalgic tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—elevated diction ("emergent compass," "planetary mood") feels uniform across the narrative rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("felt a faint awe," "realized") are acceptable but not voice-driven, and the final paragraph's explanatory clarity ("he realized...") shifts toward helpful narrator mode, slightly flattening the ending's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction carries a lyric register ("charcoal-fingered," "auroral sorrow") that fits the piece's textural aim. However, the elevated metaphoric density ("light braided with sorrow," "knot of suppressed ideas loosening into a river") clusters thickly in peak beats without variation, flattening urgency. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is consistent but generic—Lena's artist lens is asserted more than demonstrated through selective, biased noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated diction ("bruised, toxic sky," "gilded-leaf," "breathing misty sighs") and stable third-limited POV throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, and the piece avoids head-hopping. However, the register is uniformly lyric-descriptive without modulation under pressure—discovery beats carry the same cadence as reflection beats. Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific (she notices beauty and metaphor equally whether assembling a map or stepping through a doorway). No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in the final third (multiple moves compressed into single lines) fits the accumulative design but lacks the syntactic variety that would elevate rhythm control.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature—selective attention to light, motion, and silence. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("harmonious bell tuner," "tempered vigor," "perpetual dance of metal and ice") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Filter verbs ("feeling," "watches," "knows") stack in emotional beats without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation, and the prose reads more like narrated observation than the tuner's lived interior texture. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping. Diction attempts a lyric register ("throbbed with heat," "mosaic of molten sky") but repeatedly drifts into abstraction ("nostalgic android," "fragmented wholeness," "perpetual vigilance"). Perceptual signature is generic; Vira's way of noticing doesn't feel android-particular or nostalgia-inflected. No dialogue. The prose has texture but lacks a distinct mind; it reads more like authorial observation than Vira's lived interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with consistent past tense. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("narrative pulse," "healing ripple," "invisible threads that bound the community") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices in catalog mode (coats, mugs, blossoms) without bias or selective attention tied to her thrift-curator lens. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyrical register. Perceptual signature is present—"the ink a luminous algae," "each pirouette encrypted a fragment"—but diction remains elevated and uniform across all beats, including moments of supposed pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose maintains a single cadence throughout; no modulation under stress, no interior contradiction, just continuous ornamental assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. However, the diction drifts into abstract elevated phrasing ("gleaming silence," "translucent walls," "filament of light") without embodied anchoring in Mara's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt the tug," "believed," "understood") stack in key beats, dulling immediacy. No purposeful psychic distance shifts; the voice reads as atmospheric narration rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narration is tonally uniform—elevated, distant, and generic. Diction ("nocturnal haven," "terrestrially cosmic," "incandescent glow") reads as thesaurus-driven rather than voice-particular. No perceptual signature or bias; the summoner notices everything with equal poetic weight. The prose lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("patiently nimble grace," "conspiratorial") that suits the mysterious tone but occasionally drifts into purple territory ("fleeting hymn," "stitch the night's fleeting light into the brick's silent grammar"). POV remains stable first-person without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-specific—the observations tend toward poetic universality rather than revealing this particular narrator's biases and blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance, and the perceptual signature remains uniform—poetic, elevated diction throughout. However, voice texture is generic lyric rather than character-particular; Lira's "charmed skeptic" stance does not alter lexicon or noticing patterns. Register remains high-literary without modulation under pressure. The prose reads as one continuous authorial voice describing a figure rather than inhabiting a distinct consciousness; no embodied micro-perception or bias filters the garden or seashell through Lira's specific history or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is weak: diction ("quietly shining resolve," "wisely enduring calm," "crystal-clear vow") recycles elevated abstractions rather than character-specific noticing. Register occasionally drifts into ceremonial summary ("The script narrated a calibrated treason of ancient scribes") that feels imposed rather than filtered through Liora's urgent thought. No dialogue appears. Sentence openings show some variety, but "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems recur across paragraphs without rhythmic motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice is consistent but generic, relying on stock lyric formulas: "quiet ache," "gentle as a reed's sigh," "tender, reed-blown melancholy" recur without character-specific texture. The narrator has stable access (single POV, no head-hopping) but perceptual signature is absent—the protagonist's "richly perceptive" trait does not shape what she notices or omits. Diction drifts into elevated register ("petrichor," "lattice of luminous threads") that feels writerly rather than grounded in the focalizer's idiom. No dialogue appears; interiority is told in abstract emotional labels rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register—"borrowed starlight," "weave truth carefully," "moon-lit water"—that maintains atmospheric coherence. However, the voice leans toward elevated generic mysticism rather than character-particular perception; phrases like "a choir of quiet light" and "the veil thicken" read interchangeable across fantasy narrators. Under peak pressure (whispering into the crystal, entering the dream) the syntax does not compress or shift rhythm, missing an opportunity to embody urgency. Filter verbs ("felt the veil," "felt the cold melt") are acceptable when voice-motivated, but here they dull immediacy in key beats without serving a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice is consistent but highly elevated and ornamental, relying on poeticisms ("scintillatingly somber rhythm," "demure audacity") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. The philosopher's perceptual signature is generic: he "felt," "understood," "sensed" without distinct idiom or embodied bias. Distance remains stable, but the prose reads as authorial rather than filtered through a net-mender's working mind. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited focalization through Mira's perspective without head-hopping. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register that clashes with immediate scene pressure: "the exhilaration of having turned myth into measurable reality," "the world held its breath." Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Mira's way of noticing reads as interchangeable descriptive narration. No dialogue appears. The prose texture lacks rhythmic variation or compression under stress, maintaining uniform sentence structures and a measured, explanatory tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic and elevated throughout without character-specific idiom. Diction ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy," "variant allegiance") repeatedly drifts into prompt vocabulary that no character would naturally use, especially in peak beats. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under pressure. The prose reads as committee voice—ornate but interchangeable—rather than a singular perspective. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("lonesome splendor," "luminous ribbons," "fragile gold"). Yet the voice feels generic-literary rather than character-particular; the poet's perceptual signature does not sharply distinguish him. Figurative density is high but uniform across beats, and elevated diction ("gleaned redemption," "positively wistful") occasionally drifts from the vagrant's plausible lexicon without ironic framing. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance, but diction drifts into elevated lyricism ("fleshly ethereal glow," "azure-coat," "limbs stretched and retreated") that feels ornamental rather than character-specific. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—she notices beauty and resonance but lacks idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("feeling," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated. The prose is legible but lacks distinct texture; vocabulary and rhythm remain uniform across calm and climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and elevated throughout, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or character-specific texture. Diction remains uniformly lyric ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful," "patient sentinels") even under the supposed pressure of the ending beat, with no modulation for urgency. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as averaged consensus rather than Elara's singular perspective, and no dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's perceptual signature prioritizes investigative detail (temperature, humidity, symbols). Register remains consistent, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories," "collective gratitude") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice is competent but lacks the rhythmic modulation or idiosyncratic syntax that would distinguish it as singular; it reads more as functional clarity than as memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited from the chaplain's POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction often drifts into elevated religious register ("whispered confessions," "stone-cold corridors," "metronome guiding him toward a new ministry") that reads generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he recognized," "he wondered") stack in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The shopkeeper's brief dialogue is functional but generic. Perceptual signature is weak—his noticing patterns do not reveal occupational or personal bias. The prose modulates little under the repair's supposed tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric-technical diction ("steadily curious," "transliterate the chaotic patterns," "sarcastic philosophers debating motion") carries a consistent register of whimsical precision. The joke to the gears and Mara's laugh anchor POV personality. However, the narrator occasionally drifts toward exposition ("She had spent throughout the evolution…" reads awkwardly compressed) and the algorithm's "yearning core" personification blurs whose interiority is being tracked. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lia throughout. Diction leans toward elevated register ("vaulted archives," "distant choir," "sublayer," "checksum") that reads more as atmospheric description than character-particular perception. The narrative voice is consistent but generic; Lia's way of noticing does not carry a distinct perceptual signature or bias. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored. Psychic distance holds without leakage, but the prose reads like averaged exposition rather than Lia's interior texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance remains stable in third-person limited, and no head-hopping occurs. Perceptual signature is generic; diction ("shadow-laced," "quiet call," "tentative green") could belong to any fantasy narrator. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "understood") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in high-pressure beats. Psychic distance flattens rather than modulating with emotional intensity, and the prose lacks character-specific rhythm or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature that foregrounds textures (amber light, brine scent, cold metal) and metaphoric patterning (wind as lullaby, ice as breath). Psychic distance holds stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fold in patience," "windborne solace") that reads decorative rather than voice-specific under pressure. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of travel, reflection interleaved with sensory anchors) is taught early and mostly legible, though peak moments trade immediacy for lyricism without always sharpening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable single third-person, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic elevated literary register rather than character-specific; diction ("passionate subtlety," "gently persuasive," "intersubjective understanding") repeats across beats in therapy-speak and academic register, not rooted in a vineyard worker's idiom. Register drift into philosophic abstraction throughout the piece lowers the score. No dialogue present to evaluate. Sentence stems recycle: "By drawing parallels…" appears three times, "gently persuasive" twice, creating template cadence that dulls voice specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited on the Keeper, with a poetic register that remains consistent. Diction is elevated and hypnotic ("whisperfield calm," "soft sea of grain") but uniform across emotional beats; stress does not degrade perception or compress syntax. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Free indirect style is clean, though several filter verbs ("he felt," "he sensed," "he understood") dull immediacy in peak moments. The perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific; any sage could notice these details in this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register ("earnest whimsy") and a stable third-person limited POV focused on Mara. However, perceptual signature is generic: Mara's way of noticing (scanning walls, arranging images, feeling the collective pulse) could belong to any earnest archivist. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line, one answer to a child) and serviceable. The prose carries texture through word choice ("whispered secrets," "dove gray," "violet stems") but does not modulate under pressure; the same elevated diction persists from setup to ending without rhythm shift. No POV leakage occurs, but the voice lacks the specificity and pressure-responsive variation required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective shards," "testify through the crystal") that sits uneasily with the "reticent scholar" frame. Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices light and echoes but her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("seemed to answer," "seemed to bless") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("precognitively forgetful," "translucent monolith," "reverberation will guide him") and extended metaphors that maintain consistency. Perceptual signature is filtered through the prophet's quest and his experience of forgetting-as-arriving. However, the register occasionally drifts toward abstract poeticism ("a tide of longing rose within him, pulling his thoughts outward like a moonlit wave") that flattens immediacy under what should be peak moments. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the final paragraphs sustain voice without rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic elevated-literary rather than character-specific (the sage sees "silvered arches," "radiant sigh," "bittersweet glow" in repeated poetic register). Diction stays consistently formal without modulation under the physical task's pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds steady, but the vocabulary ("ephemeral pulse," "immutable rhythm") reads as authorial overlay rather than the repairer's working idiom, creating mild register drift that persists across peak beats without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchored in Mara remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled. However, the prose defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("decisively kind grace," "coalesce," "everlasting hymn") that reads as narrator commentary rather than Mara's lived perception under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "imagined") stack in high-pressure moments (vinyl placement, final chord) without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. The narrative voice is generic rather than character-particular; Mara's perceptual signature is indistinct from the authorial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("budding rune scholar," "forgotten libraries," "translucent doorway") that fits the fantasy setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("entities that traveled through sealed awakenings") and the prose recycles sentence stems: "She realized that," "She believed that," "She whispered," "She pressed." The key's "faint tick" and the observatory's "hum" return purposefully. Psychic distance remains controlled, though interiority relies on summary ("she longed," "she understood") rather than immediate perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Mara's noticing (bone-setting hands, mapping errors) is generic rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("tapestry of theories," "embryonic galaxy," "nostalgic innovation") that exceeds plausible focalization for a bone-setter in crisis, especially during the repair beat. Sentence openings vary somewhat, but voice lacks distinct texture; it reads as narrator assistance rather than character-bound perception. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("zephyr bloom of syllables," "luminous chords") that abstracts rather than grounds perception. The star watcher's perceptual signature is generic mysticism rather than character-particular noticing, and there is no dialogue to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans heavily on abstract constructions—"protected vulnerability," "honeyed hush," "verdant hush"—that float above concrete perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "seemed") cluster in emotional beats without voice-motivated purpose. The prose texture is lyric but uniform; urgency does not modulate syntax or rhythm. Dialogue is absent (no penalty applied). Perceptual signature is weak—Lira's way of noticing is generic observer rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice is generic and abstract ("feeling the air pulse like a held breath," "quiet that felt like the echo of a breath held too long"). Diction is elevated and uniform, lacking a character-specific perceptual signature—the novelist's professional eye and conflicted stance do not shape what is noticed or how it is filtered. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as vague lyricism rather than taught pattern; key images ("lucidly watchful," "ephemeral cameo") repeat without evolving function.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable throughout, filtered through Mara's reverent perspective. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction ("whimsical tinkerer," "luminous instant," "verdant arbor") suits the fairy-tale frame. However, under peak pressure (the harvest moon's arrival, the vine's unfurling), the narrator maintains identical syntactic rhythm and lofty tone rather than modulating with urgency, and the focalization stays external enough that Mara's perceptual signature (what she notices, how she interprets) never sharpens into character-specific bias or habit.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("moving stillness," "pulse of a heart," "cartography of love and loss"), maintaining a coherent texture. However, perceptual signature is generic poetic register rather than character-specific; the alchemist's way of noticing does not reveal selective bias or occupational idiom. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("moving stillness" appears multiple times) suggest lyric intent, but the pattern is not clearly taught early or paid off with cost at closure—repetition feels decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("the lull of a wounded season," "peripherally aware") that establishes a coherent narrative distance. However, diction drifts into essay-like abstraction during peak beats ("the paradox of capturing something as fleeting as an echo without imprisoning its source") and recycles syntactic stems ("He realized that," "He felt," "He recorded") across adjacent paragraphs, flattening rhythmic variety. POV remains stable with no head-hopping, but the voice lacks a perceptual signature distinct from generic lyric narration.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature (weaver noticing fractal geometry, mineral veins, the lamp's glow) is consistent. However, the narrative certainty exceeds what the focalizer can dramatize—phrases like "the boundary-lessly trapped currents of grief" and "a whalebone reverie of stillness" read as authorial assertion rather than the weaver's embodied perception. Diction inflates into elevated register ("shingled hush folded into itself, compressing the air into a crystal") that obscures immediate clarity. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("hauntingly practical," "measured negotiation between memory and material"). However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions read generically lyric rather than filtered through a lion tamer's widow's particular way of noticing. Repeated syntactic templates ("She set," "She coaxed," "She placed," "She lifted," "She paused," "She lifted again") flatten rhythm at key beats. No dialogue appears. The voice sustains tone but does not modulate under pressure or reveal distinct internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice remains stable in psychic distance and maintains a lyric register, but diction frequently drifts into elevated abstractions ("chronologically confused," "fractured stillness," "eroded ambitions") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("She heard," "She felt") stack in high-pressure beats without variation. The ghost's dialogue ("Give me a chance…") and Mara's whisper feel thesis-adjacent rather than goal-driven subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, but the narrative voice oscillates between technical register ("voltage flow," "life-support bays," "communication array") and elevated lyric diction ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions," "ethical currents," "elegant curve") without consistent character grounding. The intern's perceptual signature is generic rather than distinct—phrases like "each hallway a vector of unfinished plans" and "the weight of a distant star" could belong to any contemplative narrator. Psychic distance wavers: close access to her engineering mind alternates with distant philosophical summary. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific; the scribe's way of noticing (petrichor, glacial hush) could belong to any meditative figure. Lexicon drifts between literary register ("excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush") and straightforward narration without a unifying voice texture. Heavy reliance on abstract modifiers and recycled phrases ("excruciatingly gentle" appears six times, "glacial hush" thrice) flattens rhythmic control and reads as template cadence rather than purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains stable third-person limited and avoids mid-paragraph head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies," "thoughtfully clear") that clashes with urgent action beats, and perceptual signature remains generic rather than character-specific. Purposeful compression is attempted through ellipsis and lyric phrasing, but the pattern is not taught early enough to anchor reader expectation, and elision does not impose cost or create friction paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct textural signature ("breath held by the sea," "pale spine"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, the prose converges on a single register of elevated metaphor throughout, and the protagonist's perceptual signature does not modulate under pressure—calm observation persists identically across all beats. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and employs a measured, elevated register throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into abstract poeticism ("intimate method that coaxed the shadows to whisper their stories") and summary phrasing that distances the reader from immediate perception. No dialogue is present to judge. Focalization is stable, but the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; the prose reads as authorial lyricism rather than a traveler's embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and stable third-person limited POV throughout. Diction is ornate but coherent ("titanic, glassy fingers," "quaking reverie"), and no head-hopping occurs. However, the voice becomes generic under pressure, relying on stock lyricism ("living sunrise," "banner of newfound hope") rather than character-specific perception. Filter verbs ("he sensed," "he realized," "he felt") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. The perceptual signature remains uniform rather than revealing the prince's particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Mira notices with cinematic sweep rather than occupational or temperamental bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("unyielding compassion like a lantern," "quilted with moving clouds") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose unfolds in uniform declarative paragraphs without taught pattern. Filter verbs ("felt," "letting") appear but do not obscure immediacy. The voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic signature beyond the steady accumulation of clause-heavy sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, and the prose carries a distinct lyric-archaic texture ("sidereal patience," "petrichor," "defiant hush"). However, diction occasionally overreaches ("realistically imaginative spirit," "litany of lives yearning") without anchoring in Mara's concrete perception, and perceptual signature is weak—her way of noticing feels interchangeable with narrative decoration. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The register is consistent but lacks the specificities that would make this Mara's lens rather than the author's.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narrative distance is stable (third limited), and diction is elevated and consistent. However, the prose lacks a character-specific perceptual signature; the narrator's way of noticing reads generic-lyric rather than filtered through the sentimentalist's priorities. Purposeful compression and patterned elision (lyric mode) are present, but the piece does not teach its pattern early enough to earn full waiver. Filter verbs ("feeling," "realized") appear without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Eliam, with distance controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is present in diction ("fiercely meditative river," "thundering calm"), but these phrases recur as labels rather than shifting under pressure. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("collective grief," "spectral mentorship") that reads more authorial than character-particular. The family dinner poems are told in summary ("Eliam would recite a poem about winter stone, and his sister would offer one about sunrise lilies") without on-page dialogue to test voice distinction. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance is consistent, but the texture does not degrade or sharpen with emotional intensity—it remains uniformly ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, and diction maintains elevated register throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: Mara notices in catalogue fashion (ridge, tower, pendulum, inscriptions) without character-specific bias. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure; the same lyric cadence persists in ascent, ritual, and resolution. No POV leakage, but voice lacks specificity—any meditatively inclined protagonist could inhabit this register.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with a consistent perceptual filter (the gardener's tender, ritualistic attention). Diction is elevated and textured ("velveteen gloom," "errant note," "quiet applause") and maintains coherence. However, register drift into poetic abstraction ("uncharted echoes," "the shape of intentions") occasionally clouds immediacy, and the gardener's internal voice does not degrade or shift under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled but emotional modulation is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.9)
    Narrative distance remains stable (third limited), but voice is generic and elevated without character-specific texture. Diction drifts into corporate register ("predictive modeling," "scenarios that could be simulated," "blueprint") unmotivated by the cartographer's medieval-fantasy context. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is absent; the narrator catalogs events without selective, biased noticing. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV anchored in Mara's perception, with no head-hopping. However, the perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "thistled calm," "secretly luminous," and "dust swirled upward" could belong to any lyric narrator rather than a diligent copyist's specific way of noticing. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("slipped through the static via elusive song lyrics") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. Distance control is stable but lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited voice maintains stable distance and offers some atmospheric texture ("shattered porcelain shards, each fragment catching the dim light like broken hopes"). However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgent action ("a somber marvel at her own resilience"), and many lines are more lyric decoration than character-specific perception. No dialogue on the page. Perceptual signature is generic rather than biased by her occupation or motive. The voice serves mood over clarity and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single first-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct academic-philosophical texture ("wannabe philosopher," "rationally rebellious") that remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("agonize," "abrasive calm," "chorus of truths") that feels imposed rather than organic to someone living in a sewer. Psychic distance is controlled, and filter verbs are minimal. The prose reads as a singular perspective, though the lecturing tone flattens under peak moments where embodied urgency would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the teacher, and the perceptual signature is consistent (poetic, elevated diction). However, psychic distance is too far for a 600-800 word piece; we never access her specific fears or contradictory impulses, only abstract mood ("expectantly resigned," "quiet thrill"). Diction is uniform and elevated throughout—no modulation under pressure, no syntactic compression during the performance. The rosette "glowed brighter…as if the wood itself approved" shifts into light omniscience, asserting sentience outside the teacher's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance oscillates between close sensory immersion ("flavors of childhood, loss, and hope swirled on her tongue") and distant poetic declaration ("the gentle rebellion was not a war of fire"). Register drifts into elevated metaphor ("starlight bent the mind itself," "synaptic pathways of the plants' own nervous filaments") that exceeds Mara's plausible interiority. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; filtering through "tasting memories" never yields character-specific bias or selective attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and Mara's perceptual signature emphasizes atmosphere and visual detail. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("candid toll keeper," "nectar dusk," "taste the silence") that reads more poetic than character-specific under pressure. The prose at the climax—"the glyphs rearranged themselves, spelling the answer"—externalizes discovery rather than filtering it through Mara's mind. No dialogue appears; interiority is sparse and declarative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction disconnected from the narrator's stated role ("sanctify," "inadvertently profound," "hushed blaze"). Perceptual signature is generic aesthetic appreciation rather than character-specific noticing. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose texture feels more committee-poetic than individually grounded, especially in peak beats where specificity would anchor the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV maintains stable distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("incisively kind clarity," "primordial foundation") that fits the mythic setting. However, diction becomes ornamental rather than character-particular—phrases like "animate lifeless paradox" and "sapphire pools" read as authorial decoration rather than filtered through the statue's telepathic consciousness. Perceptual signature is generic; the statue's way of noticing does not reveal a distinct mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and no head-hopping occurs, but perceptual signature is generic—phrases like "a silent promise," "a whisper of kinetic potential," and "a quiet anthem" could describe any philosophical quest. Diction drifts into elevated register ("rupture the confines," "lattice of probability," "algorithmic") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The prose carries a consistent rhythm but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would distinguish Aric's mind under pressure. Filter verbs ("He knew," "He realized," "He felt") appear frequently, dulling immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Mara; psychic distance is stable. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("saffron quiet," "moon-tipped," "hymn of reconciliation") that suits the contemplative premise. However, perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing reads uniform across beats without character-specific bias. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but do not crowd. Brief convergence when Jiro's interiority is accessed ("felt the brush's whisper… found himself remembering") without clear section break, a minor POV leak that does not obscure the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV with elevated diction ("honeyed sorrow," "ribbons of water") remains consistent but operates at one psychic distance throughout, never modulating with pressure. Liora's perceptual signature is generic curator-voice; no idiosyncratic noticing or bias shapes what she registers. No dialogue appears, so no voice distinction to assess. The prose is competent but rhythmically uniform, with many sentences opening on subject-verb and running to similar clause length, creating a steady lilt that does not accelerate or breathe with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstracted register inconsistent with visceral urgency ("bleak exhilaration," "latent radiance," "mournful rhythm"). Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") stack in key beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to judge. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks purposeful modulation under pressure; the voice reads uniformly literary throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but lacks perceptual signature; Mara's way of noticing reads generically gothic rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated diction ("slithering susurrus," "nauseating aurora," "viscous syrup") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Mara's consciousness under stress. The advisor's dialogue ("To trick fear…") is expository and unnaturally articulate. Psychic distance is inconsistent—some sentences inhabit Mara's body ("feeling its cold weight seep into her veins") while others observe from outside ("the air taste of copper and rot").

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person distant narration maintains stable stance and avoids head-hopping. Register drifts into ornate diction ("sketched resonance," "syncopated applause") that exceeds the scene's immediate texture without clear voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic—any observer could notice the same details in the same order. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression is attempted but the elliptical style (no explanation of how clouds become melodies) obscures causality rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, lyric texture: "molten ribbon," "amber dread," "sea-green glow." Perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic, pattern-focused). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("reverence," "silent watchers perched...like statues...awaiting judgment") that reads generic rather than Mira-specific. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to stir," "seemed to") and phrases like "quiet resolve" flatten immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; narrative distance is controlled. The piece earns mid-6s for texture but misses higher bands due to stock phrasing and slight register drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter is consistent (academic, measured). However, the register drifts into elevated diction disconnected from scene pressure: "emotionally rational heart," "transparent honesty," "the world beyond the ivy seemed to inhale a new clarity." These phrases read as authorial assertion rather than Arlen's lived perception. The prose carries a uniform, deliberate rhythm that flattens rather than modulates under emotional stakes. No dialogue is present to judge naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narration maintains consistent third-person limited POV with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering is stable. However, the prose leans heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("stoically sensitive," "archeologist of abandoned dreams," "hushed blaze") that reads as imposed rather than character-organic. Rhythm is controlled but repetitive: many sentences follow the pattern of noun + verb + poetic modifier. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She believed," "She imagined") appear frequently, dulling immediacy. The voice reads more like atmospheric exposition than a distinct mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable. However, the prose voice is generic literary rather than character-particular: "mournful sigh," "tangible foundation," "quiet proof" read as committee diction, not Mara's perceptual signature. Psychic distance is mid-close but uniform; no modulation under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("sacrificial flood," "lattice cipher") without clear motivation from the focalizer's expertise. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction, however, drifts into elevated abstraction ("coaxing the ether closer to his fingertips," "folded fragment of his sorrow turned into hope") that does not feel character-rooted. Perceptual signature is generic; the lantern maker's way of noticing lacks specificity. Sentence openings vary, but rhythm flattens under the weight of declarative metaphor rather than modulating with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("bruised violet," "intangibly tangible," "perturbation theory") that matches the science-fictional setting but occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("intangibly tangible" appears three times without clarification). Perceptual signature is present—instruments hum, the visor projects probabilities—but the narrator's way of noticing feels more like catalog than character-specific bias. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final turn to "fierce, exhilarating clarity" reads more like narrative assertion than filtered experience.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira, though her perceptual signature is generic—"sharp-eyed" is told, not shown through biased noticing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("articulate the word belonging without uttering a syllable," "veil of brilliant dimness") that clashes with the pilot's presumed practical idiom. Sentence stems repeat: "The [noun] [verb]" opener appears in six consecutive paragraphs mid-text, creating template cadence (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice convergence). The pilgrim's dialogue-free murmurs and smiles flatten potential voice distinction. Psychic distance wavers when narration claims the chip "was rumored to be the key" without anchoring who rumored it or when Lira learned this.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent and employs purposeful compression ("sieved hush," "tide of tempered regret"), but diction throughout is elevated and abstract, often clashing with the immediacy of the journey and discovery. The opening sentence stacks three metaphors without clear coherence ("slab of sky-blue stone...last sigh of sunlight...compass to my own sins"), and filter verbs ("seemed," "appeared") recur in moments that demand directness. Psychic distance is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—sensory selection does not reflect the genealogist's professional or personal priorities in a character-specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable single-third, but perceptual signature is absent—diction lacks character-particular texture, reading instead as elevated literary register ("phantom from the sea mist," "furrowed hush") uniform across all beats. Psychic distance is consistent but generic. The negotiator's professional lens (what does a prisoner-exchange negotiator notice first?) never filters description. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("saying that the pull inside represented a shared turning point") without subtext or character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-philosophical register with purposeful compression in places ("sunrise painted the sea with trembling gold," "water shimmered like liquid glass"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstract prompt-language ("align heart and action," "backlash of regrets") that reads as theme-scaffolding rather than the navigator's situated perception. Free indirect style is stable but the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—observations read interchangeable across any reflective protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and a poetic register throughout, with purposeful diction ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder softened"). No head-hopping or POV leakage occurs. However, the prose often elevates into abstract philosophizing ("weaving new threads into the tapestry of humanity") that stretches the focalizer's plausible lexicon under stress. The perceptual signature is present but not character-particular—observations read as authorial rather than filtered through a specific past. Psychic distance remains stable, and the lyric mode is taught early, so no experimental penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice relies heavily on stock fantasy diction: "silvered mist," "luminous grove," "moon-woven mist," "impossible glow." Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]," "The [noun], [adjective], [verb]." Free indirect style is inconsistent—psychic distance shifts without purpose, oscillating between close observation and distant omniscience. The perceptual signature lacks character specificity; Liora's way of noticing could belong to any fantasy protagonist. Dialogue is absent, so no speech-pattern testing is available.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and generates distinct lyric texture ("onyx-ink," "nebula cloak"), but the perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific. Diction elevates uniformly—no modulation under pressure, no compression at crisis. The cartomancer's interiority leans on synonym loops: "choking beauty" recurs unchanged, "willingly perplexed" is told rather than shown through selective noticing. Purposeful compression is attempted (elliptical time, imagistic leaps) but the pattern is not taught early enough to charge the ending; instead it flattens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds without head-hopping, and diction remains elevated throughout ("ghostly resolve," "mournful fireflies," "luminous garden"). However, register is uniform and abstract across calm and crisis beats—no rhythmic shift marks the dimension's opening. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt," "she whispered") stack without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic; Nara's way of noticing does not reflect pacifist training or personal history, only poetic catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice is consistent and elevated, with purposeful lyric diction ("smoldering amber," "captive constellations"), but the register is uniform across beats regardless of pressure. Mara's perceptual signature—everything read as orchestrated sign—remains static and generic. The fisherman converges into the same interpretive idiom ("his soul recognized the same secret rhythm"), erasing voice distinction. No dialogue appears, so subtext and goal-driven speech are not testable.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping, and diction remains elevated throughout ("luminous," "phosphorescent," "subtle key"). However, the prose converges on a single ornate register regardless of pressure—Kael's perceptual signature is indistinguishable from narratorial commentary, and his interior voice lacks character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("he had heard," "his curiosity turned") dull immediacy in several beats. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—Selene's way of noticing (aurora, salt, ancient fire, mist) could belong to any lyrical observer and carries no character-particular bias or occupational filter from an "eel herder." Diction drifts into elevated register ("precognitively cursed," "sacred patterns," "harmonic of the sea") that sits uneasily with the ostensible folk role and is never grounded in her idiom or profession. The prose shows purposeful compression and lyric patterning, but the pattern does not tighten or shift cadence under pressure; instead, it sustains a single meditative tone from opening to close without modulation for escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person POV stable; no head-hopping. Diction elevated and consistent ("rarefy," "cartography," "storm-kissed wonder") but borders on decorative when density exceeds beat pressure. Perceptual signature relies on stock poetic phrasing: "ink on parchment," "electric scent of ozone," "luminous ink." Distance modulates purposefully through the storm sequence. Register drift into abstract philosophical idiom ("terrain to be traversed with reverence") in peak beats (−0.3). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("destinations of focus," "compass of thought," "paragraph in a story of reason and rhythm") that sits outside any character's perceptual signature. The philosopher and diplomat lack distinct interior voices; both are described in parallel poetic register. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression or patterned elision is attempted but not taught early; the prose oscillates between summary and ornament without a legible pattern paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is nominally third-person limited to Lira but frequently drifts into omniscient summary ("Word of the luminous fracture spread beyond the prison walls"). Diction toggles between lyric elevation ("trembling candle against night") and flat exposition ("arranged books by theme rather than code") without voice-motivated reason. Lira and Rook speak in identical register: both produce perfectly articulated thematic statements. No perceptual signature distinguishes the focalizer's way of noticing. The single line of dialogue ("What rebellion hides in a cup?") carries no subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elevated, poeticized register is consistent but uniform across all beats—no modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic lyric ("taste of steel and longing") rather than character-specific. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("feeling its weight like a heart") and abstract summaries ("reshaping the tide") pad the text. Psychic distance is stable but lacks immediacy or embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (empirically whimsical, cataloging dreams as weather charts) establishes a distinct filter. Diction is controlled and elevated ("translucent realm," "luminous doubt"), appropriate to the voice and world. However, under the pressure of the climactic translation, the prose does not modulate or compress—syntax remains lyric and even-paced throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The phrase "a balance she vowed to keep as the seed's story unfolded" at closure reads as future-facing summary rather than present-tense embodied perception, a minor distance slip.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and lyrically controlled with purposeful patterned repetition ("rhythmically placid," "tides of remembrance"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak moments ("weave a second knot at the point where the wind's sigh meets the stone's cold") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted, and the tutor's perceptual signature is not distinct from the narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Mara's strategic resolve. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., in the puzzle-solving rhythm, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, but minor overwriting in phrases like "forgotten throat" slightly tempers control. Diction remains character-consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, blending scientific diction with lyrical observation in a way that feels coherent for a neutron star researcher in a ruined greenhouse. Patterns like “quiet laboratory,” “preprocess reality,” and the repeated attention to tiny gradients give the prose a recognizable perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains appropriately intimate. A few lines veer toward essayistic abstraction, but overall the voice feels controlled and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a clear preference for sensory, light-focused description that matches Elya’s craft. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction is stable. That said, the narrative sounds more like an elevated authorial lyricism than a strongly individuated interior voice, and repeated signature phrases slightly flatten its distinctiveness. Overall it’s polished and publication-ready at many venues, but not yet singular in texture for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear sensory palette and recurring image systems (breath, glass, tide, heat). Diction generally matches the contemplative, post-catastrophe mood and Mara’s introspective stance. There’s some risk of generic “literary” register—certain phrases could appear in many similar pieces—but the specific inventions (heat-mapping emotions as tones, winterglass) keep it from feeling anonymous. POV remains stable and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses undertaker imagery and maritime/architectural metaphors (“arches bending like ribs,” “patient sigh” of the sea). Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, and POV remains stable in Marlow without head-hopping. The voice modulates gently—more incantatory as the lens activates—without losing clarity. At times the lyricism approaches uniform solemnity, but it suits the subject and does not fracture the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and well-suited to a quiet, communal tale, with recurring rhythmic phrases (“amplified quiet,” “gentle pressure of responsibility”) that bind the piece. Distance is mostly close to Mara without head-hopping, and the lyric tendencies are legible and pattern-taught. At times diction tilts toward abstract or repetitive (“quiet knowledge,” “gentle,” “promise”) rather than sharply particular to Mara’s mind. Strong, but not yet singular or surprising enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tuned to Milo’s sensibility, with a rich, sensuous lexicon that supports the mystical tone. The narrative distance is stable; we never slip into an external commentator or another POV. Rhythm varies reasonably well across the piece, with longer, incantatory sentences in contemplative moments and a mild tightening around key breaths and transformations. Occasional near-purple turns don’t quite undermine control but do brush the edge of overindulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically steady and clearly anchored in Mara’s sensibility, with a confident, poetic register that suits the speculative-lyric mode. Diction is controlled and thematically aligned (“hyperbolic geometry,” “Möbius strip of foliage,” “texture of time”), and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance remains consistent from opening to closure. The main limitation is that the uniform rhapsodic tone sometimes smooths over opportunities for sharper emotional contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with controlled rhythm and a distinct sensibility that notices ruins, mechanisms, and organic life with equal intensity. The diction is elevated but feels unified with the fable-like tone and world rather than arbitrarily ornate. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance remains stable while allowing occasional reflective turns that stay anchored in present stimuli (music, inscription, seeds). At times the lyricism could afford a bit more roughness or fragmentation under peak pressure, but it never breaks plausibility for this stylized mode.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s synesthetic sensibility, giving the narration a distinct texture. Diction and rhythm are well controlled, and the accumulative pattern of images (colors-as-sounds, absences as fodder) is clearly taught and sustained. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The main limitation is a certain sameness of register and cadence over the whole piece, with little modulation for moments that could bear sharper edges.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a recognizable texture of light-based imagery and elevated diction. POV is stable and legible, though it sometimes slides toward omniscient commentary rather than staying tightly bound to Lira’s perceptions. Rhythm and phrasing are controlled enough that the lyricism feels intentional rather than random. There is little dialogue, but what’s present is simple and inoffensive, functioning as a cue for the flower-code rather than character-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and distinctly lyrical, with a consistent metaphor palette of glass, thaw, and breath. The rhythmic, liturgical repetition of Mara’s narrated tasks both defines her and provides tonal spine. At times the elevated register skirts uniformity—nearly every sentence aspires to image—but it remains legible and thematically coherent. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the slight omniscient tilt suits the allegorical mood.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a consistent blend of stunt-world concreteness and mythic diction. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the internal lexicon (“stunt‑trained eye,” specific mapping of moves to symbols) roots the lyricism in character. There’s some mild register drift toward lofty abstraction in climactic lines, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the perceptual signature feels distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinctive texture of sea, stone, and mystical attentiveness. Phrasing like “summarizing silence,” “ambered hush,” and “river of stars” creates a recognizable idiom that fits the oracle’s worldview. At times, the diction tips toward uniform high lyricism, which flattens modulation and can feel slightly over-saturated, especially with repeated constructions. Still, POV control is clean, and the rhythmic prose generally supports rather than obscures the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, mildly elevated lyric texture that suits “mundane mysticism.” Diction is stable and mostly plausible for a narrative focalized through a robot with poetic perception. There is some sameness of register (“amalgamate,” “resonance,” “loops”) that makes the voice feel more like an essayistic narrator than a fully individuated consciousness. Nevertheless, POV control is clean and the rhythm is generally well managed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and textured, with a clear aesthetic of quiet, luminous observation that matches Mara’s role and the story’s mood. Diction like “resonant hush,” “ambiguously clear,” and “eavesdrop through ink” creates a distinct perceptual signature without major register slips or POV leakage. At times the abstraction level rises enough to blur immediacy, but overall the voice is controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and clear focalization through the vine dresser’s perceptions and beliefs. Recurrent phrasing (“blooming withering,” measurable luck, the garden whispering) reads as intentional patterning rather than artifact, and the cadence generally suits a mythic, contemplative mode. There is some risk of sameness in rhythm and diction across sentences, but not enough to blur POV or cause confusion. The garden’s brief “voice” is folded smoothly into the existing texture without jarring shifts in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear preference for paradox and sensory-metaphoric phrasing (“violin bow on frozen strings,” “cold fire”). Focalization stays tight to Lira without head-hopping, and the narrative stance maintains a consistent, gently elevated register that suits the piece’s speculative-poetic aims. At times the diction trends toward homogenously ornate, which slightly blurs Lira’s individuality as a perceiver versus a generic poetic narrator. Even so, rhythm and imagery are controlled enough that the voice feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with Mara’s perceptions shaping diction and metaphor. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively between hushed description and slightly heightened peak beats. There is no POV slippage or intrusive exposition; the narrator’s certainty stays within what Mara can plausibly infer. The voice is distinct and confident without overreaching into mannered preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a confident, image-rich register that matches the speculative, introspective mode. Mirela’s perceptions (treating data as pulse, heater hiss as song, margins as sites of transformation) provide a recognizable perceptual signature, even if her diction occasionally blends with a more generic lyric-narrative voice. Psychic distance remains stable; there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. The voice is strong and controlled, though it falls slightly short of the utterly distinctive, unforgettable texture seen in top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—lush, industrial-gothic, with recurring motifs (“drowsy alertness,” “ghost shift”) that feel intentional rather than accidental. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a reflective, slightly heightened literary mode, and the focalization stays cleanly with Mara’s perceptions and interpretations. At times the register skews toward ornate abstraction, slightly distancing emotional immediacy. Still, the voice is controlled, recognizable, and tonally cohesive across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative material, with a consistent perceptual lens focused on texture and atmosphere. Diction is elevated but coherent with a timeless, mythic register and doesn’t slip into incongruous jargon. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrator’s distance remains steady without unmotivated shifts. While distinctive, the voice could gain even more personality through sharper idiosyncrasy in how the keeper notices and interprets his world.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and suits the contemplative, ritual frame. Diction is generally controlled, though certain phrases (“ordinary magic,” “cautious exuberance,” “softly adaptive”) feel repeated as labels rather than evolving in nuance. There’s a pleasant rhythmic flow, but the perceptual signature is more generically poetic than distinctly Liora-specific. No POV slippage or register shocks undermine the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly keyed to this particular mind—attuned to stone, ash, and quiet vibrations. Recurrent phrases (“bronze quiet,” walls that speak) operate as deliberate motifs rather than tics, building a distinct cadence. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; the narration’s certainty feels compatible with the quasi-mystical frame. At times the voice smooths over potential sharpness in emotional texture, but its control and coherence remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently omniscient, with consistent diction around secrets, light, and encoding. It suits the fable-like, accumulative mode and avoids head-hopping. At times, the register becomes generically elevated and abstract, which blurs the character’s specific perceptual signature and flattens emotional immediacy. Still, the narrative stance is coherent and the rhythm mostly supports the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct texture rooted in ritual, sound, and color; diction and rhythm feel deliberate and patterned rather than generic. POV distance is stable and appropriate for the quasi-mythic tone, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing edges toward grandiose abstraction, but it generally serves the chosen register and does not break the voice’s integrity. The lack of dialogue is a valid stylistic choice for this homiletic, visionary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct taste for reflective, musical metaphors that fit Lian’s artistic obsession. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly suited to a meditative, visionary moment; psychic distance is stable and appropriate. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the pattern of heightened language is taught early and maintained. At times the register nears uniform rhapsody, which slightly reduces modulation under peak moments but doesn’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent register of paradoxical imagery (“towers fell upward like inverted roots,” “darkening brightness”) that fits the speculative introspection. POV is stable and the narrative stance doesn’t leak or wobble; the pattern of ornate, metaphysical description is taught early and maintained. Rhythm is generally controlled, though the density of similar constructions and repeated key phrases makes the texture feel slightly homogenous by the end. Overall, the voice is distinctive and coherent, if somewhat over-saturated.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the tactile, vibration-centered world, with a clear bias toward sonic-metaphoric imagery filtered through a deaf perspective. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the focalization stays cleanly with Marin’s experience. At times, the diction drifts into generalized abstraction (“inner apathy,” “emotional numbness dissolve like frost”) that feels less character-specific and more authorial. Still, the overall perceptual signature—feeling sound as pressure and glow—is distinctive and well-maintained through the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and slightly formal, well-matched to a meticulous archivist and to the accumulative, atmospheric mode. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some pleasing images (“vines like whispered secrets,” “sky bruised violet”). At times the voice leans on generic-poetic abstractions and repeated phrases (“layered tranquility,” “truth would always find a way”), which feel more authorial than character-particular. Still, there is a distinct perceptual signature centered on storms, patterns, and subtle shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a lush, slightly archaic diction that suits Arlen’s occupation and the reliquary-like greenhouse. POV control is clean; we remain inside Arlen’s perceptual frame, and the narrative confidence matches what he can plausibly infer from scents and images. Rhythm and syntax are varied, and the prose modulates from descriptive to more interiorly charged as the perfume takes effect. Occasionally the narrative slides into essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break the voice or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical cadence and a clear preference for metaphor and rhythmic repetition that matches the mystical premise. The perceptual signature—seeing time, energy beings, and stone as verse and tapestry—is coherent, and POV distance doesn’t wobble or head-hop. At times, diction veers toward generalized “poetic” language rather than a sharply individual sensibility, which blunts memorability. Still, control is good, and the voice carries the piece without mechanical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and sound-conscious in a way that suits an acoustically attuned protagonist, with nice rhythmic control (“soft as a seed sprouting in ash”). POV distance is consistent; we remain close to her perceptions without head-hopping. The main weakness is a drift into generalized, aphoristic register in later lines that feels more authorial than character-inflected. Overall, the voice is distinctive and confident but not fully disciplined at the thematic peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward scent and texture befitting the premise. Diction such as “affectionate detachment,” “half truths of the grotto—half memory, half myth,” and “node of potential buyers craving the counterfeit comforts” creates a distinct, recognizable narrative texture. The psychic distance stays stable and apt; we are close enough to feel Mara’s methods without sliding into expository explanation. At times the register is uniformly elevated, but it suits the piece’s literary-lyric ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently omniscient, and consistently lyrical, with a clear fondness for maritime and bibliophilic imagery. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly apt for a quiet fable-like tone, and the repetition of certain phrases (“cautious exuberance,” “cycles of compassion”) contributes to a patterned texture. At times, the narration drifts toward generalized sermon rather than closely focalized perception, which slightly flattens distinctiveness. Still, the voice feels intentional and coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyric third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—sensory-rich, metaphor-forward, and attuned to communal emotion more than individual psychology. Diction (“luminescent ache,” “graft herself onto community”) is elevated but coherent with the mythic-ritual frame, and the narrative distance remains stable. Cadence modulates appropriately, slowing for ritual and softening at closure. While the voice is more narrator-inflected than tightly character-bound, it suits the accumulative, fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and well-suited to the lyric, mythic mode, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly within a plausible narrative register for this kind of fable-like telling. Psychic distance remains stable, and the patterned references to cadence and heartbeat feel intentional rather than accidental repetition. At times the narration abstracts into summary insight (“She understood that…”), which slightly blunts immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and well-matched to the material, with a distinct preference for mathematical and organic metaphors. Psychic distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic tone, and the patterned syntax (e.g., “each step a coefficient of gentle invention”) reinforces the thematic frame. Occasionally the explanatory lines flatten the lyricism, but overall the voice feels polished and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrical and consistent, with a clear preference for sensuous, almost incantatory diction (“sapphire hush,” “collective yearning”). It maintains stable focalization on Maren without head-hopping, and the narrative distance is controlled. That said, the voice is more generically “elevated poetic” than uniquely character-specific, and the rhythm can feel uniform. It’s polished enough for serious consideration but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a noticeable scientific-lyric hybrid lexicon (“microclimate,” “data point,” “equation” alongside “whisper of wind,” “quiet surrender”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narration’s confidence matches what Marlowe could plausibly infer. Some phrases lean into generic lyricism or abstraction (“storm’s promise,” “world would reshape itself in patient, circuitous loops”), which occasionally blur his individual perceptual signature. Still, point of view control is clean and stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a textured, slightly lyrical register that matches Mara’s sensibility as an artist. Diction choices like “thresh meaning,” “haggard awe,” and “barren cliffs” give the narration a distinct feel without sliding into academic or clinical language. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between external description and interior significance without confusion. At times the voice leans on similar cadences and abstractions, but not enough to seriously blunt its effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the cave’s mystical ambience, with recurring phrases (“bright darkness,” “unseen forces”) creating a deliberate incantatory pattern. POV distance is mostly steady—hovering just outside Lira while occasionally sliding into her realizations—without jarring head-hops. Some diction leans generic-mystical (“everyday magic,” “chorus of wonder”) rather than sharply character-specific, but syntax and rhythm are generally controlled and musical. The absence of dialogue sidesteps some opportunities for sharper, individuated voices but keeps the tone unified.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled, with a clear, consistent sensibility oriented around sound, water, and archival metaphor. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent and believable for a mythic, distanced narrator rather than a conversational POV. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, tidal sentences and tighter moments around key actions like sounding the valve. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions, though the distance keeps us slightly outside the archivist’s most intimate thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and a distinct fascination with pattern, light, and mapping. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly apt for the contemplative, uncanny tone. There are no POV slips or gratuitous explanatory intrusions. The main limitation is a tendency toward uniformly elevated, decorative phrasing that slightly flattens modulation across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly fused with Lira’s sensibility, maintaining consistent distance and diction. Syntax and rhythm vary pleasingly, and the narrative stance—half-analytical, half-poetic—fits a “sympathetic skeptic” who dwells in both logic and wonder. There are a few higher-register abstractions that feel more like authorial voice than Lira’s immediate perceptions, but they don’t break POV integrity. Overall, the piece has a distinct, recognizable narrative texture without slipping into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent lyric register and a distinct fondness for magnetic and prismatic imagery that gives the piece a recognizable texture. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay tethered to the immortal’s perceptions without head-hopping. At times the elevated diction plus repeated phrase structures make the voice feel slightly uniform and over-sculpted, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and comfortably handles lyric abstraction (“liquefy rigid thinking,” “breach in perception”) without losing basic clarity. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with a recognizable texture that suits the quasi-mystical tone. At times, the register leans toward generalized conceptuality, which slightly distances us from Mara’s embodied experience, but it remains internally consistent rather than drifting arbitrarily. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance is stable and apt for the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct: lush, metaphor-rich, and controlled, with a consistent sensibility that marries observation and quiet wonder. Third-person focus on the stationer’s perceptions is stable; there’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the diction (“incandescent restraint,” “invented histories,” “textures of different times”) feels of a piece. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony even with a high density of figurative language. While the lyric register occasionally edges toward uniformity of tone, it remains purposeful and character-inflected rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly shaped by the narrator’s in-between legal status and sensory fixation on surfaces and filters. Diction (“palimpsest,” “corrugated,” “museum of vanished moments”) fits a reflective, slightly heightened register but remains plausible for this consciousness. The point of view never drifts; what he claims to know he can plausibly perceive. Rhythm is mostly controlled, with enough variation in sentence length to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyric third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with patterned metaphors and rhythms that suit the mythic, reflective mode. POV is clean and stable around Selene, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the elevated diction and repeated constructions (“ephemeral compass,” “resonant hums”) verge on sameness and self-consciousness, but they remain legible and purposeful. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong, if occasionally overinsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits the fantastical setting. Diction is generally aligned with the semi-mythic tone of a “perpetual carnival” and doesn’t drift into distracting registers. While not radically idiosyncratic, the prose has a recognizable rhythm and pattern of noticing (lights, tides, banners, maps) that feels tied to the world and to Mira’s pattern-seeing mind. There are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a contemplative lunar archivist, with a measured, lyrical cadence that fits the mood. Technical details (chemical reactions, camera rigging, lunar geography) are embedded smoothly into that voice without feeling like exposition dumps. The diction remains coherent and elevated without slipping into anachronistic jargon or register mismatches. It stops just shy of truly distinctive, idiosyncratic voice at the level that would stand out immediately in a top-tier magazine slush pile.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and well-suited to a sensory-rich, contemplative mode; diction like “magnetic calm” and attention to sound and vibration create a distinct perceptual signature. POV modesty is respected: the narration stays within what Mara could reasonably infer, given her blindness and experience. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose flowing, with a clear modulation into slightly more elevated cadence at the ending. The lyricism is polished but occasionally leans toward uniformity of tone, with few sharper or more ragged inflections under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person, close-in voice is consistent and confidently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature in its fondness for cartographic and aqueous metaphors. Diction and syntax generally feel appropriate to a reflective, solitary intellectual in a harsh landscape, with nice rhythmic turns (“the glass became a portal to the frozen depth”). At times the language edges toward purple—dense figurative stacking in successive sentences—but clarity survives and the pattern remains controlled. POV boundaries hold cleanly, and the narrator’s distance and certainty match what Mara could plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to the quasi-mythic mode; phrases like “wild hush” and “ghost town revival in the making” establish a distinct texture. Psychic distance is consistent—close enough to feel aligned with the tuner’s intentions, yet distant enough to maintain fable-like remove. There are some repetitive constructions and abstract nouns (“shared balance,” “patient patience”) that slightly flatten individual voice. Still, the cadence is controlled and largely avoids confusion or register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and a recognizable pattern of imagery around scent, light, and memory. Diction occasionally feels more like an external narrator’s aesthetic (e.g., “lonesome splendor”) than Mara’s interior idiom, but the distance remains legible rather than confusing. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from becoming sing-song. Overall, the point of view is controlled, if a bit homogenous in emotional coloration.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with distinctive phrases like “copperlight repose” and a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the fable-like premise. POV is stable and doesn’t head-hop; the narrative distance remains close enough to his perceptions while allowing some mythic framing. Occasionally, diction strains toward preciousness or abstraction (“knowing his motivation was to thread a labyrinth with your own story”), slightly breaking the spell. Still, the voice feels intentional and largely under control.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends the ghost’s sensibility and the orchard’s alchemical mood. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and patterned phrases like “mournful elation” feel like deliberate leitmotifs rather than accidents. The distance stays stable and omniscient without head-hopping, though the lush register sometimes smooths over potential moments of sharper, more character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, confident, and distinctive, with a clear preference for image-rich, rhythmic sentences. Diction like “orchid solace,” “hauntingly optimistic lullaby,” and “luminous canopy” establishes a recognizable register that matches the fable-like mode. There is some tonal sameness—nearly every sentence leans lush and reverent—which can blunt modulation but doesn’t break control. POV distance and access remain stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mara’s sensibility, favoring organic and ritualistic imagery that matches the subject. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the piece from becoming monotonous, and the diction is coherent for this mythic-fantastical register. There are no POV slips or jarring register shifts. At times the lyricism becomes slightly uniform in tone, blunting moments that might benefit from sharper or more varied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent and confident, with a clear textural palette of images (neon, code, chalk, futures-that-never-arrived) and no POV slippage. Rhythm and diction mostly feel controlled rather than generic, and the tone modulates gently as the ritual progresses toward departure. At times, the language drifts into familiar lyric turns (“the world seemed to hold its breath”), which slightly flattens the otherwise distinct voice. Still, the perceptual signature is coherent and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a recognizable cadence and controlled imagery that suits a contemplative, mystical frame. POV distance hovers between close and lightly omniscient but doesn’t slip confusingly, and there’s no head-hopping. Diction (e.g., “adjacent possibilities,” “echoed silence”) sometimes edges analytical, yet it feels like part of this story’s particular aesthetic rather than stray register drift. Overall, the perceptual signature—seeing thought and conspiracy as threads and patterns—is distinctive and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a clear preference for incantatory rhythms and recurring phrases (“fierce tenderness,” “moment before deciding”). Diction is controlled and mostly well-suited to the mystical frame, avoiding jarring register shifts. Psychic distance stays steady—close enough to register her inner state without collapsing into analytical commentary. Some patterned repetition feels slightly over-insistent, but overall the voice feels unified and distinctive rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical register and no POV leakage. Diction like “lotus-hearted ache” and “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is distinctive and suits the quasi-mystical tone, even if it occasionally feels more authorially ornate than character-filtered. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to sustain the meditative pace. There is little dialogue, but the interior and descriptive voice carry the narrative clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the dreamlike atmosphere, with some memorable phrasings (“photon-kissed pigment,” “knowledge network… ripple like a friendly pulse”). POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the narration maintains a unified sensibility. However, diction sometimes leans into generic-poetic registers and repeated formulations (“pensive mirth,” “luminous hope”) that soften its distinctiveness. Strong but not yet singular or razor-sharp for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, sensuous, and clearly colored by Lena’s identity as a mural restorer; perception is strongly visual and textural, which feels character-specific. Rhythm and diction maintain a unified, slightly elevated lyric tone that fits the magical setting. There are no POV slips or unjustified omniscience, and the modulation from wonder to a calmer, contemplative exit reads smoothly. A touch more variation in rhythm or texture at turning points could heighten contrast, but control remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear taste for conceptual, slightly surreal phrasing (“tax collector of thoughts,” “converging chaos into a single, luminous thread”). It maintains a stable psychic distance, mostly hovering near Lysander while allowing a gentle slide toward Mirabel at the end without true head-hopping. The diction and rhythm are distinct and intentional, even if sometimes more essayistic than character-bound. Absence of dialogue keeps us in a single register, but that register feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture built from neologistic phrases and aquatic-cosmic imagery. Rhythm and diction mostly feel intentional and controlled, teaching a pattern early and sustaining it through closure. There are no POV slips or register jolts; the narration maintains a unified sensibility aligned with the poet’s contemplative stance. Its main weakness is a tendency toward uniform lushness, which slightly flattens modulation under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“foxglove regret,” “pale light seeped through opal panes,” “deserted marvels”) and controlled, incantatory rhythm. POV distance is stable and appropriate to the fable-like frame; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the diction sometimes tilts toward self-conscious ornamentation, with repeated constructions and a narrow emotional palette of wistful solemnity. Strong and memorable, but the intensity of the register occasionally risks homogeneity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suited to a lyric, ritual-like piece, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and a controlled elevated diction. Musical and covenantal metaphors create a recognizable texture. Some phrases drift toward familiar fantasy-poetic formula (“dust and forgotten promises,” “secret garden,” repeated “symphony”/“chord”) which softens the distinctiveness of the voice at a prestige-lit level.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture (“ash…aligning like the notes of an ancient score,” “living ledger of feelings”). Diction and imagery are coherent with the story’s mythic-technical atmosphere, and the slight omniscient tilt suits the fable-like tone. There’s no head-hopping, and shifts in intensity (e.g., during the valve turn) are handled smoothly. At times the elevated register risks uniformity, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Lila’s contemplative focus on maps, birds, and dust; the perceptual signature (attentiveness to motion patterns and fragile textures) feels particular rather than generic. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with a clear preference for long, flowing sentences that suit the mythic-quiet tone. At times, similar constructions and echoing phrases risk a touch of sameness across the piece, but not enough to break immersion or blur POV distance. Overall, the voice feels polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature focused on distances, echoes, and textures. Syntax and rhythm vary in a controlled way and support the meditative, fable-like tone. There is a mild mismatch between the child’s presumed age and the highly abstract diction, but the piece reads as mythic rather than strictly realist, which partly justifies it. POV control is clean with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses astral and oceanic imagery and sustains a cohesive tone. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with a mythic/meditative mode, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the voice verges on homogenous lushness (“softly ingenious,” “luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”), which flattens modulation and can blur emphasis. Still, control is solid and the POV never becomes confusing or mechanically expository.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic-fantastical material, with consistent diction around color, tides, and glass. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how the narrator fuses emotion to optics and sound (“cheerful gloom,” “violet sigh,” “amber glow that spread like sunrise”). Some phrasing and concepts recur a bit too neatly, giving moments a slightly patterned feel rather than the pressure-responsive modulation of top-tier work. Still, POV control is clean and the voice feels unified and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic tone, with recurring phrases like “calculated wilderness” and “orchestrated serendipity” giving it a clear texture. POV distance is consistent and limited to the performer’s perceptions and beliefs, with no head-hopping. At times, abstraction (“a beacon,” “a tiny compass pointing toward unexpected harmony”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but it fits the chosen register. Overall, the narrative voice is controlled, distinctive, and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and tied to Lira’s sensibility, with recurring diction (“obsidian grace,” “spilled ink,” “whispered promise”) forming a recognizable texture. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re close enough to feel her ritual but never slip into omniscient commentary or POV confusion. The rhythm modulates well between meditative explanation and heightened, incantatory beats during the inscription. It’s a distinct, well-controlled voice, though not quite at the level of formally daring or risk-taking that would push it into the 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person focalization through Mira is steady, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled imagery and a clear preference for visual perception. Diction is elevated but largely consistent with the contemplative, quasi-mystical frame and doesn’t suffer from register whiplash. At times, the voice drifts toward abstraction and repetition (“noctilucent,” “read between lines,” “clear complexity”), which slightly blunts its impact. Overall, the POV and voice are coherent, but they don’t yet reach the precision and modulation of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is stable and largely consistent in its elevated, lyrical register. There is a pleasant rhythmic control in many sentences, and patterns (moon, ash, light, “hard softness”) are repeated deliberately enough to feel like a chosen texture. Still, the voice often reads as generalized “literary lyric” rather than distinctly Maren’s perception, with diction that could plausibly narrate many different protagonists. No head-hopping or POV slippage issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to the fable-like, speculative atmosphere, with a consistent lexicon (“lucidly watchful,” “kaleidoscope of potential,” “serene upheaval”). The perceptual stance aligns with a logical dreamer’s blend of abstraction and image, and there is no head-hopping or POV confusion. At times, the diction trends toward uniform loftiness and abstraction, which flattens moment-to-moment modulation of intensity. Still, the voice feels intentional and coherent, and it sustains a recognizable texture across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the meditative premise; it maintains consistent psychic distance around Lira. Sentence rhythms and diction (“dream hum,” “symphony of stone,” “living tapestry”) give the piece a recognizable texture without losing clarity. At times, the register edges toward generic-poetic phrasing rather than something idiosyncratically Lira, which slightly flattens distinctiveness. Still, POV control and narrative stance are clean and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, with a stable third-person distance and a clear preference for musical, image-rich syntax that suits the mirage-painter premise. Diction and rhythm hold together; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the prose sometimes slides into a homogeneous, gently elevated register, with repeated phrasings (“dusky harmony,” “borrowed heartbeat”) that dull distinctiveness rather than deepening it. It’s controlled and fluent but not yet at a singular, unmistakable register.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and comfortably inhabits Lira’s perspective, with consistent elevated diction. Recurrent phrasings—“operatively gentle,” “price of redemption,” “flawed beauty”—create a recognizable texture but also risk feeling programmatic. There is no head-hopping, and shifts in intensity (e.g., when she begins to read, when swords are placed down) are well supported by rhythm and word choice. The high, almost ceremonial register works for the piece’s aims but occasionally feels homogenously grand, reducing contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyrical voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to the quasi-mystical ritual, with clean control of distance and no head-hopping. Diction and imagery create a distinct texture (“sound like a thousand whispered wings,” “broken glass that somehow felt whole”) and stay internally consistent. That said, the voice feels more like a polished literary-narrator than something sharply idiosyncratic to this specific man’s mind. It’s strong and publishable but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a recognizable preference for synesthetic, ornate phrasing that suits the fable-like tone. POV distance is steady, and the narration doesn’t slip or over-explain; it maintains a confident, slightly elevated register throughout. Some phrasing and imagery recur in similar patterns (“between sigh and smile,” multiple “threads”) in ways that border on self-parody, and the density of ornament occasionally blurs emotional specificity. Still, the voice is distinct and coherent enough for strong mid-high placement.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture built from repeated motifs (meteor hush, half-lit light, reversal). Diction is elevated but stable, matching the contemplative, almost essayistic register of an “urbane calligrapher.” There is no dialogue to test, but focalization stays with Selene’s perceptions and conceptual frames. At times the narration slides toward authorial essay rather than clearly embodied interiority, yet the stance remains coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries the esoteric and the concrete. Recurrent phrasing like “blushing stillness” and “interrupted cadence” creates a deliberate musicality that fits the accumulative design. At times the diction leans toward redundancy and lushness, but it generally remains legible and purposeful. POV is stable and close enough to Lira to feel character-linked without slipping.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and distinct, with a clear perceptual signature focused on craft and sensory nuance. Diction is occasionally awkward or self-conscious (“technically gentle,” repeated “snowmelt ardor”), but the overall stance remains stable and legible. No POV slippage or explanatory intrusions disrupt the experience; the voice carries the piece’s mythic, ritualistic feel effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyrical texture and a clear perceptual bias toward the mystical and symbolic. Diction (“ethereal grit,” “sentient filament,” “precisely playful humming”) feels unified and intentional, and the psychic distance remains stable. At times the register drifts toward generalized mysticism that could fit many similar stories, slightly diluting the individuality of the voice. Still, control of rhythm and focalization is strong and clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently elevated, lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic-historical frame; diction and rhythm are controlled. The perceptual filter aligns with Nabu’s vocation, focusing on ledgers, constellations, and numerical order in a way that feels character-appropriate. Repeated phrases (“empirically ironic,” “dusky harmony”) border on incantatory rather than careless, but they do risk a hint of sameness. POV is stable and modest in scope, with no intrusive omniscience or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person narration has a consistent, gently lyrical register that suits the quasi-mystical tone and stays stable across both shards. Diction (“shifting grace,” “cellular memory,” “living tapestry”) is controlled and mostly character-appropriate for a quasi-mythic vantage, with only occasional drift toward explanatory abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, particularly Mara’s whisper to Kovan, which folds theme and action together. The voice could be sharpened by slightly more idiosyncratic perception tied to Mara herself, but it’s already polished and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice has a clear, consistent texture, favoring crystalline, reflective imagery that suits a mirror maker moving through fog and frost. Diction and syntax remain stable and controlled, with a recognizable perceptual bias toward light, glass, and breath; this gives the piece a distinct sonic and imagistic identity. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” tone. At times the elevated register risks sameness, but it stays coherent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and lyrically inclined, with a consistent lexicon that fits the quasi-fantastical setting and Lira’s reflective nature. The narrative stance stays within her perceptual frame without head-hopping, and the rhythm is generally well-controlled. Some diction (“accidental wisdom,” “deciduous vows,” “feisty resolve”) repeats and begins to feel like a posed thesis rather than organically arising thought. Still, the voice is distinct and recognizable, and it carries the scene smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct texture in phrases like “simply complicated” and “pond of starlight.” Diction fits the surreal, philosophical mode and holds steady without jarring register shifts. The narrative distance stays stable; we’re close enough to feel his mental state but not so close that the voice loses its slightly elevated, curatorial tone. Some sentences verge on ornate, yet overall the voice feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically textured, with recurring sonic and botanical motifs shaping the narrative stance. Diction is elevated but coherent with the fantastical setting and Selene’s scholarly role, and the slight omniscient tilt (especially around the time traveler) never breaks clarity. There is little modulation of distance to delve more deeply into Selene’s interior life, which keeps the piece coolly conceptual rather than emotionally intimate. Still, the perceptual signature—books as music, plants as language—is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct texture—lush metaphors, conceptual juxtapositions, and patterned diction around ink, rust, and light. POV distance is steady and appropriate for the fable-like, mythic register; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the abstract, high-register phrasing slightly flattens individual character particularity, but as a narrative voice for this mode it is confident and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly ornate diction that suits a meticulous archivist in a magical clock tower. Phrasing like “fables of absence,” “clear complexity,” and “warmly methodical” gives the prose a distinct texture without drifting into self-consciously academic register. Psychic distance is stable, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience. The voice could risk more modulation under peak moments, but its steadiness supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent attention to resonance, light, and pattern, matching the mapkeeper’s role and the caves’ nature. Phrasing like “dripping silence into the air” and “living auroras” shows controlled inventiveness without major register slips. Psychic distance remains stable; we are close enough to his perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive authorial explanation. Some repeated constructions and favored adjectives (“gently luminous,” “bloom of hush”) create a slight sense of patterning, but it feels intentional rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to a solitary custodian meditating on ruins and ritual. Recurrent phrasings (“thistle-blown hope,” “shard of hush”) feel mostly like intentional motifs rather than artifacts, and the diction is internally consistent. The perceptual signature—attention to light, vibration, and quiet—is distinctive and character-appropriate. At times, the voice edges toward uniform high lyricism even in lower-stakes beats, which slightly flattens modulation, but control remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close/limited voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-suited to the observant, archivist mind; diction and syntax are controlled and consistent. The perceptual signature—attention to light, echo, and pattern—is clear, though not radically idiosyncratic. Modulation with pressure is subtle but present, with calmer, more expansive sentences around reflection and slightly tightened rhythm near the closing insight. No POV leakage or stance confusion appears.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly aligned with the protagonist’s sensibility, with patterned diction (“filter,” “note in mosaic,” “serious playfulness”) woven throughout. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the figurative register feels intentional rather than generic. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; distance stays moderately close while preserving a mythic sheen. The main limitation is that the voice sometimes favors atmospheric repetition over sharpening emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward subtle natural cues (ripples, breeze, owl, glints on stone). Diction is consistent, and the psychic distance stays tight enough that we experience the ritual as she does. There is some sameness in sentence rhythm and repeated structures (“She felt…,” “She noted…”) that limit textural variety. Still, the voice feels unified and appropriate to a meditative, observant chronicler.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lyric texture (“clouds brushed his cheeks like cool silk,” “gilded hush of the heavens”). Diction is elevated but coherent with the fable-like tone and Lio’s sensibility; psychic distance remains stable. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the rhythm modulates reasonably well between movement and contemplation. A few phrases flirt with purple abstraction, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently patterned, with a clear preference for metaphor and sonorous phrasing (“vaulting hush,” “fractured lullabies,” “a sunrise caught in glass”). Focalization stays basically with Lira’s sensibility, and the diction suits an almost-mythic, meditative mode. At times the register slides toward slightly abstract or self-conscious formulations (“fluidly logical mixture,” “catalyze calm”) that feel more authorial than character-bound, but they do not break coherence. Rhythmic variety is adequate, though similar sentence cadences recur often enough to risk monotony in a longer piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close-ish voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lexicon of neon-mythic diction. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the descriptive palette holds together tonally. However, the narrative distance stays mostly at a cool descriptive remove; we seldom feel Mina’s mind modulating the language beyond shared aesthetic. Greater use of free indirect interiority or sharper bias in perception would deepen voice-character integration.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently modulated, with a distinct texture of diction (“loaded quiet,” “tender shadow keeper,” “luminescent veins”). POV distance is consistent and suited to the mythic, ritual tone; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some lines flirt with over-abstraction and piled metaphor, but they don’t break clarity or voice coherence. Overall, the perceptual signature is unified and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is coherent, with a distinct blend of wary pragmatism and lyric, speculative attentiveness (“quantum promise felt different--like a song humming in the fibers of reality itself”). POV boundaries are respected, and the occasional elevated diction feels plausibly like this character’s chosen register rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm is varied and generally supports the sense of wonder, though some sentences stack abstractions (“quantum promise,” “tangible covenant,” “concepts could walk, speak, and bleed”) in ways that slightly blur emotional immediacy. Overall, the voice is strong and memorable, if sometimes more essayistic than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and consistently lyrical, with a clear preference for metaphor and sensory richness. POV stays close to Lian without leakage, and the elevated diction is at least plausible for a scholar protagonist. Rhythm is generally well-managed, though heavily patterned phrases recur enough to feel mannered rather than uniquely character-specific. Dialogue-free narration suits the solitary, meditative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical, with a clear fondness for extended metaphors and recurring motifs (“shivering bliss,” “shape of possibility,” breathing architecture). POV is stable and the diction suits a mythic, dreamlike mode, giving the piece a distinct texture. That said, the register occasionally feels self-consciously ornate (“factually mystical,” repeated high-concept abstractions) in ways that flatten rather than deepen the knight’s specificity. Despite that, the rhythmic control and patterning are strong enough for publication-level polish with revision.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Amelia’s sensibility, with recurring motifs (“unfurling,” dust, silhouettes) establishing a distinct texture. Diction and rhythm suit a contemplative archivist, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the lyric register verges on uniformity—emotional intensity doesn’t sharply modulate the voice—but it remains controlled and legible. The narrator’s perception feels particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, with patterned diction (“auric,” “coded,” “reflected,” “whispering”) that establishes a distinct, almost mythic narrative stance. Psychic distance remains steady; we dip lightly into Mara but mostly ride a controlled, poetic omniscience that suits the fable-like frame. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative rhythm (long, flowing sentences punctuated by firmer cadences near the end) is deliberate and effective. At times the register feels slightly more abstract than Mara’s embodied experience would suggest, yet the overall POV and voice control are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable and confident, with a distinct fondness for synesthetic and textural phrasing (“air was quietly vivid,” “filament of color stretched taut over the silence”). The perceptual signature—attuned to fog, light, and sound—matches the protagonist’s role, even if his personal idiom is not sharply differentiated from the narrator. A few lexical tics and slightly forced terms (“vested hush,” repeated “in mist”) chip at polish, edging toward mannerism. Still, the voice is clear, legible, and suits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong, unified filter: everything is perceived through Lira’s orderly, quasi-religious attention to pattern and ritual. Diction (“ashen skyborne arbor,” “mossy delight,” “arboreal elders”) is controlled and coherent for a mythic-fable register, and POV does not slip. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, though the narration holds a steady, elevated tone without sharp modulation under “stress” (because little stress exists). The absence of dialogue suits the piece’s meditative, solitary focus.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits a reflective, detail-attentive tinkerer. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the descriptive richness feels like a genuine perceptual signature rather than generic “fantasy lushness.” There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the narrative stance maintains a consistent, intimate distance. The voice doesn’t take wild formal risks, but it’s polished and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, with a distinct, measured lyricism that matches a meticulous alchemist. Diction choices like “factually mystical,” “unseen ledger,” and “luminous regret” create a recognizable perceptual signature and stay consistent. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and psychic distance remains steady. The only constraint is a relatively uniform elevated register that rarely modulates into rougher or more fragmented rhythms under emotional strain.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a clear lyrical texture and recurring sonic imagery (“hum,” “vibration,” “echo”) that fits the premise. Diction is generally controlled and suited to the quasi-mythic mode, and psychic distance stays stable. Some phrasing trends toward generic lyricism or repetition, but not to the point of flattening the voice. There’s room for a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature, yet the current execution is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct poetic texture that matches Lira’s altered perception (“world still bruised by light,” “geometry of compassion”). Diction and rhythm feel intentional rather than generic, and the lyric register is maintained without head-hopping. At peak beats, the narrative occasionally slides into abstract exposition instead of letting image carry meaning, but the perceptual signature remains clear. The lack of dialogue is appropriate and never missed.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tied to a character who lives in metaphor and pattern; “between-worlds translator” feels embodied in the diction. There are no POV slips or artificial withholding, and the reflective distance suits the accumulative design. Rhythm and syntax show conscious control, with long, flowing sentences that match the meditative tone. At times the elevated register flirts with uniformity, but it remains coherent and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and colored by Mara’s technical and perceptive habits, giving the prose a clear perceptual signature. Lexicon and imagery (horology, dust patterns, structural cracks) fit both the character and the story’s concerns. Rhythm is varied and confident, with only occasional drift toward ornate phrasing. The voice is strong and publishable, though not quite at the razor-precise, unmistakable level of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with a strong preference for metaphor and conceptual phrasing that suits the surreal premise. Diction and rhythm are largely consistent and controlled, and the accumulative pattern of recurring phrases (whisper, rustling awakenings, perfect systems, negotiable reality) is clearly taught and maintained. There’s some risk of monotone grandeur—little modulation into plainer registers, even at moments that would benefit from sharper, more grounded contrast—but the piece never loses track of its chosen stance. POV distance is steady, if somewhat cool, and avoids disruptive slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well matched to the ornate world and Lira’s poetic disposition. The narrative distance stays consistent, with a controlled drift between close interior and wider communal view, and there is no head-hopping. While the diction sometimes feels more omnisciently lyrical than character-specific, the overall perceptual signature is distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is stable and close enough to Alder to let his artisanal reverence color the narration (“tinkersong wonder,” “lullaby that mirrored the ticking of sunrise”). Diction and rhythm are consistently lyrical without head-hopping or jarring register shifts. While the voice is pleasant and occasionally striking, it does lean on a familiar fantasy-poetic cadence and could use sharper idiosyncrasy to feel truly singular. Still, control and coherence are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-attuned to Mara’s sensibility; diction like “resonant hush,” “liquid glass,” and “star-water” builds a consistent sonic and imagistic fabric. The narrative stance maintains appropriate distance, blending external description with just enough interior tilt to keep us inside her perspective. There are no POV leaks or stance confusions, and the modulation from town to cavern to return is smooth. At times the register edges toward uniformly elevated, but it suits the story’s mythic-lyric ambitions and remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly aligned with an artist’s sensibility, with strong image-making and a stable psychic distance. Repeated turns of phrase and occasional abstract formulations flatten the distinctiveness in places, but there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm is generally controlled, with sentence length modulating appropriately with mood. The voice is solid and publishable but not yet so singularly idiosyncratic or risky as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a lush, incantatory cadence that suits the story’s contemplative mode. Diction like “umbral tenderness,” “phosphorescent rhythm,” and “world’s quiet pulse” establishes a clear stylistic signature, even if it sometimes feels more authorial than character-bound. Psychic distance is mostly consistent, without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. The main limitation is that the voice reads as a generalized lyric register rather than distinctly Mara’s interior music.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with a consistent lexicon that suits a contemplative archivist in a fantastical world. Phrasing like “a code of compassion to decode” and “parley of sand and sky” show controlled patterning rather than random ornament. Psychic distance stays coherent, without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. At times the elevated diction edges toward uniform rapture, which slightly reduces modulation across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent elevated, quasi-mythic diction that suits an alchemical fable. Syntax is mostly smooth, and patterned phrases around memory, light, and revival create a recognizable texture. That said, the voice sometimes drifts toward generic-poetic abstraction, with many similarly cadenced sentences stacking metaphors without much modulation. The lack of sharper shifts in rhythm or distance during key beats keeps the voice from feeling fully singular.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically textured, with diction that matches the quasi-mystical, future-ruin setting. Harel’s perceptual bias—toward language, sound, and ritual—is consistently reflected in sentence construction and imagery. Though dense, the narration maintains clarity and an interior focus without slipping into omniscient explanation. The lack of dialogue suits the contemplative mode and avoids register clashes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct vocabulary and rhythm that match the mythic, contemplative premise. Phrases like “furiously tranquil” and “a garden of perpetual bloom” create a recognizable perceptual signature, and psychic distance remains stable. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narration’s certainty about the magic is appropriate for the mode. While the register is elevated, it feels intentional and coherent rather than randomly inflated.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is steady, mildly elevated, and suits the contemplative, ritualistic tone of the piece. Technical terms (microclimate, sensors, console) blend smoothly with lyrical description, and there’s no POV slippage. The diction is controlled and consistent, though the perceptual signature feels gently generic rather than sharply idiosyncratic. Overall, the voice is solid and publishable but not yet distinctive enough to stand out at the most competitive level.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent elevated diction and cadence appropriate to a contemplative cosmic janitor. POV is stable and modest; there is no head-hopping, and the narrator does not claim knowledge beyond what this quasi-mythic focalization can plausibly frame. Rhythms and sentence structures vary enough to avoid monotony, and recurring phrases (“through the hush,” “flourishing stillness”) read as intentional pattern rather than artifact. A slight tendency toward homogeneous abstraction keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, with a controlled, solemn rhythm fitting the “mute eloquence” tone and single, close-third focalization. Diction (“tangled covenant,” “honey of memory,” “mute eloquence”) coheres with the world’s mythic, post-apocalyptic register. It lacks a sharper edge of idiosyncrasy or tonal modulation under pressure, so while strong and steady, it doesn’t quite reach exceptional distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a consistent diction that suits a mythic-speculative mode. The narrative focuses tightly on Mara’s perceptions without POV leakage or awkward omniscience. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and key images (“present peeled back,” “sky stitched with constellations made of silver sand”) feel authored rather than generic. At times the lyricism smooths over tension, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently elevated, and clearly aligned with the poet’s sensibility, with a recognizable rhythm and diction (“burnished hush,” “woven dawns,” “warmly attentive”). Psychic distance remains consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Yet the lyrical register changes little across beats, flattening intensity; the same lushness applies to discovery, ritual, and closure alike. Recurrent phrasing begins to feel mannered, slightly diluting the distinctiveness of the voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and consistent with a contemplative, quasi-mythic frame. Diction choices like “gently systematic,” “living symposium,” and “chlorophyll clouds” give the narration a distinct texture. There is some mild register drift into abstract or pseudo-technical language (“subtle bio‑energies”) that doesn’t always feel anchored in Mara’s psyche. Overall, though, the point of view is controlled and confident without obvious leakage or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and lyrically inclined, with consistent diction that matches an educated, contemplative protagonist. Phrases like “melodic echo of far-off chemistry” and “bronze quiet resonance” give the narration a distinct texture without obvious head-hopping or register breaks. Rhythm is varied enough to keep the paragraphs from droning, and the accumulative cadence suits the contemplative, almost ritualistic scene. The high lyricism occasionally risks sameness in tone, but it remains controlled and character-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent and clear, with a distinct texture of elevated, image-rich diction that suits the mythic tone. Psychic distance remains stable; we stay near the coachman’s perceptions without head-hopping. Rhythm is generally controlled, though the prose leans on similar cadences and repeated constructions (“narrow vastness,” “promising that…”) that slightly blunt its impact. There’s no dialogue, but the narrative stance itself carries the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly elevated lyric texture that fits a mythic post-apocalyptic fable filtered through a dog’s heightened senses. Diction and imagery (“ears pruning the hush,” “metallic dust that sang”) show a deliberate rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual lens. There’s occasional tension between animal POV and abstract, human-like conceptualization, but the piece leans into fable rather than realism, which mostly justifies it. Overall, the narrative stance is confident and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    The first-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, elevated lyric register that fits the speculative, reflective frame. Phrasing like “river of light that once fed the metropolis” and “vacuum” is texturally distinct, and POV boundaries are clean. However, the lexicon leans generic-cosmic at times (“universe waited with patient arms,” “blank map”), blurring into a more generalized SF-poetic voice rather than something deeply idiosyncratic. Rhythm is mostly smooth despite long sentences, with no serious stance or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident, consistent, and well-matched to the fairy-tale-fantastical material: phrases like “frozen teeth clawing the heavens” and “clouds pulse like living ribbons” carry a distinct texture. Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The register is elevated but coherent, though it rarely modulates out of lushness, which slightly flattens emotional contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntax and a distinct texture (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence,” “half-remembered prayers”). The diction matches the elevated, quasi-mythic frame and doesn’t noticeably violate POV plausibility. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance remains stable throughout. Occasional repeated phrases and high-density metaphor verge on mannered but don’t break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive sensory and metaphorical palette tied to Lira’s perceptions (ink, feathers, stone, thunder). Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the prose flowing, and there are no POV slips or stance confusions. At times the diction edges into uniformly elevated, metaphor-dense territory, which slightly narrows the emotional range and risks sameness of texture. Nonetheless, it reads as a coherent, controlled voice rather than generic “fancy prose.”

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture that fuses chess vocabulary and mystical imagery (“platinum labyrinth,” “woven hush,” “winnow the soul”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly appropriate to a reflective, learned tutor in a fantastical setting. There are some repeated constructions and favored phrases (“fierce repose,” “woven hush”) that slightly blunt the edge of the voice, and the lyricism occasionally edges into uniformity. Overall, it’s a strong, coherent narrative stance but not yet singularly arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, confident, and tonally consistent, with a clear taste for refractive, echo-based metaphors that match the world. Psychic distance stays fairly close to Mara without head-hopping, and the rare dialogue (“The stone remembers,” “Let this echo carry us beyond the mist”) fits the elevated register while remaining simple and childlike where needed. Rhythm is generally well controlled, with longer, incantatory sentences suited to the ritual atmosphere. The diction sometimes trends uniformly high across all moments, which slightly flattens modulation, but not enough to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a clear lyrical texture that suits the fantastical setting (e.g., “the world mends itself in golden seams”). Diction and imagery are consistent, and the narrative stance does not slip or overreach what the focalizer could plausibly perceive in this surreal context. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, though the heavy reliance on similar metaphor families (quilting, seams, tapestry) edges toward sameness. Overall, the POV control is strong and the voice distinct, if occasionally over-insistent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly painterly, with metaphors that feel true to his sensibility (tunnels as brushstrokes, seashell colors tied to his palette). Psychic distance is controlled; we remain close enough to feel his perceptions without head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. Lyric density is consistent and taught early, so the later lushness reads as intentional rather than drift. While the register is elevated, it fits the reflective, solitary artist and doesn’t abruptly slip into incongruous jargon or flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and lyrically inclined, with a consistent diction and rhythm suited to the magical-realist tone. The perceptual signature is focused on vibration, light, scent, and tenderness, which reinforces theme. At times, the register tilts toward purple and repetitive, with similar constructions and motifs resurfacing in ways that feel more ornamental than pressure-driven. Still, there is no head-hopping, and tense and stance remain controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture (“eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps,” “map‑making engine that could translate loss into audible currents”) and no POV leakage. Rhythm and diction are controlled; longer, incantatory sentences suit the accumulative, ritualistic structure. There’s confident modulation toward a quieter cadence at the end without losing the established style. The only ceiling is that the narrator’s sensibility feels more mythic than intimately bound to this particular navigator’s psyche, preserving a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual style (“broken cathedral of fruit,” “fractured grace”) that fits Mara’s rational yet contemplative stance. POV is steady and free of head-hopping, and the register—while elevated—is believable for a reflective, rational narrator. Occasional abstractions (“cultivate psychological safety,” “darker motives”) brush up against essayistic diction, but they don’t break the voice. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support the accumulating, meditative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Marlowe’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control and consistent diction. The narrative comfortably sustains a slightly archaic, poetic register that suits an eccentric lighthouse keeper communing with tide and wind. At times the repetition of phrasing (“softly persistent,” “borrowed memory”) and stacked metaphors approach overrichness, but they don’t break clarity or POV credibility. Overall, the piece has a distinct and recognizable voice that holds through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the fable-like tone and Elian’s contemplative nature. Diction (“empirically intuitive,” “doorway of decisions”) occasionally brushes abstraction but generally remains coherent with the elevated, mythic register. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how the narrative notices maps, routes, and small guiding creatures; no POV slippage or stance confusion appears. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony and supports the accumulative, meditative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close holds stably on the queen, and the lyric-epic register is consistent throughout. Phrasing like “bleeding starlight,” “lacy menace,” and “shadows dancing like silk ribbons stained with dark ink” gives the voice a recognizable texture. At times the diction risks uniform, high-flown abstraction that blurs the queen’s personal sensibility into generic myth-poetry, but it remains legible and controlled. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and suited to the “scientifically romantic” tone, with a coherent diction set around light, heat, and transformation. The narrative distance is stable, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. Rhythm can feel a bit uniform and abstract, favoring conceptual phrases (“density of presence,” “directed spontaneity”) over sharply personal observation. Still, the voice has a recognizable texture and holds together across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    The first-person voice is consistent, with a poetic, self-analytical register that fits a “habit ridden scribe” obsessed with dreams and time. Diction (“feral nostalgia,” “chronologically confused mind,” “time is a cruel editor”) is elevated but coherent with his persona, and the interior monologue keeps a stable psychic distance. The lucid transitions between waking cabin, dream flight, and return are handled cleanly, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the slightly mannered tone reads as intentional rather than as a prose glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct, contemplative texture that matches Lena’s sensory deprivation and compensatory focus on touch, rhythm, and imagery. Diction like “emotional terrain,” “occluded views,” and “conduit for love’s first sigh” feels unified in register and plausibly tied to a reflective, ritualistic craftsperson. There’s effective rhythmic modulation—the prose softens into near-lullaby as the clock syncs and the fog lifts—without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narration edges toward abstract essayism, but not enough to fracture POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, ritualistic scene. Recurrent phrases like “a breath between storms” and “saturated hush” help establish a distinct sonic texture without fully tipping into mannerism. Minor slips—“She held that breath during a held breath” and “She smiled softly brightly”—momentarily mar the polish but don’t break POV or distance control. Overall, the perceptual signature feels specific to Lira and consistent from opening to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical and coherent, with a distinct sensibility that fuses musical, religious, and tabloid imagery into one perspective. Diction and metaphor choices feel consistent with this peculiar exorcist-journalistic hybrid and maintain a stable psychic distance. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates gently as pressure rises toward the orchard’s felling. Occasionally the density of figurative language flirts with overrichness but does not collapse clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the mythic subject matter. Diction (“spiral arbitration,” “a universe’s hiccup,” “resounding hush”) creates a distinct texture and perceptual signature, and the psychic distance stays stable. There is some repetition of key phrases, but it functions as intentional motif rather than scaffolding. The elevated register occasionally flattens emotional immediacy, yet it never breaks POV plausibility for this archetypal figure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical cadence that matches the contemplative tone and never breaks POV. Diction is consistent with a slightly elevated, literary register, and sensory focus (water, light, metal, breath) forms a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling monotonous despite the lyric density. It’s strong and assured, even if not yet idiosyncratic enough to feel utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The first-person voice is stable, observant, and mildly lyrical, with a consistent technical-spiritual register that suits the premise. POV control is clean, and the perceptual filter (noticing spatial warps, networks, light) is coherent. Some phrasing trends toward generic inspirational language, softening distinctiveness at peak thematic moments. The voice is polished and readable but not yet singular enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-matched to a mathematically inclined protagonist; the diction around probability and paradox feels natural rather than grafted on. Sentences have a lyrical, rhythmic flow that supports the contemplative, accumulative drive. There are occasional abstract or slightly overwrought turns (“equations in the language of rain”) but they stay within a coherent stylistic register. With no dialogue, the piece avoids head-hopping and maintains a consistent perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and well-suited to the haunted, underground premise, with textured diction like “forgotten vein” and “symphony of endings learning to begin.” Psychic distance stays stable and there is no head-hopping; the narrative stance feels close to Mara yet gently omniscient in its patterning. Rhythms modulate nicely between lush description and tighter summarizing beats as the chorus of callers accumulates. Occasionally, the register tips into abstract summarizing (“melodically haunted design”) that momentarily distances us from the lived experience, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the archivist’s contemplative, sensory-rich attention, with recurring diction (“steep,” “blooming,” “haunted euphoria”) that creates a distinct texture. Psychic distance is handled smoothly; we hover close to his perceptions without head-hopping or jarring stance shifts. That said, the register sometimes veers toward ornate abstraction, and density of metaphor can blur the mind behind the language. Strong and controlled overall, though slightly constrained by the same overwriting that affects line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lightly whimsical lyricism that suits the premise and Lira’s personality. Diction like “polite anarchy” and “rumor chains” feels intentional and patterned, giving the narrative a distinct texture. Occasionally the register trends toward abstract/philosophical summary, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity. There is good control of distance and a stable lens on Lira without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a clear lyrical texture that foregrounds sound and touch in ways appropriate to a blind focalizer. Diction is elevated but mostly controlled, with recurring phrases (“quiet blaze,” “inner seas”) building a recognizable cadence. POV boundaries are respected; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The risk is mild sameness in tone rather than any technical failure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends scientific and mythic diction (“contingent relationship between star and stone, pulse and silence”). The lyrical, slightly elevated register fits the speculative-lab setting and narrator’s role, and POV remains stable with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the voice leans into repetitive phrasing and similar syntactic beats that slightly flatten modulation. Overall, the texture is distinctive and controlled enough to be memorable, though not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, with consistent diction and a measured, incantatory rhythm that suits the subject. Psychic distance stays mostly in a close-omniscient lyrical range, occasionally widening to mention fishermen and dolphins in a way that feels intentional rather than sloppy. There are no dialogue or register clashes, and the brief POV shift to Lira is cleanly demarcated by time and focus. The voice is effective but not especially idiosyncratic; it reads as polished generic-poetic rather than unmistakably character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice has a consistent, gently elevated lyricism that fits the contemplative, mythic tone and the protagonist’s analytic yet sensuous attention to fire and art. Fire metaphors and volcanic imagery recur in a patterned way that builds a distinct texture rather than generic prettiness. Narrative stance stays within the arsonist’s perceptual bias (equations of color as equations of fire, stories traveling like flames), with no head-hopping or register slips. Some repetition of key phrases (“volcanic tenderness,” “bright and tender”) slightly blurs the edge of uniqueness but doesn’t seriously harm control.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with patterned metaphors, rhythmic sentenceing, and a stable psychic distance that fits the mythic, quasi-legendary frame. The diction (“auroral sorrow,” “entangled memories,” “liquid light”) builds a coherent tonal vocabulary, and perspective does not wander confusingly. Yet the voice sometimes overexplains thematic stakes in a register slightly more essayistic than the rest, diluting the enchantment. Overall, it’s a strong, recognizable voice but not yet an unmistakably singular one.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a confident, mildly lyrical register that fits the speculative-industrial setting. Diction like “a sound of calculated spontaneity” and “the storm’s electric tang” gives texture without sliding into full purple prose. POV boundaries are clean and there’s no head-hopping or clumsy exposition. Still, the voice feels more generally stylish than uniquely Milo-specific, and it doesn’t sharpen noticeably under moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is a stable, controlled third-person lyric mode with a distinct texture—measured cadence, recurring motifs, and an almost liturgical calm. Diction and syntax are consistent and suit the meditative, ritualistic content. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the brief shift to the fisherman’s perception is clean and contained. At times the register flirts with over-ornate, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistently lyrical, with a clear preference for metaphor and gentle cadences that fit the “amplified quiet” tone. POV distance is stable around Mara without leakage into other minds, and the narrative stance feels assured. Some repetitions of diction (“quiet,” “mist,” “second thoughts”) and uniformly elevated register risk a slightly homogeneous texture. Still, the piece maintains a distinct, recognizable voice that aligns with its ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a clear preference for lyrical, sea-inflected metaphors and elevated diction that suits the mythic frame. Phrases like “combative tenderness” and “tide-tamed fishermen” give the narration a recognizable texture without obvious head-hopping or stance confusion. Under stress, the voice does not meaningfully compress or fracture, which keeps it legible but also slightly smooths over moments that might benefit from sharper, more character-specific edges. Still, the POV control is solid and free of mechanical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctively solemn, ritualistic cadence that matches Mara’s performative narration. Diction and rhythm are generally well-controlled, and the limited interior access feels stable. Quoted narration (“I am cutting away the weight of grief…”) meshes with the external voice without jarring shifts. At times the register edges towards generalized lyricism rather than an unmistakably character-specific idiom, which keeps it just short of distinctive brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled syntactic variation and a stable close-third vantage anchored to the poet’s perceptions. The diction (“lantern-moth hush,” “cloud-shadow poet,” “ribbons of soft fire”) creates a distinct atmosphere and maintains it without head-hopping or register breaks. At times, the voice feels more like an authorial poetic narrator than a psychologically specific mind, which blurs the character’s perceptual signature. Still, rhythm and tone are well-handled, especially in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person, lyric-leaning voice is consistent and distinct, with strong image-making (e.g., shards of sunrise, the reed as a “breathing spine”). POV boundaries are clear, and the diction suits a sensibility attuned to texture and color despite colorblindness. Occasional repeated tags (“innocently cunning,” “bartered awakenings”) and uniformly elevated register risk a slight sameness of rhythm. Overall, though, the voice feels controlled and intentional rather than generically “poetic.”

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the speculative-ritual frame, with recurring diction (“texture,” “golden shadows,” “pilgrimage”) forming an intentional pattern. POV is stable and focalized through the bell ringer’s perspective and priorities, with no head-hopping. Rhythm is generally well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences suited to contemplation rather than high action. At times, the elevated register risks a degree of sameness and distance, but it never breaks plausibility for this quasi-mythic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is coherent, with a distinct, almost devotional rhythm that suits “subdued ardor.” Imagery and diction (“filament of intention,” “genuinely artificial glow”) repeat in ways that build a recognizable perceptual signature. There are mild instances of heaviness where key phrases are repeated and explained a touch too explicitly, but POV distance and stance remain stable and apt. Overall, the voice feels controlled and intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses occult and economic lexicons. Syntax and diction suit a contemplative, ritualized moment and avoid obvious register slips; the prose maintains a confident, controlled distance. Recurrent phrasings (“multiplying paths,” “inherited mystery”) feel like intentional leitmotifs rather than artifacts. The main limitation is that the voice stays at one elevated, incantatory register, with little modulation under supposed moments of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent and largely well-controlled, with a distinct texture built from repeated motifs and elevated diction that suits the mystical archive. Psychic distance stays steady; there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

Still, the rhythmic control and coherence of the chosen register keep the voice strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct sensibility (“sharp-eyed dusk noticer,” “cloud‑networks,” “blooming library”) that suits the quasi-mythic frame. Rhythm and diction are generally controlled, avoiding major register slips. At times, though, the vocabulary lapses into a generic mystical register (“gentle intention,” “luminous regret,” “rebirth of meaning”) that could belong to many similar pieces. The POV distance remains stable and legible, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the meditative tone; diction like “quietly vivid tapestry” and “shimmering stillness” feels intentional rather than random ornament. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Rhythmic control is solid, with a good mix of longer, sensuous sentences and shorter cadences near key beats (“She smiled faintly…”). At times the register trends slightly abstract, but it stays within a coherent stylistic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through this narrator’s sensibility, with a distinctive lexicon (“meteor hush,” “displaced miracle,” “dark artery”). POV is stable and modest in its claims, with no head-hopping or stance slippage. The rhythm and imagery choices feel intentional rather than generic, and the metaphoric intensity matches the story’s dreamlike, contemplative aims. At times the diction leans slightly toward uniform lushness, but it still reads as a coherent aesthetic rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture of metaphoric, cine-mystical perception that fits the crystal gazer’s work. Psychic distance stays relatively close without head-hopping, and the prose modulates smoothly through discovery and release. Patterned diction (“thunderous hush,” “whispered thunder”) feels deliberate rather than accidental. The lushness occasionally flirts with over-similarity of register, but control is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person lyric voice is stable, with controlled elevated diction and a consistent, dreamy rhythm. Imagery around stars, auroras, and music-of-the-cosmos establishes a distinct perceptual signature. At times the register borders on uniform—every sentence equally lush—so emotional peaks don’t modulate much in texture or cadence. Still, there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the stylistic choice holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, with recurring phrases (“fractured lullaby,” “unlit corners”) creating a recognizable signature. POV distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. Rhythmic modulation is decent, though the diction sometimes leans homogeneously elevated, which flattens peaks and valleys in intensity. Even so, the voice feels intentional and well-matched to the surreal, mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong lyric texture and a distinctive lexicon around mechanics and perception. Repetition of phrases like “hum of insight” and “wind through different trees” functions mostly as motif rather than artifact and supports the accumulative feel.

It feels like one stable sensibility guiding us through an altered reality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-to-Mira voice is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the fable-like mode. Recurrent phrasings (“shoreline lullaby,” “ticket punch with star stamp”) help pattern the cadence without fully lapsing into mechanical repetition. Narrative distance remains controlled; we never head-hop into the guides, and the gentle, incantatory rhythm modulates appropriately at the cave and sunrise moments. The limitation is that the lyricism feels more generally “poetic” than deeply particular to Mira’s mind, which keeps the voice from being truly distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with distinctive diction (“seraphically mundane,” “frostbitten hope”) and a stable narrative distance. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion; the stance is omniscient but controlled. Rhythm and syntax are mostly well managed, with long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative mode.

    The third-person mythic voice is controlled, consistent, and well-suited to the fable-like material, with phrases like “regally unpretentious” and “pause of shifting constellations” giving it a distinct texture. Psychic distance remains steady; we stay near the titan but with a slightly ceremonial narrative stance. There are no POV leaks or jarring register shifts, and the cadence modulates nicely from hushed description to climactic movement. A bit more character-specific perception, rather than generalized grandeur, would push the voice into truly distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly filtered through a consciousness attuned to oceans, maps, and ritual. Refrains like “drifting moored” and “periodically eternal” give the prose a distinct texture, even if they verge on self-conscious. Distance control is steady, with no head-hopping or POV confusion. At peak beats, the voice sometimes abstracts instead of tightening into more concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture and a distinctive lexicon (“thunderous serenity,” “key forged from starlight and steel”). POV control is clean, remaining anchored in the stargazer’s experiential frame without unmotivated shifts. Rhythms and sentence structures vary enough to avoid monotony and carry the atmospheric mode. At times the register flirts with over-elevation, but it still feels coherent with this character’s star-struck, myth-aware sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and suits the mythic-fantasy register; diction is consistent and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. Anara’s perceptions (plants’ whispers, mineral glimmer) color the narration enough to give a distinct texture, though the voice is more archetypal than sharply idiosyncratic. Rhythm is varied and mostly controlled, with long lyric sentences balanced by shorter cadences around key turns (the amber cracking, the infant’s gaze). The main limitation is that the voice rarely surprises; it’s polished but somewhat familiar for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on bodily cues, wind, and plant life. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, supporting a meditative pace without confusion. Occasional register drift into quasi-academic/therapeutic diction (“somatic markers,” “laboratory for that experiment”) slightly jars against the otherwise sensory, intimate voice. Overall, the POV is stable and effective, but trimming the analytic phrasing would heighten distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, lyrical register that matches the introspective, quasi-mystical material. Syntax and diction (“luminescent ache,” “threads of narrative,” “necessary darkness”) create a distinct perceptual signature, and there is no POV leakage or awkward shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is stable, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent third-person close focus on Kael and a recognizable cadence. Diction choices like “serene anger,” “vapor of memory,” and “ink of history” fit the elevated, speculative tone. There is some risk of register monotony and abstraction, but the piece largely avoids POV leakage or confusing stance shifts. The voice supports the accumulative, visionary mode even if it occasionally tells where it could trust images.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with recurring metaphors of ice, echo, and networks that give the narration a distinct texture. There are some distance shifts (from Maren’s perspective to omniscient views of distant citadels and councilors), but they read intentional rather than sloppy and suit the “networked” conceit. At times the diction edges toward purple or repetitive, yet the rhythm remains mostly controlled and the stance coherent. The voice feels more like a stylized narrative presence than deeply character-specific focalization, which is effective for this fable-like piece but limits psychological nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with recurring phrases (“tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet”) and a measured, ceremonial cadence that fits the healing mode. POV distance stays stable and there is no head-hopping. At times, diction drifts into generic elevated register and abstraction (“senselessly perceptive,” “stitching hope into fractured lives”) that feels more authorial than character-specific. The voice is competent and smooth but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is coherent and confident, with a distinct sonic texture in its diction and rhythm that suits the mythic mood. Patterns like “sound waves blooming,” “sleepwalking constellations,” and “feral lullaby” create a recognizable signature and are carried through to closure. At times the elevated register and density of metaphor blur individual beats and slightly flatten emotional gradation, as everything is equally numinous. Still, POV and distance remain stable, and the voice never breaks its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and full of distinctive images (e.g., “neon lights flickered like dying stars,” “meteor hush tone”). The diction and rhythm are coherent with Lyra’s world, and the poetic style is maintained without head-hopping or register collapse. At times the cadence and metaphor density flatten into a similar, incantatory feel across sentences, which slightly dulls contrast and emphasis. Still, the perceptual signature is clear and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct, dreamy diction and controlled psychic distance focused on Liora, then cleanly widening to include the violinist in a new shard. The narrative stance suits the accumulative, atmospheric mode and avoids head-hopping. Some phrasing veers toward abstract or label-like (“socially perceptive,” “emergent hush”) but remains within the established register. Rhythm and syntax are generally well-shaped, though they rarely vary to create sharp pressure spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction like “aberrant mercy,” “retrocognitively trapped,” and “warm coldness” creates a recognizable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a strong sensory signature (“rusted brass and liquid violet,” “colors that hummed in the hush of abandoned applause”). POV control is mostly clean; the late move into the shopkeeper’s sensations is a clear, contained focal shift that still fits the established narrative stance. Diction and rhythm suit the dreamy, magical-realist mode. A few phrases (“synesthetically blessed,” “possibility still lingered on the brink of despair”) feel slightly self-conscious, but not enough to derail the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical-technical blend (“fractally precise,” “somatic markers,” “willowglass”) that feels particular to Mara’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are generally well managed, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach her plausible knowledge. There is some repetition of favored phrases and a uniformly elevated register that risks sameness in emotional contour. Nonetheless, POV control is solid, and the prose texture is recognizably its own.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confidently handled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sensory and cartographic language. Diction like “sensory map maker,” “factually mystical,” and “heat-mapping emotions” feels deliberate and world-specific without drifting into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)

Diction and syntax are consistent, with patterned phrases (“quietly inspired,” “raw possibility,” “as the truth unravels”) giving the piece a recognizable cadence. That said, the voice is more generically poetic than distinctly Mara-specific, so it lacks the sharp idiosyncrasy that would elevate it to top-tier literary distinctiveness. Overall, it is controlled and apt, if not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and mostly well-controlled, with a clear preference for metaphor and elevated diction that suits the fable-like tone. POV distance is fairly consistent, though it sometimes feels more like an omniscient lyrical narrator than a tightly focalized spy’s inner language. There are no major slips in tense or stance, and the rhythm has some variation. The voice, while polished, leans toward generic-poetic rather than distinctly character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with elevated but consistent lyric diction that suits the meditative mode. Recurrent phrases (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest,” “ambient awareness”) create a coherent sonic pattern rather than feeling randomly repetitive. Psychic distance stays close to Arlen’s perceptions and does not slip into unjustified authorial omniscience. While the register is quite high, it feels unified and purposeful rather than patchwork.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)

Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (light, thrum, breath) giving the prose a recognizable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a consistent cadence and lexicon. Patterned phrases (“rhythm of oars in water,” “quivering hush”) and repeated silver/light imagery create a recognizable texture without becoming fully monotonous.

That said, the voice sometimes smooths over potential sharpness or strangeness in favor of prettiness, which slightly reduces distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and image-driven, with a distinct lexicon (“tidal library,” “sea of ink,” “atomically reflective”) that feels unified rather than generic. Third-person focalization stays tightly on Mira’s perceptions; no head-hopping or stance confusion appears. Rhythms and sentence shapes vary enough to avoid monotony, and patterned repetitions (hum, light, tide) read as intentional motifs. The main limitation is that the high, almost incantatory register remains steady throughout, with little modulation to mirror moments of doubt or strain.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, confident, and texturally rich, with recurring phrases that support a cohesive aesthetic (“prismatic quiet,” hums, threads, whispers). The perceptual signature is stable—everything is filtered through a sensibility attuned to secrets, letters, and quiet beauty—without POV slippage. At times the diction leans toward generalized poeticism (“rainbow hush of the temple,” “keeper of secrets” repeated) rather than character-specific language, slightly flattening individuality. Still, stance and distance are well controlled, and the voice suits the story’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a nice blend of technical and mythic diction (“subsonic frequencies” alongside “ancient legend of cosmic tricksters”). The narrative distance is stable and confident, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the register veers toward lofty abstractions that repeat (“power plays,” “cautiously hopeful,” “balance”), slightly dulling the voice’s edge. Overall, the perceptual signature is competent and occasionally striking, but not yet distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinct fondness for paradox (“prudently adventurous”), rebellion metaphors, and architectural imagery. Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, creating a unified perceptual signature that fits the quasi-mystical exploration. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative distance remains stable. Occasionally the register leans toward abstract poetics at the expense of sharp, character-specific noticing, but it never becomes incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close/lyric-omniscient voice is consistent, with a clear preference for metaphor and ritualistic phrasing that suits the quasi-mystical premise. Diction like “lance the void of forgotten sorrow” or “strange alchemy of rigor and compassion” creates a distinct texture and perceptual bias. At times, the register leans toward purple and repetitive (reiterating compassion/empathy/unifying opposites) which slightly dulls its sharpness under pressure. Still, the voice holds steady, and its cadences match the story’s contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture of meteorological and archival imagery filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the “spongey dread” refrain becomes a tonal hallmark rather than a tic. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice differentiation, but the narrative stance stays stable and believable in its knowledge limits. Under peak stress, the voice retains its slightly heightened lyricism without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable texture—river echoes in the violin case, wind writing letters, chemical fog, pixelated squares. Diction and syntax are controlled, if quite uniform in their elevated, mystical register. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; focalization remains close to the fiddler’s perceptions. The lack of modulation (very little grit or plainness) slightly flattens emotional contrast but doesn’t break the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly lyrical register that fits Arlen’s reflective, observant nature. Phrasings like “dusky harmony” and “polished calm” recur as motifs rather than tics, and the narrative distance stays consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional and believable, especially Arlen’s gentle, rail-focused argument with Maya. Occasionally the register slips toward essayistic abstraction, but not enough to fracture POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly anchored in Mara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and emotional temperature. Patterns like “midnight solace,” “variable stars,” and scented imagery create a recognizable texture without breaking POV boundaries. At times, the register drifts toward generalized poeticism rather than character-particular thought, making the voice feel more authorial than idiosyncratically Mara. Still, control of rhythm and distance is strong enough for publication-level quality with some tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable cadence and recurring warlike/serene imagery that suits the material. Syntax and diction hold together across the scene, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register moves toward generalized “fantasy-poetic” rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Still, the voice is controlled and confident enough to be a strength rather than a liability.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a clear textural pattern—elevated diction, synesthetic phrasing, and recurring image-systems (light, scars, filaments). POV distance stays stable and appropriate; we never head-hop, and interior access aligns with what the visionary can plausibly perceive or intuit. At times the register edges into generalized abstraction (“tapestry of collective desire,” “luminous threads of hope”), which can blunt immediacy, but the pattern is controlled rather than erratic. Overall, the voice is distinctive and mostly well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinctive, lush lyricism that suits the gothic-fantastical setting. Diction, syntax, and rhythm are largely controlled, and key phrases (“dusky resolve,” “inlaying meaning”) form a recognizable verbal pattern. However, the register skews uniformly elevated and abstract, which sometimes distances us from Maelia’s specific perceptions and embodied reactions. A few plainer, more grounded moments could sharpen contrast and deepen the sense that this voice belongs uniquely to her consciousness rather than an impersonal lyrical narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is stable, reflective, and plausibly colored by both roadie and appraiser sensibilities, with a consistent perceptual signature (attention to texture, patina, sound). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the tone carries through the piece. There is some elevated diction and metaphor density, but it fits a narrator in a contemplative, post-crisis mode rather than feeling wholly imposed. With no dialogue to test differentiation, POV control remains strong and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical, speculative texture that fits the material and maintains a consistent psychic distance. Diction is generally apt and character-colored via her scholarly, contemplative perspective, and there’s no head-hopping. Rhythms vary reasonably, and the narrator doesn’t over-explain what images already carry. Occasional abstractions and slightly generic formulations (“gentle reestablishment of balance”) keep it from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lucid, lyrical texture that suits the mythic, contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm (“a sunrise trapped in stone,” “wintersun serenity”) form a distinct perceptual signature without slipping into incoherence or register clashes. Psychic distance remains steady, never head-hopping, and the narrator’s calm certainty fits the timeless, fable-like frame. The lyricism may be a touch uniform emotionally, but it supports rather than obscures the story’s moves.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent reverent distance that suits the mythic tone. Phrasing like “each step echoing like a heartbeat paused at the edge of a hesitation” shows a clear rhythmic and stylistic intention. At times, the diction becomes uniform—“resonant hush,” “latent radiance,” “halo of hope”—such that the narrator’s texture feels more generic-poetic than distinctly Mara’s. Still, there is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the voice carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, textured, and recognizable, with a strong perceptual signature (mapping metaphors, attention to tools like tape and bellows, and an almost liturgical regard for the river). Diction and syntax are lyrically elevated but feel organic to a self-consciously “methodical” chronicler; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice modulates well from ache to tentative solace, maintaining cohesion. Minor repetition of key phrases slightly flattens some beats, but overall control and distinctiveness are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is stable, clear, and comfortably lyrical, with recurring technical motifs (“propagation delays,” “cyclically reversed”) giving it a slight conceptual tilt. POV is consistent and modest; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the diction often feels like generalized high-fantasy-poetic rather than a sharply individual consciousness, and the narrator’s inner texture doesn’t modulate much under changing circumstances. The result is competent and pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a confident lyricism that suits Elara’s sensibility as a provenance researcher surrounded by arcane instruments and living vines. Diction (“perforated destiny,” “mulberry ache,” “skyward garden”) is distinctive and pattern-consistent without obvious register drops. The narrative distance is well controlled, maintaining a tight focus on Elara’s perceptions even as it touches cosmic or political stakes. At times the lushness flirts with uniformity of tone, but it does not slip into confusion or unmotivated POV drift.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, ritualistic scene. Diction like “radiant hush,” “lucidly watchful,” and “threshold of stillness” creates a recognizably consistent texture without major register slips. There is no dialogue to test modulation, but internal focus and external description feel of a piece with this character and world. Under pressure, the voice maintains control and does not fracture or flatten.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative mode. Imagery like “vineyard hush,” “umbral grotto,” and “her heart scalloping” gives it a recognizable texture without major register slips. Psychic distance stays consistent and there’s no head-hopping. That said, some diction trends toward generalized abstraction (“source of contentment,” “cycle that binds all living things”), keeping it from feeling singular or sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story’s meditative register, with a distinct lexicon around nuance, doubt, and reflection. Rhythm and sentence structure show control, and motifs like “conscience for hire” and “protected vulnerability” recur in a pattern that feels intentional rather than accidental. There’s some tendency toward conceptual phrasing, but it generally aligns with the elevated, fable-like tone. No POV slippage or stance confusion undermines the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinctive texture of natural imagery and gentle mysticism that matches Mira’s contemplative focus. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent, and the narrative stance doesn’t wobble or head-hop. At times, the language feels more like an authorial poetic register than a fully character-particular interiority, but it remains internally consistent and legible. Modulation with intensity is subtle yet present, particularly around the grotto’s vortex and the final repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, reverent mood; diction and syntax maintain a coherent, elevated texture. There’s a clear perceptual signature in the focus on sound, vibration, and bone-tower imagery, and psychic distance remains stable. At times, the voice lapses into generalized “epic” register rather than something idiosyncratically hers, which slightly flattens character-specificity. Still, control and cohesion are strong enough to feel publishable with light refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-ish lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable texture built from contrasts like “brilliant dimness” and “mechanized fireworks” versus “dim candle.” Diction is elevated but coherent with the contemplative, fable-like register of the piece, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies reasonably well and the perceptual filter stays anchored in Selric’s sensibility. At times the narration feels more like an essayistic commentator than an embodied mind under stress, but the distance is stable and intentional rather than sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with recurring coinages like “meteor hush” giving it a recognizable signature. Psychic distance stays consistent, and the narration doesn’t claim knowledge Eli couldn’t plausibly infer within this mythic frame. Rhythm modulates reasonably well between description and movement, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the diction veers toward uniformly elevated, but it still feels tonally intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical, speculative texture anchored in Silas’s cosmically tuned perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled; phrases like “stellar doubt” and “backwards prophecy” feel voice-appropriate and unify the piece. However, the register sometimes flattens into a homogeneous, elevated tone that risks making individual moments blur together rather than modulating sharply under pressure. No POV slippage or mechanical issues interfere with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear perceptual signature centered on echoes, light, and names. Diction is elevated but coherent with the mythic-fantastical frame and Lira’s reaper status; there’s no noticeable head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony while maintaining a meditative cadence suited to an accumulative piece. The voice feels singular and controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the quietly fantastical material. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that favors image and gentle abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. The main limitation is a slight sameness of register—moments of heightened pressure aren’t distinctly sharpened in the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative material. Diction and rhythm have a distinct texture without becoming opaque, and focalization stays cleanly with Caitlyn’s sensibility. There are a few slightly mannered phrases (“a gait that was precisely humane”) that risk feeling writerly rather than character-filtered. Overall, though, the narrative stance feels confident and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with diction that suits an alchemical, myth-tinged fantasy. The narrative perspective stays anchored in Selene’s experience without head-hopping or jarring distance shifts. Rhythmic control is generally strong, even if the high-register imagery is relentless. The piece reads as a distinct, intentional voice rather than generic fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, elevated lyric register that suits the fable-like ambiance. Phrasing such as “cathedral of leaves,” “soundless echo,” and “silent metronome” gives the prose a recognizable texture and perceptual signature. At times, the diction edges toward a generalized poeticism that feels more authorial than character-specific, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity. Psychic distance and tense remain controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that matches the mythic-lyric register of the premise. Phrases like “blade forged from his own paradoxical truth” and “sea of shifting chronologies” give the narration a distinct texture without losing clarity. There is occasional drift into generalized or explanatory language (“The method was simple yet profound”) that flattens the otherwise resonant voice. Overall, POV control is solid and stable, but the voice feels more “conceptual fantasy narrator” than deeply individualized to Kael’s psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and suitably lyrical for the quasi-fantastical premise; diction and rhythm are generally controlled. The focalization through Mara is consistent, if somewhat distant, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing leans toward generic “poetic” abstraction (“soft thrum of potential,” “rewrite the night itself”), which blurs her individual perceptual signature. Still, the overall voice feels confident and coherent rather than committee-written.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“blade of sound,” “mournfully eager,” “tending to the unspoken”) and controlled psychic distance that stays close to the conductor’s mythic function rather than his mundane interiority. Rhythm and syntax are varied and often musical, fitting the quasi-liturgical tone of the ritual. There is some hover between character-bound perceptions and an omniscient, authorial register, but the piece commits enough to its fable-like stance that it doesn’t feel like head-hopping. At times the diction leans toward purple, but it maintains a coherent aesthetic rather than drifting across registers.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and distinct, with a mythic, lyrical register that fits the surreal setting. Phrases like “sang in rusted syllables” and “interiorizing exteriors” give the piece a recognizable texture. At times the diction drifts toward abstraction and pseudo-profundity, which can slightly blunt immediacy, but it remains coherent with the chosen mode. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive diction pattern around embers, twilight, and quiet wonder that matches the alchemist’s sensibility. Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or POV leakage. At times, the narration leans into a slightly homogenized, emblematic register—sentences feel crafted to theme rather than strictly to the character’s idiosyncratic noticing. Even so, modulation from hushed early stasis to a more charged, luminous close works well and remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive: a blend of technical lexicon (“quantum coil,” “frequency”) with lyric description that suits a “celestial signal interpreter.” Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled, with recurring phrases (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”) that feel like intentional motifs rather than tics. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays reasonably tight to Selin’s way of perceiving. Occasionally the register drifts toward generalized aphorism at the end, softening the impact, but not enough to confuse POV.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close POV is steady and coherent; we never lose track of who’s seeing and choosing. The voice has a consistent, mildly ornate lyricism that suits the metaphysical premise. Still, the diction feels more generalized-fantastical than distinctly Lio-shaped, so the perceptual signature is pleasant but not deeply individual. There are no POV slips or register jolts that would undercut control.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable and confident, with a recognizable cadence and lexicon that suits a “fever dream architect” in a rationally enchanted space. Diction like “realistically imaginary choreography” and “statues of possibility” feels intentional and character-appropriate rather than generic. There’s good rhythmic variation at the sentence level, and no POV leakage or stance confusion. At times, the register risks uniform lushness without sharp shifts to mirror internal pressure, which limits its upper-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the lyric, conceptual mode, with a clear perceptual bias toward navigation and light. There’s good control of distance—mostly close enough to feel Mira’s focus, but often drifting toward omniscient summary in a way that still reads intentional. Some diction choices (“balancedly curious,” repeated abstract phrasing) feel slightly mechanical rather than organic to a human mind. Overall, the voice is competent and distinctive, but not yet remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—phrases like “contact tracer for hearts” and “cartographer of sighs” signal a strong stylistic identity. POV is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the cadence generally suits the contemplative, ghostly subject. At times the register edges toward over-elevated or purple, but this is mostly held in check by consistent tone and imagery. The voice is memorable and coherent, though not yet surprising or idiosyncratic enough to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lush, maritime-technical lexicon that suits the premise and maintains a coherent psychic distance. Diction like “phase transition arrays” and “crashing hush” feels of a piece, and the narrative never strays into mismatched registers or head-hopping. At times the lyrical density risks sameness of texture, but it remains legible and controlled. The perceptual filter is more story-voice than deeply individualized Mara-voice, yet it’s distinct and aesthetically unified.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably lyrical for the material, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette (glass domes, ink sigils, crystalline whispers). Technical terms (quantum server, algorithm) are woven into the same poetic register without jarring shifts. There’s no dialogue to test, but interior access and descriptive rhythm modulate well with the unfolding ritual. Occasionally, the diction verges on abstract, but it largely remains anchored in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—“black swifts sliced the wind, their wings flashing like punctuation marks”—and maintains consistent psychic distance. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a clear perceptual signature oriented toward sound and texture. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” tone; the narration feels aligned with the storyteller’s sensibility. The only limitation is that the lofty register is steady throughout, with little modulation to mirror moments of higher internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The first-person voice is steady, confident, and generally well-matched to a reflective, slightly poetic operative; the repeated use of phrases like “gravitationally playful” helps create a recognizable texture. The lyric register is mostly consistent, with few jarring shifts or clumsy constructions, and POV control is clean. At times the diction edges toward over-mannered abstraction (“a story of redemption, a frostbitten hope that turned the dark into a joke shared across dimensions”), which distances us slightly from immediacy. Still, for the most part the voice is distinctive and coherent under the accumulative, surreal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the fable-like, fantastical material, with consistent elevated diction and rhythmic sentences. Patterns like “resonantly soft” and “signal through heart rhythms” function as incantatory motifs rather than clumsy repetition, and there is no head-hopping. The narrative distance stays mostly in a mythic-lyric middle ground, which fits but limits deeper psychological nuance. At times the uniform loftiness of tone flattens modulation; sharper shifts in rhythm or texture at moments of risk would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, gently surreal lyricism that fits the speculative setting (“his coat flapping like a banner of surrender,” “a metallic bird scouting the border”). Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, and the focalization does not wobble. At times the narrator’s register drifts toward generalized philosophizing more than Milo-specific perception, which slightly flattens the perceptual signature. Still, the voice is confident and recognizably its own.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, with consistent diction and cadence that fit the dreamlike, mystical frame. Recurrent phrases (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” “quietly persistent”) create a recognizable texture and the psychic distance remains steady. That said, the voice feels more like an impersonal poetic narrator than Mara’s particular consciousness, blurring character-specific perception. Modulation under emotional pressure is limited—the tone remains uniformly hushed and reverent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative-conceptual material, with controlled diction that blends scientific and poetic registers smoothly. POV distance is consistent: we stay close enough to Mara’s perceptions to feel guided by her, but the narration never lapses into omniscient head-hopping. Rhythmic control is strong; long, flowing sentences suit the contemplative tone without becoming incoherent. The main limitation is that the voice, while polished, flattens emotional volatility—it describes marvels beautifully but rarely sharpens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a consistent lexicon around light, sea, and longing that feels intentional rather than generic. The psychic distance is well-managed, allowing intimate access to Mara’s sensibility while maintaining a fable-like narratorial smoothness. There are some tendencies toward sameness of register and imagery that flatten peaks—nearly everything is rendered in similarly glowing, hushed terms. Still, there is clear rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature that holds through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable and confident, with controlled rhythm and a consistent register of cosmic reverie. Phrases like “hush of cosmic possibility” and “tapestry woven from forgotten dreams” define the piece’s texture and are sustained without head-hopping or stance wobble. Yet the diction leans on familiar speculative-poetic formulas, so the perceptual signature feels polished but not truly distinctive. Under pressure, the voice does not sharpen or fracture; it maintains a uniform haze instead of modulating to heighten key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensorially rich, and colored by the folklorist’s mythic/fieldwork lens (constellations, memory currents, lullabies). Syntax varies enough to sustain rhythm, and the diction feels unified in a slightly elevated, lyrical register. Occasional abstract pronouncements (“stories are alive even when the soil is salt-soaked”) are on-theme but risk sounding authorial rather than strictly character-bound. Overall, POV control and voice are strong and publication-ready with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the archivist’s sensibility, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm that suit the fable-like, speculative atmosphere. Patterned phrases (e.g., “combative tenderness,” “reversible exile”) are reused intentionally enough to feel like motifs rather than tics, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative distance remains steady, with a controlled blend of interiority and external observation. At times the diction is slightly more abstract than her embodied situation warrants, but this is a minor mismatch rather than a structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The omniscient-lyric voice is consistent, with controlled diction and a recognizable cadence (e.g., “radiant hush,” “color of wonder,” “weaving between worlds” recur as tonal anchors). Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from becoming fully monotonous, and the point of view doesn’t slip confusingly. That said, the elevated register can feel generic-lyrical rather than distinctly character-bound, and repeated phrasing edges toward self-parody in places. The voice is polished and legible but not yet singular or surprising at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a strong sensory and metaphorical palette. Diction and syntax match the meditative, ritualistic situation, and there’s no POV leakage or confusion. While the cadence leans toward uniform, it suits the piece’s “lucid unrest” tone and rarely feels mechanical. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable in a high-level publication context.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and distinctively lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature oriented around cartography, silence, and physical detail. Syntax and diction are controlled and consistent with a reflective, almost ritualistic mood. There’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition; the voice modulates gently with the climactic alignment of images without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and mostly aligned with Mort’s “quietly analytic” disposition, blending scientific metaphor with mournful poetics. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (knots, currents, transmission) giving the prose a recognizable texture. At times, the narrative register drifts toward abstract essayistic commentary that feels more like an authorial layer than Mort’s own mental cadence. Still, POV remains consistent and legible with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctive, with consistent diction that suits the mythic-techno premise (“tinkersong of electric hues,” “ghost in code”). Rhythm and syntax are controlled and varied enough to avoid monotony, and the accumulative sentence patterns feel intentional. POV distance stays coherent around the balladeer, with no intrusive shifts or expository overreach. The voice leans ornamental at times but rarely tips into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with controlled, elevated diction that matches the mythic-fantasy register. The perceptual filter—attentive to mechanisms, light, and emotional residues—feels consistent with his role as caretaker and seeker. Rhythms are generally smooth, though occasionally weighed down by similar syntactic patterns and repeated turns of phrase. There is no POV leakage or confusing slippage, and the narrative stance feels coherent through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive lyric texture—“dust‑filled night,” “moth’s wing,” “ledger of loss and love”—and stays consistent in diction and distance. The narrative filters details through Aria’s vocation and obsession with the sky, giving it a clear perceptual signature. Some phrases and metaphors repeat (“quietly explosive,” “spooled wholeness”), but the cadence and syntax remain controlled rather than mechanical. Overall, the voice feels deliberate, confident, and suited to a high-literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly mystical texture that suits Lira’s perceptual peculiarities and the fantastical setting. Phrasing like “fractually precise” and “a whisper of copper” gives the narration a recognizable cadence and sensibility, and the point of view never wobbles or overreaches what Lira could plausibly sense. There is some risk of tonal sameness—almost every line hums at the same lyrical register, even during moments that should feel more urgent—but it doesn’t break clarity. Controlled modulation (slightly starker, plainer diction during peak pressure) could heighten contrast and make the climax land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to a contemplative, fantastical airship vignette. Diction like “sociable isolation” and “stranded luminance” establishes a distinct texture without major register slips or POV leakage. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the perspective stays bound to Lira’s sensibility. It’s strong, though a hair more modulation under moments of heightened pressure could sharpen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with recurring image families (driftwood, frost, light, clouds) that feel purposeful rather than random. Psychic distance is consistent and suits a mythic/fable-like tone; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the diction leans into slightly generalized loftiness (“hauntingly bright,” “endless voyages for those who could mend”) that feels less character-specific than the strongest lines. Still, rhythm and syntax are mostly well controlled and support the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The omniscient third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a distinct texture (“floating rock arches that sang softly when the wind passed through them,” “brambled hope”). Diction and syntax feel consistent with a mythic, fable-like narrator, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and key images are given room without over-explanation. The voice is polished and pleasant but not quite singular or surprising enough at sentence level to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lexicon (“pane of hush,” “bruised awe,” “river of silver light”) that feels native to this consciousness. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, incantatory sentences and shorter emphatic lines at turns like the world’s pause. There is no POV leakage or unnecessary exposition; the narration stays anchored in Elara’s way of seeing. A slight tendency toward reiterative phrasing keeps it just shy of the very top tier, but the voice would be competitive in strong literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, vivid, and sensibly elevated for this kind of fable-like fantasy, with strong metaphors like “as if the orchard itself were a patient surgeon” and “the labyrinth stretching behind me like a wound.” POV discipline holds; we never leave the caretaker’s perceptual frame, and the lyric compression remains legible. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the diction feels like an intentional, slightly archaic narrative stance rather than generic prose. At times the narrator glosses complex processes (“I have spent the past months assembling clues”) where a more scene-based voice might deepen immediacy, but the overall texture is distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice, with its blend of scientific and musical metaphors, creates a distinct perceptual signature that feels true to Mara. Diction and rhythm are consistent, and the lyric compression doesn’t obscure basic clarity or causality. There’s minimal dialogue, but summary of others’ reactions reads naturally within the narrative stance. A few lines verge on abstract or thematically declarative, but overall the POV control and texture are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled syntax and a clear taste for luminous, slightly baroque diction. Phrases like “knife of light,” “vapor‑woven aisles,” and “weight of his quest dissolve into the very air” give the piece a distinct texture. At times the narration feels more like an impersonal oracle than a vendor-specific consciousness, which flattens POV depth and emotional nuance. Still, distance and tense are stable, and the patterned, incantatory rhythm suits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and sensorially rich, with a strong focus on gustatory and tactile detail befitting a memory-tasting chef. Diction is consistent, leaning poetic without jarring register shifts, and the narrative distance stays controlled. The perceptual signature—equating emotion with flavor, architecture with memory—is distinctive, though sometimes more narratorial than deeply character-idiosyncratic. Absence of dialogue keeps the focus tight and avoids any POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct, elevated diction that suits the fable-like conceit and keeps a steady psychic distance. Phrasing like “vigorous tenderness” and “borrowed starlight” gives the narration a clear signature, and there’s no head-hopping. At times, the register trends toward generalized abstraction rather than the librarian’s particular sensibility, which slightly flattens her perceptual fingerprint. Still, rhythm and stance are controlled and coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is a consistent, lyrical third person closely aligned with Aria’s hybrid of scientific and visionary perception, with patterned diction around helixes, lattices, and reverie. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the register—though elevated—feels intentional and suited to a quasi-mystical SF vignette. There is no head-hopping and no dialogue to test, so focalization remains clean and stable. At peak beats, the voice sometimes tips toward uniform rhapsody, but it never becomes incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, gently baroque diction that suits an archivist in a fantastical city. Lexical choices like “prism-mind,” “threshold effects,” and “latent blaze” build a recognizable texture, and psychic distance remains stable. Repetition of key adjectives (“clandestinely luminous,” “latent blaze”) reads as motif rather than accident, though the density of coined phrases occasionally flirts with sameness. Overall, the narrative stance feels controlled and appropriate for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature in its musical, textural focus. Refrains like “empathy in motion,” “symphonically minded,” and “intensely quiet” establish pattern rather than feeling like random tics. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable. At times the elevated diction verges on uniform, reducing modulation across emotional beats, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with elevated but controlled diction that matches the contemplative, mystical register of the tutor’s mind. Chess, covenant, and sky metaphors create a distinct perceptual signature, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing and concept repetition (“hopeful melancholy,” “hidden beauty,” “difficult positions”) dulls the edge and flirts with self-conscious solemnity. Sharper modulation—occasional plainer strokes amid the lyricism—would make the voice feel less uniformly incantatory and more alive.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and metaphor-heavy, with a recognizable flair (“windows black as midnight parchment,” “sympathy of unheard moments”). The third-person close perspective stays stable and doesn’t head-hop, and the theatrical diction fits the protagonist’s stagey self-presentation. At times the phrasing turns self-conscious or clunky (“his intuition intuitively descriptive”), revealing the machinery of style. Still, the voice is distinctive enough to be memorable and generally under control.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close/fable-like voice is steady, and the sensory lexicon (perfume, hush, tide’s thought) is distinctive and coherent. However, some diction choices (“olfactorily sensitive nose,” “journalize”) feel forced by prompt constraints rather than organic to the voice, slightly breaking the spell. Rhythm is generally smooth, but recurrent phrasing (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush”) can feel templated rather than strategically patterned. POV distance and access stay consistent with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a controlled, mildly lyrical register suited to the speculative setting. Phrases like “whirling silence” and “silver veins” recur to create texture without breaking POV boundaries. There is little modulation of distance under stress, partly because stress itself is low, so the voice never has to stretch. Overall, it’s clean and pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and shaped by Mara’s technical sensibility, blending instrumentation vocabulary with lyric description of wind. The perceptual signature—reading the world through airflow, velocity, and vectors—is distinctive and sustained. Rhythm and diction are generally controlled, with occasional slightly ornate phrasing but no serious register slips or POV leaks. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance feels stable and apt for the piece’s quiet, procedural magic.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with an identifiable texture built on synesthetic crossings of sound and color. POV distance is mostly steady third-person close, occasionally tilting omniscient for thematic statements, but without confusion. Rhythms and diction support the contemplative, numinous mood, though they sometimes drift toward homogeneity of cadence and register. The lack of dialogue sidesteps one complexity but also limits opportunities for sharper, more differentiated voice work under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and tonally unified, with a clear perceptual signature built around sound, silence, and ritual detail. Diction like “avalanchingly quiet,” “canyon hush,” and “weaving of worlds” feels intentional and pattern-taught, giving the piece a distinctive texture. At times the register flirts with abstraction and repetition, but not enough to blur POV or harm clarity. Overall, the voice is confident and controlled, even if it occasionally over-explains theme.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with controlled, lyrical syntax and a distinctive lexicon that matches the story’s speculative-literary ambitions. Diction like “transposed function,” “halo fragment,” and “lucid turbulence” coheres tonally and feels aligned with Mara’s quasi-mystical, quasi-mathematical mindset. Psychic distance stays stable; we never head-hop or slip into an incongruent register. At times the narrative edges toward self-conscious abstraction, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads as deliberate style rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic, accumulative mode, with recurring phrases and images providing a clear texture. Diction is consistent and avoids jarring register shifts, and the narrative distance holds close enough to the courier’s perceptions while allowing some broader mythic framing. At times, the voice leans toward repetition and overt theme-labeling, which flattens subtext. Still, the perceptual signature (objects humming with memory and potential) is distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Liora’s perceptual biases—scientific grounding blended with mystical attentiveness. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (“shifted hush,” quartz, frost, prism) reinforcing the piece’s texture without confusion. There’s no POV leakage or awkward elision; the narrative stance feels confident and stable. Occasionally the narratorial register leans slightly more essayistic than her interior voice, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Mara’s textile/loom sensibility, giving the narration a distinct texture. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled and apt for the mythic, fable-like mode, with patterned phrases like “raveling silence” reinforcing the design. At times the register becomes slightly ornate in ways that feel more authorial than character-specific, but it does not break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a lyrical, slightly incantatory diction that suits the mythic tone ("fields of sapphire fruit glittering," "his mind a twin horizon of hope and doubt"). Recurrent phrasings and rhythms ("quietly determined," "azure defiance") feel like intentional patterning rather than mechanical artifact, and psychic distance is well controlled. There’s no head-hopping or register shock; the narration’s elevated style matches the fable-like world. At times the lyricism risks smoothing over sharper, character-specific textures, but overall the voice is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Lira’s sensory-mapping profession. Diction (“cartographic ribbons,” “lattice of possibilities”) coheres with her role and the story’s speculative register. At times the register slips into slightly generic abstraction, but not enough to blur identity or distance. Overall, the POV control and rhythmic texture are strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical cadence that suits Marek’s “warmly observant” nature. Diction is mostly consistent and character-appropriate, with good control of rhythm in sentences like “each stone a silent punctuation to an anonymous letter chain he imagined.” The narration doesn’t head-hop and maintains a coherent psychic distance throughout. At times the lyricism becomes uniform, with similar emotional notes repeating, which slightly flattens modulation across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled, poetic diction that matches the mythic, ritualistic mode. The storm herald’s laughter and Mira’s solemn resolution provide distinct tonal registers within the same narrative stance, avoiding head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous, and figurative choices usually feel apt to the world. At times, the narration sounds more like an external myth-teller than Mira’s specific perception, which slightly dilutes the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lira’s sensibility as a dye master attuned to color and light. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; the piece teaches its poetic mode early and sustains it without head-hopping or register shocks. Repetition of certain coined phrases (“quietly explosive,” “iridescent caution”) reveals the prompt’s scaffolding but doesn’t break the voice’s integrity. The main limitation is a relative sameness of tonal register across all beats, with minimal modulation as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, magical-realist mode. Diction like “lattice of sorrow,” “dream‑data,” and “mundane miracles” creates a distinct perceptual signature without major register breaks. The narrative distance remains consistent, with interiority and description braided smoothly. Some phrasing risks sameness (“quantified sorrow” recurs a bit mechanically), but overall control is confident.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable rhythm and diction that suits the fantastical setting. Repetitions like “woven dawns” and “bound release” create a deliberate incantatory feel rather than simple redundancy, and POV distance is stable. There’s little modulation of register or texture to mirror shifts in pressure, which slightly blunts climactic beats. Still, the voice feels controlled and unified rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical and aligned with a reclusive, contemplative mind, with recurring cadences (“settled like fog,” “hidden in plain sight”) that feel intentional rather than random. POV distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the voice modulates gently between external description and interior realization. Occasionally the diction (“enlarged tranquility,” “nested paradoxes” repeated) flirts with self-consciousness, but it does not break the spell or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythms and a clear perceptual signature centered on patient noticing. Diction is consistently elevated but not egregiously out of register, and the POV does not leak or wobble. Recurring formulations (e.g., reuse of “heuristically gentle,” “uncloak”) and occasionally ornate constructions lightly telegraph the prompt scaffolding. Overall, the voice is strong and publishable-adjacent but not yet singular enough to feel indispensable at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is steady and lyrically controlled, with a distinct lexicon (“quartz hush,” “vaulted ceiling,” “glacial marble”) that matches the protagonist’s meticulous, ritualistic mindset. Rhythm and diction are consistent and confident; the sentence music supports the dreamy, accumulative atmosphere. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the narrative distance is well managed. A slight sameness of tone across the whole piece keeps it from feeling fully modulated under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical texture that fits the noirish, liminal setting. Diction and rhythm generally feel deliberate, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narration drifts toward abstract formulations and repeated phrases (“curiously steadfast,” “comforting unease”) that slightly blunt its distinctiveness and immediacy. Still, the perceptual signature—sensory, tide-and-time conscious, wary but determined—comes through clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature centered on synesthetic and techno-organic metaphors. Diction and rhythm support the futuristic nostalgia tone without obvious register slips or head-hopping, and the narrative stance feels plausibly aligned with Arin’s mind. Patterns like “terrestrially cosmic” and “planet’s sighs” recur in a way that feels intentional rather than generic. The modulation at the end toward a softer, lullaby cadence is effective and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly focused through Lena’s sensibility, with consistent diction around light, memory, and sorrow. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the patterned metaphors feel intentional for a mythic-lyric mode. At times the narration leans into slightly generic “poetic” phrasing (“a river of possibility,” “silence’s secret heart”) that flattens the otherwise distinct texture. Overall, POV control and voice are strong, if not fully singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the fable-like, speculative mood, with a distinct textural idiom (“breathing misty sighs,” “puzzle of memory”). Psychic distance is steady; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative stance feels confidently controlled. At times the register slides toward generalized abstraction when articulating theme, slightly weakening the character-specific feel of the perception. Overall, though, the voice is memorable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a gentle, contemplative cadence well-matched to the content. Recurrent diction (“glisten,” “silent,” “mute,” “wonder”) creates a patterned music that suits the accumulative form. At times, abstraction and repeated phrasing risk a slight sameness of rhythm and reduce the sense of a sharply individuated perceptual signature. Even so, POV stance is stable and the overall voice feels polished and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Vira is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical, slightly meditative tone that suits a nostalgic android focalizer. Diction (“inner static,” “fragmented wholeness,” “sleek metal core”) feels character-appropriate and gives the prose a distinctive texture. The narrative distance stays controlled, and there’s no head-hopping or unexplained stance shift. At peaks, the voice could risk slightly more compression or abrasion to mirror stress, but control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable and generally well-controlled, with a consistent lyrical texture and some nice rhythmic moments. Repeated phrases (“sandstorm calm,” “locked mailbox mystery,” “led through following”) create pattern but also risk feeling slightly templated and over-insistent. Psychic distance is mostly even; there’s no head-hopping, but interiority remains somewhat shallow and summary-like. Overall, the voice is pleasant and legible, if not yet distinctive at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent mythic-register third-person that suits the material: phrases like “numbers that never fell” and “ink a luminous algae that faded only when read” feel controlled, not random. Patterned diction around tides, breath, song, and webs is clearly intentional and held through the ending. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance stays stable at an external-lyric remove. At times the uniform loftiness risks smoothing out emotional texture, but it never breaks control.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well matched to the material, with a strong perceptual signature in its mingling of workaday detail and numinous phenomena. Syntax and diction feel controlled and deliberate, with no POV leakage or confusing shifts in stance. Recurrent phrases (“gleaming silence,” “pockets of gravity”) read as intentional motifs rather than tics. The voice maintains clarity even while operating in a high-metaphor, slightly surreal register.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to the ritualistic subject; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. Recurrent phrasing (“smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze”) feels intentional rather than purely repetitive, building a spell-like cadence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator’s certainty matches what’s observable. The main limit is that the voice, while pretty, flattens under pressure—its tonal uniformity leaves little modulation as stakes supposedly rise.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly biased toward noticing textures of stone, light, and gesture; this perceptual signature feels owned by the narrator. Diction is elevated but coherent with a reflective, slightly romantic mind, and Liora’s presence is filtered convincingly through that lens. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and psychic distance stays appropriately close. At times the register borders on ornate, but it maintains control and doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confidently lyrical, with a consistent register of elevated, imagistic diction. Motifs like “ghostly resolve,” “tragically radiant,” and “resonance structures” create a recognizable texture across the piece. At times, the lexicon (“resonance structures,” “symbolic alchemy”) drifts toward pseudo-technical abstraction that feels more authorial than character-specific, weakening the perceptual signature. Still, POV control is clean and the cadence generally suits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Liora’s sensibility; phrases like “a crystal-clear vow to forever cherish the unfinished and the forged alike” fit the meditative, ceremonial tone. Diction and syntax are consistent and confident, with patterned images (light, stone, water) reinforcing a unified narrative stance. At times the register pushes toward abstraction and repetition (“calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring”) in ways that feel slightly authorial rather than distinctly Liora’s inner language, which gently blurs the perceptual signature. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice is controlled enough for publication-level work with tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent and distinctive, with a strong auditory and atmospheric bias that fits the protagonist’s perception. Diction is elevated but stable, and the patterned phrases (humming, whispering, reed-blown melancholy) form a recognizable texture rather than random ornament. Psychic distance stays relatively close to her sensibility without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the abstractions (“universe’s secret hymn,” “webs of intrigue”) flirt with vagueness, but not enough to blur the narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a consistent lexicon (“borrowed starlight,” “dream-tide,” “liquid mirror”) that suits the mythic tone. Focalization stays close enough to the whisperer’s perceptions without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. Rhythm and sentence variety are generally strong, with some purposeful repetition that reads as incantatory rather than accidental. While the voice is elevated and somewhat uniform in register, it feels intentional and coherent for this piece.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to the contemplative subject, with some memorable turns (“each droplet a story of effort unseen”). The diction is elevated but broadly plausible for an omniscient-leaning narrator aligned with a philosopher’s gaze. However, reliance on similar constructions and repeated key phrases (“hidden patterns,” “demure audacity,” “moon paths,” “whispering parapet”) flattens rhythmic variety and can feel mannered. There is little modulation of distance or texture as the piece moves toward closure, so emotional intensity and sentence rhythm remain at one lush register.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and fits the slightly elevated, speculative tone of the setting. Diction and rhythm are generally smooth, and the narrative stance stays within what Mira can plausibly observe and infer. The perceptual signature—her attention to ink hue, paper grain, ozone—is promising but not pushed far enough to feel unmistakably individual. Overall the voice is solid and publishable but not yet distinctive or risky enough for a top-tier slot.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyric, and controlled, with a distinct texture in phrases like “gritty whimsy” and “smelled of oil and ozone.” The patterned diction (repeated use of “variant allegiance,” “ancient shadows,” “fragmented radio frequencies”) creates a consistent incantatory effect appropriate to the prophetic frame. POV stance is stable and omniscient-lyric without head-hopping; temporal compressions are smoothly handled. The risk is slight sameness of register across the whole piece, but it still reads as a deliberate stylistic choice rather than a lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a clear preference for sensory-rich, metaphor-heavy phrasing that matches the poet’s sensibility. The perceptual signature—attentive to sound, light, and the poetics of small objects—feels coherent throughout, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, diction trends uniformly elevated and ornate, which can blur distinctions between high points and quieter beats. Still, the voice is recognizable and controlled enough to sustain the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, melding technical diction (frequencies, spectrometer, amplitude) with sensuous, almost musical description in a way that feels like Elara’s mind. Rhythm varies nicely between long, lush sentences and shorter, firmer beats at key turns, and there is no POV slippage or expository over-explaining. Some metaphors verge on purple, but they maintain an identifiable texture rather than feeling generic. The voice feels controlled and distinctive, well-suited to the story’s blend of engineering and mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, ritualistic frame. Diction such as “restrained wildness,” “softly purposeful,” and “magnetic viaduct after rain” gives the piece a distinct texture without major register slips. Rhythm is controlled, with long, flowing sentences matching the slow, patient mood and occasional shorter lines landing key realizations. Some phrasal repetition nudges toward pattern rather than artifact, mostly supporting tone.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The first-person voice is stable, syntactically competent, and occasionally striking in its figurative choices. Still, the diction often reads like generalized elevated lyricism rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature for this specific investigator. Recurrent phrasing (“reverberate,” “controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) can feel thematic more than character-specific. POV control is clean, but the voice lacks the idiosyncratic edge that would mark it as immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and gently lyrical, with a consistent register that suits a reflective chaplain. Repeated phrasing (“vibrant hush,” “By the way light breaks through storm clouds”) creates a pattern, though it sometimes feels like a visible device rather than an organic thought-rhythm. The shopkeeper’s few quoted lines are differentiated enough in role and tone, even if not deeply idiosyncratic. Overall, the voice is pleasant and coherent but not yet distinctive at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, playful, and consistently colored by whimsical techno-mysticism (“a joke only the universe giggled at”). POV is stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The diction and rhythm are distinctive, though at times the ornate metaphors risk feeling more like authorial flourish than strictly Mara-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to an archivist protagonist moving through haunted digital spaces. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases building a coherent tonal fabric without major register slips. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how the narrator notices songs, patches, and data as quasi-sacred artifacts. The voice could push further into idiosyncrasy or tension under peak beats, but it’s already polished and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close/limited voice is consistent and comfortably lyrical, with controlled syntax and a recognizable cadence. Phrasing like “shadow-laced peacekeeper” and “courageous anomaly” signals a deliberate, somewhat incantatory register that the story maintains. At times, the diction leans into abstraction (“map empathy onto action,” “unspoken hopes”) in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, flattening the perceptual signature. Still, there is no POV leakage or technical instability, and the rhythm generally supports the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is steady, lyrical, and recognizably singular, with recurring stylistic preferences (wind and breath metaphors, quiet personifications) that form a coherent signature. Diction is elevated but generally plausible for a highly reflective narrator, and psychic distance stays consistent. There is some redundancy in phrasing and a few lines feel like thematic essay rather than lived perception, but they don’t break POV. Overall, the voice is polished and distinctive enough for serious markets, though it could benefit from a touch more textural variety and grit.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and recognizably lyric, with recurring phrases like “gently persuasive” and “passionate subtlety” giving it a distinct if somewhat mannered texture. At times the diction drifts into abstract or academic register (“intersubjective understanding,” “motivation to nurture”), which clashes with the otherwise sensuous, earthbound imagery. There’s control in rhythm and syntax, but the repetition of key phrases begins to feel like a tic rather than intentional patterning. Overall, the POV is clear and consistent, but not yet sharpened into a truly singular, pressure-responsive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and lyrically textured, with recurring idiosyncratic phrases (“whisperfield calm,” “peripheral awareness”) that feel intentional. POV distance is consistent; we hover close enough to follow the Keeper’s role without slipping into omniscient commentary about others’ inner lives. Rhythm varies decently, and the diction suits a mystical, contemplative fable. At times, the uniform hush of the voice flattens emotional contour and could use sharper modulation under key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and fits the meditative, ritualistic frame; the diction (“subtle puzzle archivist,” “collective pulse steadier”) is consistent and character-appropriate. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from quiet preparation to communal ceremony is smooth. Some lines feel generically poetic rather than idiosyncratically Mara’s, which keeps the voice from reading unmistakably singular at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person, close-to-Mara voice is steady and confident, with lyrical yet controlled diction and no POV slippage. Phrases like “testify through the crystal” and “sonically reflective shards of light” signal a distinct, slightly elevated narrative texture. There is occasional drift toward purple or over-weighted modifiers, but not enough to impair clarity. Rhythm varies reasonably and supports the meditative, accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong auditory and tidal lexicon that clearly belongs to this consciousness. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, modulating between longer, rolling sentences and quieter cadences, especially near the ending. There are no POV slips or register clashes, and the narrative modestly stays within what this prophet could plausibly sense and imagine. At times the voice risks sameness of tone, but it remains distinctive and capable of carrying the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the material, with a controlled cadence of long, flowing sentences and carefully placed shorter emphatic lines. Diction (“luminous ache,” “whisper of the universe’s own yearning”) is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic perspective and never contradicts the implied POV’s competence. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is stable, gliding between close observation of tools and sweeping cosmic reflection. A touch more variation in rhythm or a few sharper, plainer counters to the lushness could make the voice even more striking.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close-third/omniscient-leaning voice is stable and confidently lyrical, with a consistent register throughout. However, the diction leans into generalized “poetic” phrasing (e.g., “scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”) rather than a more idiosyncratic, character-specific perception. There’s limited modulation of voice or distance as pressure rises; the narration feels tonally uniform from first line to last. The result is smooth but somewhat generic in texture for a piece aiming at top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-but-composed voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, mythic tone. Diction is controlled and mostly free of register slips, with a clear perceptual focus on runes, machinery, and light. However, the voice lacks a strongly idiosyncratic edge or deep interior coloration, reading more as competent high-fantasy narration than as a singular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a consistent lyric texture and a recognizable perceptual signature (medical precision mingled with cosmic metaphor). Diction leans elevated but feels intentional and coherent with Mara’s reflective, quasi-philosophical stance. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the rhythmic modulation from garden scene to study sequence works well. The main drawback is some sameness of register—always lush, rarely roughened under stress—which slightly flattens dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct texture built from repeated motifs (mist, glass, zephyr, constellations). Diction and rhythm are controlled and fitting for a contemplative, quasi-mythic register. At times, repetition of coined phrases (“reflectively vibrant,” “zephyr bloom”) flattens into mannerism, but overall the perceptual lens stays stable. There’s no POV slippage, and the stance remains appropriate to an accumulative, meditative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical, imagistic texture that matches Lira’s watchful, dreamlike mindset. Diction is mostly consistent and character-coherent; phrases like “honeyed hush” and “protected vulnerability” feel slightly workshop-signaled but still integrated into the piece’s sensibility. Rhythm varies effectively, and the narrative stance never leaks into expository lecturing or head-hopping. The lyric mode is well-taught early and maintained through closure without obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person lyric voice is steady and controlled, with a coherent contemplative distance and no POV slippage. Diction and rhythm are largely consistent, and the “lucidly watchful” gaze informs what is noticed (flickers, cameos, margins). However, the prose sometimes lapses into generalized poeticism (“a mosaic built against the current of conventional narratives”) that could belong to many narrators. The lack of modulation undercuts distinctiveness, keeping the voice competent rather than unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly elevated diction that suits a mythic/ritual frame. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narration maintains a stable psychic distance, weaving Mara’s perceptions with external description smoothly. Patterned phrases (e.g., recurring “gathering hush,” “forgotten songs”) read as deliberate motifs rather than artifacts. There is no dialogue to test, but internal and narrative voices are coherent and well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly attuned to craft, slowness, and light; diction and syntax are consistent with that sensibility. Recurrent phrases like “moving stillness” and “safekept starlight” build a clear sonic pattern without becoming incoherent. The narrative distance stays steady, with controlled, gently rhythmic sentences that suit the meditative mode. It doesn’t quite reach an unmistakably singular, riskier voice, but it is already publication-ready in control.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with Corin’s reflective nature, with repeated attention to light, angles, and echoes as a kind of perceptual signature. Diction is elevated but generally controlled and coherent, with few lapses in register or clumsy constructions. The narrative stance remains stable and confident, and the slight distance from Corin supports the fable-like tone. At times the lyricism flattens modulation—nearly every beat is equally hushed and ornate—which slightly reduces the dynamic range of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush,” “string of midnight”) that makes the piece recognizable. The POV distance is stable, giving us enough of the weaver’s perceptions without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Rhythms generally suit the meditative, ritual mode, with long, flowing sentences that match the dreamlike tempo. At times the density of coined phrases risks self-consciousness, but it rarely undermines clarity or the chosen reverie-like stance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly colored by Mara’s sensibility, with a strong circus-inflected perceptual signature (roars, manes, tails, applause). Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative mode, and there’s no POV slippage or unjustified omniscience. At times, the diction drifts into abstract, thesis-like phrasing that slightly distances us from her embodied experience. Overall, the voice is distinctive and confident but flirts with a reflective-register that occasionally feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture, with images like “kinetic lagoon,” “carousel of ancient gears,” and “quilt of regrets” creating a distinct perceptual signature. POV control is steady, staying inside Mara’s sensibility without unmotivated omniscient drift, and the brief bits of dialogue feel in keeping with the mythic, heightened register. At times the diction leans toward uniformly elevated, which can slightly flatten modulation under emotional pressure, but it remains legible and intentional. Overall, the voice feels coherent and confident enough for publication with minimal refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a clear tilt toward conceptual, metaphor-rich description that fits a reflective engineer in a deserted terminal. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled, and there’s no POV leakage. Still, the voice leans into generalized abstractions (“lattice of intention pathways,” “maze of intentions resolved into order”) that feel more like authorial essaying than this specific intern’s idiolect. The texture is competent and occasionally striking, but not yet singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and distinctively lyrical, with a consistent preoccupation with time, silence, and sensory nuance that fits an introverted clock scribe. Recurrent phrasing (“excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia”) creates a recognizable texture and supports the accumulative mode. However, the repeated key terms start to feel like prompt artifacts rather than fully organic diction, and a few metaphors (“bear of possibilities”) strain naturalness. Still, the POV control is clean and the narrative stance steady.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person, gently elevated voice is consistent and well-suited to the contemplative, mythic tone. Lexicon and rhythm are generally controlled, with some pleasing cadences and image clusters (twilight, radio hum, water, sundial). Repetition of certain phrases (“serene upheaval,” “hindsight clarity,” “architecture of lies”) edges toward pattern rather than accident, but occasionally feels a bit formulaic. Overall, the POV handling is clean and the narrative stance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“fog rolled across the water like a breath held by the sea itself,” “each knot whispered a pulse”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and suit the meditative, oceanic mood; psychic distance is stable and appropriate. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and patterned phrases (e.g., repetitions of hush and patience) feel like deliberate texture rather than scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a consistent elevated register that suits the fable-like premise. Repeated formulations (“intimate projection,” “geography of healing”) show a bit of patterning but not outright scaffolding or head-hopping. Rhythm and diction are controlled enough that the piece reads as intentional, distinctive prose rather than generic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, confidently lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic-steampunk setting, with consistent diction and rhythm. Imagery like “his voice trembling like a violin string about to snap” and “song of wind” demonstrates a distinct, cohesive texture. At times the narrative stance feels more omniscient/authorial than character-filtered, slightly blurring the prince’s specific perceptual signature. The lyric register is sustained but modulates only mildly with pressure, which keeps the voice from fully sharpening at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and distinct, with recurring turns of phrase (“kelp-drift peace,” “gracefully alert”) and a consistent mythic register. Focalization stays close to Mira’s perceptions even as it occasionally broadens to encompass clouds and villagers in a quasi-omniscient sweep, but the shifts feel intentional rather than sloppy. Rhythms are well modulated, with longer, lusher sentences suited to the contemplative mode, and no dialogue issues arise. At times the elevated diction flirts with generic spiritual language, but overall the voice feels coherent and deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyric third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic sentences and recurring motifs (light, hush, constellations). Diction is elevated but mostly appropriate to the fable-like, mythic register. Occasional phrasing awkwardness (“could be unstick only”) and density of ornament approach purple in places, but do not break POV or clarity. There’s a distinct narrative texture, if not an especially idiosyncratic one.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled elevated diction and a clear perceptual signature focused on cosmic, emotional textures rather than concrete action. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and recurring constructions (“troubling serenity,” “quiet sigh,” “sonar pinging”) feel like intentional motifs rather than tics. The narrative stance stays stable—no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in knowledge—and the voice modulates gently as pressure rises toward the revelation of past wars. At times, abstraction slightly distances us from her body and immediate sensations, but it suits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a clear lyrical texture (“the greenhouse…breathed a slow, humid sigh”) that suits the contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the narrative stance hovers close enough to Eliam to feel filtered without slipping into omniscient explanation. No POV breaches or awkward distance shifts undercut the reading. The voice could be marginally more individuated to Eliam rather than generally poetic, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a strong, consistent lyrical texture and a distinct fondness for metaphor and rhythmic clauses. Diction and register fit the quasi-mythic tone of the piece and seldom break stance. There is good control of cadence between long, incantatory sentences and shorter emphatic ones, especially around the pendulum’s pause and resumption. The main limitation is a sameness of elevated, reverent mood that flattens modulation across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently omniscient yet close to the gardener’s sensibility, with a consistent lyrical texture and recurring lexical motifs (velveteen gloom, echoes, humming). Diction is elevated but coherent with the fable-like tone, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, though at times the prose leans into similar cadences and lush constructions. Overall, the voice is distinct and controlled, if occasionally more ornate than the stakes warrant.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctively elevated, slightly scientific-mythic register (“predictive modeling,” “laboratory of possibility”) that suits the premise. Diction and rhythm show control, with lush but generally clear sentences and no POV slippage. The narrative stance occasionally drifts into expository summary, but it remains coherent and purposeful rather than mechanical. Overall, the voice feels unified and confident, even if it prioritizes concept over intimate psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and image-driven, with a distinct lexicon of dust, mist, embers, and glow. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Recurrent phrasing (“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous”) approaches mannerism but also builds a recognizable texture. The voice is strong and controlled, though its uniform hush slightly flattens dynamics around key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person, lyric voice is consistent and suitably focused on sensory and symbolic detail, giving the piece a clear stylistic identity. The diction largely fits the heightened, surreal mode and avoids obvious register clashes. There are a few clunky constructions (“to weaves truth carefully,” tense slips) and some repetitive phrasing that slightly dulls the effect. Still, point of view control is steady, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct and consistent: intellectually self-conscious, slightly sardonic (“wannabe philosopher,” “rationally rebellious”), and colored by the technicality of waterworks. Diction and rhythm mostly match a reflective, educated loner in a ruined, semi-fantastical world, and the “abrasive calm” stance feels coherent. There’s good control of distance—the narrative is close enough to feel personal but not overwrought. A few abstract, essayish lines sand some edges off the voice, but not enough to break its integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a consistent texture of metaphor and elevated diction that matches the premise of an artist-teacher in a hushed library. Patterns like “traveled stillness” and “across unlearning hatred” establish a recognizable idiom rather than random flourishes. At times the language feels more like an abstract narrator than the specific mind of this teacher, slightly distancing us from her embodied viewpoint. Still, POV control is clean and rhythmically competent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with consistent third-person close focus through Mara and a sensory bias that suits a chef who reads the world via taste and scent. Diction such as “synaptic plasticity” and “invisible gears” stays coherent with the quasi-scientific/mystical register established early. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and key sentences land with cadence appropriate to their importance. The control is high, though the uniform lyricism sometimes smooths over what might have been sharper emotional or tonal modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and tone. Syntax and rhythm are varied and largely well-controlled, and the narrative distance stays appropriate for a close, almost fable-like mode. There’s a distinct texture to phrases like “electric nectar” and “honey from the sky,” which fits the story’s world. At times the lyricism edges toward uniformity of register, but it does not break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, sensuous, and clearly marked by an observant, metaphor-prone mind; the “creeping normality noticer” angle feels owned in diction and perception. Rhythm varies well enough to avoid monotony, and the lyric compression is taught early and sustained. The brief direct-speech moment with the shopkeeper and the elderly woman fits the established register and doesn’t disturb focalization. At times the elevated, image-heavy narration risks smoothing emotional edges, but control of distance and stance remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    The omniscient, lyric voice is consistent, with controlled syntax and a recognizable cadence of long, image-rich sentences. Diction generally suits a mythic, underwater fable and avoids jarring register shifts. That said, the narration is so uniform and elevated that it flattens potential modulation in intensity; everything is equally ornate whether we’re in “revelation” or “lullaby.” The lack of sharper rhythmic contrast or tighter psychic distance undercuts some potential impact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent and comfortably distant, with a controlled, mildly elevated lyric register that suits the conceptual focus. Phrasing like “balancedly daring mathematics” and “boundless confinement” creates a recognizable texture, and patterns (dice, stairs, motion) are handled with decent rhythm. However, the voice leans heavily on abstraction and repetition instead of modulating toward more immediate, sensory language at emotional peaks, which keeps it from feeling fully alive. There’s no POV slippage or confusion, but also limited distinctiveness at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable and distinctive, with a controlled, imagistic rhythm that suits the dreamy premise. The shift to Jiro is clearly marked and maintains the same narrative distance without head-hopping or confusion. Diction is elevated and consistent with the story’s fable-like register; it rarely lapses into flat explanation. At times the uniform lushness risks sameness, but overall the voice feels confident and deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with recurring images (rosewater, emerald light, honeyed sorrow) creating a distinct texture that suits the mythic register. POV is stable and external-omniscient but filtered closely through Liora’s concerns; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction veers toward uniform lushness, so modulation between pressure and release is more rhythmic than tonal. Even so, the voice feels coherent and controlled across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with recurring phrasing (“bleak exhilaration,” “latent radiance”) giving it a recognizable texture. Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. At times the diction feels slightly generalized for such a specialized character—less like a specific mind and more like an atmospheric narrator. Still, the voice is controlled and coherent enough for high-level markets.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is stable and confidently gothic, with a consistent lexicon of rot, light, and corruption that suits the material. Diction sometimes verges on self-conscious (“repulsive allure,” “slithering susurrus”) and key phrases recur so often they feel more like constraint-satisfying than organic thought, but the rhythm generally supports mood. POV distance is a bit cool for such high-stakes, intimate horror, yet it never breaks or leaks into head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but in-character for the advisor’s role as a cryptic tempter.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, musical premise, with phrases like “restless euphony” and “sketched resonance” giving it a distinctive texture. Psychic distance holds steady in a slightly elevated, fable-like register without head-hopping or jarring shifts. The modulation from growing intensity to soft denouement is smooth, even if the emotional palette remains relatively narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently patterned, with a clear fascination for spirals, patterns, and light that matches Mira’s worldview. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent, creating a distinct tonal signature without noticeable head-hopping or stance confusion. Psychic distance remains in a close-to-middle band, slipping into her priorities more than her verbatim thoughts, which suits the mythic atmosphere. At times the register edges toward generalized poeticism over sharply personal idiom, which keeps it slightly below elite-tier distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a mildly elevated, reflective register that suits a historian focalizer. Diction and syntax are generally controlled, and the narrative stance remains consistent without head-hopping. At times the voice drifts toward essayistic abstraction, especially in the theme-heavy reflections, which slightly flattens immediacy. Still, the perceptual signature—metaphorical, archival, historically minded—is distinct enough to work.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close POV is stable and the narrative diction is consistently lyrical in a way that fits Mara’s sensibility as a surveyor attuned to ruins. Phrasing like “turning the air into a hushed blaze of damp copper” creates a distinctive texture and perceptual signature. At times the register and metaphor frequency risk feeling more authorial-poetic than character-grounded, but not enough to break voice coherence. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and suitable for a meticulous archivist; diction like “logical page indexer” and “alternative hypothesis” fits her mindset. The narrative distance stays consistent, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. However, the voice, while polished, feels like a generalized literary register rather than a sharply idiosyncratic consciousness—Mara’s perceptions do not yet sound unmistakably hers. This limits memorability at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong, almost incantatory rhythm that suits the fantastical tone. Diction and syntax are controlled, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping; the narrative distance remains stable. However, the heightened, uniformly ornate register can blur individual emotional spikes, as nearly every sentence reaches for lyricism rather than modulating intensity. The effect is distinctive but would benefit from a few sharper, plainer strokes at key pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with consistent elevated diction that fits a scientifically literate, grief-stricken observer, and the perturbation-theory lexicon feels integrated rather than expository. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep the lyric mode from going totally monotone, and the inner lens never leaks into other POVs. Still, certain repeated phrases (“intangibly tangible,” “unfiltered awakening”) and stacked abstractions occasionally read as authorial rather than truly character-bound. For a prestigious venue, some modulation toward more character-specific idiosyncrasy and less slogan-like repetition would be expected.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and suits the lyric, quasi-mystical tone of the piece. POV sticks cleanly with Lira’s experience, though the narration’s diction often feels more like an authorial overlay than her distinct mental texture. Rhythm is generally controlled, if occasionally lush enough to blur character-specific perception. Overall, the voice is pleasant and competent but not yet singular or character-particular enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent in diction and perspective; phrases like “sieved hush” and “a genealogy of guilt” feel distinct to this narrator. Psychic distance is stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the high-register, metaphor-heavy narration slightly outpaces what a person under real moral stress might indulge in, softening immediacy. Still, the voice is controlled enough to feel intentional rather than generically ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably hushed, with rhythmic, often lyrical sentences that match the somber mood. Diction is slightly elevated but fits the reflective negotiator; POV boundaries are clean with no head-hopping. Some repeated formulations (“furrowed hush,” reiterated mentions of the antique drawer pull) verge on mannered but don’t collapse distinctiveness. The prose modulates gently with shifts in pressure, though it rarely sharpens into a more urgent or fractured cadence at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and lyrical, with a coherent navigation- and sky-inflected perceptual signature that fits the character. Diction is elevated but mostly controlled, giving the piece a mythic, contemplative tone that aligns with its introspective focus. At times, the voice leans on familiar formulations (“liquid glass,” “pen across paper, drafting a narrative of redemption”), which slightly dilutes its distinctiveness. Still, POV control is clean and modulation from sorrow to quiet resolve is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice has a consistent, mildly noir-lyric texture (“jaded wonder,” “cathedral of algae”) that fits the premise. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly character-plausible, and the speculative elements are filtered through a recognizable, human sensibility. Some phrases feel slightly generic or slogan-like, but there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. Overall, the POV is stable and distinct enough to carry the accumulative, reflective mode without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person, lyrical voice is consistent and confident, with recurring images (“silvered,” “moon‑woven,” “filament”) tying the piece together. The narrative distance stays stable and appropriate for a mythic, fairy-tale mode, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some diction choices (“cosmos contracted,” “phoenix’s eternal ascent”) lean generic-cosmic, diluting the distinctiveness of Liora’s specific perceptual signature. Overall, though, the voice feels controlled and unified with the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, with a consistent elevated register and a strong sensory palette (“choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet,” “dew on spider silk”). Focalization is stable and there’s no head-hopping; we remain in or very close to the cartomancer’s sensibility, even when the narration zooms out. Rhythmic variation is solid though occasionally prone to similarly cadenced, heavily modified sentences that blur edges. Overall, the voice feels intentional and distinctive, well-suited to an accumulative, ritualistic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent and confident, with evocative phrases like “cracked like a sunrise on a blackened sea” and “museum of memories where time slipped like dust on glass.” POV stance is stable and appropriate to the mythic tone; there’s no head-hopping or jarring register shifts. Some metaphors are familiar and occasionally stack, but they don’t obscure meaning or rhythm. The perceptual signature is more cosmic-omniscient than character-particular, yet it suits the piece’s aspirations.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, with a clear preference for mystical, rhythmic description that suits the material. POV distance and access remain stable around Mara, and there is no disruptive head-hopping. At times, the diction veers into generalized mystic register (“vibrant hush,” “universe had arranged this coincidence”) that feels more authorial than character-specific, flattening her perceptual signature. Rhythm is pleasant but somewhat uniform, with few modulations in syntax to track shifts in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrically consistent, and confident, with a clear preference for luminous, slightly heightened diction that matches the fable-like premise. POV is effectively single-lens even when it zooms out to the whole garrison, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. Rhythms and word choices feel intentional, though at times the lushness risks sameness of register across all beats. The piece maintains its chosen voice under closure without strain, earning a solid high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lush, and confidently handles elevated diction suited to a mythic, cosmic frame. Selene’s perceptions are filtered through a ritualistic, pattern-obsessed lens (Fibonacci spirals, ratios, harmonics), giving the narration a distinct texture. The rhythmic prose maintains a steady, incantatory tone, though it can feel somewhat uniform in cadence and emotional register. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance stays appropriate to the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyrical texture (“furiously tranquil,” “storm’s teeth,” “cartography of scars”). Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled for this mode, maintaining a steady, incantatory feel that suits the ritual frame. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion that breaks stance. The main limitation is some reliance on repeated constructions and abstract diction that keeps voice from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to the allegorical feel, with some pleasing rhythmic control (“a lecture without a lectern”). The perceptual stance remains consistent and avoids head-hopping despite its somewhat omniscient flavor. That said, the diction is generically lyrical at times, with repeated formulations that blur into pattern rather than character-specific texture. The voice feels competent and pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, confidently lyrical, and maintains a consistent distance; it reads like an omniscient narrator loosely aligned with Lira. Word choice and rhythm are deliberate, with strong recurring images and a recognizable tonal palette. Dialogue is brief but in character, and it advances the central concept (Rook’s “What rebellion hides in a cup?” is a good example of voice doing thematic work). Occasionally the register edges toward generalized poetic abstraction, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with a clear stylistic signature (compressed metaphors, dream-logic causality). Psychic distance is steady; we never slip into other POVs. Rhythm and diction are controlled, even if occasionally bordering on ornamental. The voice feels suited to the surreal material and maintains coherence through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a measured, lyrical cadence that matches Mara’s analytical yet imaginative mind. Diction and syntax are controlled, and the narrative confidently inhabits its mythic-scientific register without head-hopping or stance confusion. The perceptual signature—treating dreams, weather, and plants as data to be mapped—is memorable. Occasional abstraction nudges the prose toward uniform elevation, but not enough to damage distance control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent and confident, with a strong perceptual signature built around tides, lace, and slow cadence that fits the tutor. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, and shifts in intensity (the compass quivering, the glow spreading) are handled smoothly without POV leakage. However, the elevated diction and recurring patterns sometimes blur into sameness, dampening contrast between key beats. A bit more modulation or abrasion in the voice at turning points would sharpen its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is too distant, summarizing internal states ("Mara believed," "She recalled") via filter verbs instead of immersing the reader in immediate experience. The voice drifts into explanatory tones that explain meaning rather than allowing it to emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but marred by "committee voice" poeticism and forced phrasing that distances the reader from immediate action. The insertion of the phrase "steadily adaptive" is jarring and disrupts the internal rhythm, reading as a constraint compliance rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, though it occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("trembling like a lighthouse beam"). The tone is cohesive but lacks modulation, maintaining a single meditative note throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distanced, filtering the gritty reality of the task through a layer of poetic abstraction. The psychic distance is too great to feel the protagonist's immediate physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and fable-like, heavily relying on filter verbs ("Mara understood," "felt," "knew") that create an unnecessary layer between the reader and the action. This summarization creates a "told" quality that muffles the urgency of the sanction crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but suffers from excessive sentimentality that distances the reader. The "we" of the narration feels intrusive in its eagerness to impart wisdom rather than show experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from heavy "purple prose" that distances the reader. The tone feels artificially elevated ("whispered... like secret prayers," "pulsing like captured sunrise"), creating a layer of poetic obfuscation that flattens the emotional distinctness of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is overwrought and melodramatic, relying on "purple" descriptors ("thrum with possibility," "sleeping hearts") that distance the reader. The tone lacks control, oscillating between gritty dystopian setup and fairy-tale resolution without a consistent narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly reliant on elevated, poetic diction that creates distance from the immediate physical reality. The narrative filter feels more like an omniscient aesthetic description than a grounded POV experiencing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly poetic, relying on a "whispers and destiny" register that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality. There is little variance in tone between the narration and the minimal interaction. The POV acts as a camera for visuals rather than a distinct consciousness under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, utilizing high-register "poetic" diction ("labor into liturgy") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality. The narration often slips into an explanatory mode, telling the reader what symbols mean rather than letting them exist as images.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.3)
    The voice is melodramatic and overwrought, relying on mixed metaphors ("heart... trembling drum," "betrayal... second skin") that distance the reader. The tone attempts a poetic elevation that clashes with the mechanical plot insertions, resulting in an artificial and unconvincing narrative persona.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a mythic tone but collapses under the weight of repetitive phrasing and purple prose. The constant reuse of "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" creates a robotic, algorithmic cadence that breaks immersion and distracts from the intended atmospheric gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("realized," "felt," "noting") that buffer the reader from immediate experience. While the tone attempts a poetic register, it often slips into generic abstraction ("universe had offered it a simple, honest invitation") rather than distinct, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.5)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but leans heavily into sentimental abstraction ("thoughts folded like origami," "rain-kissed"). While the tone is unified, the reliance on high-minded generalizations distances the reader from any grounded emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from excessive filtering ("he felt," "he sensed," "seemed to"), creating distance between the reader and the immediate experience. The tone is overly elevated and poetic, often drifting into abstraction at the expense of grounding the character's specific perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is distant and overly ornate, prioritizing poetic posturing over narrative immediacy. The prose filters the experience through a layer of interpretation—telling the reader things are "profound" or "paradoxical"—instead of trusting the action to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a steady, reverent tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("trembling like breath," "caress carve"), calling attention to the writing rather than the moment. The POV remains stable, though it filters the world through a lens of romanticized awe.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a lyrical, melancholic tone. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("lights flickering like hesitant thoughts," "sing an auroral sorrow"), creating a density that slows the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct but suffers from significant repetition of specific phrases ("drowsy alertness," "swallowed truth," "factory ghost shift") that disrupts immersion. The tone is consistent but overwrought, relying on a dense, adjectival register that distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but marred by repetitive labeling ("regenerative silence" appears four times) and heavy use of filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "understood"). The tone creates distance rather than intimacy, telling the reader the character's emotions rather than showing them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining every emotion and meaning to the reader. The tone is consistently sentimental, lacking the modulation or distance control required for high-stakes literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Voice control is marred by the repetitive use of the specific phrase "bronze quiet" (four times), which reads as a generated artifact rather than a stylistic choice. The tone is consistent but overly uniform, lacking modulation between the library scenes and the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, fable-like tone, but creates excessive psychic distance. The reliance on filtering events through a lens of "mystery" and "enigma" prevents intimacy with the character or the moment. The voice tells the reader what to feel ("inexplicable feeling," "profound") rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, veering into meta-commentary ("crafted his sermon through rhetorical devices") that disrupts the fictional frame. The tone is often purple and melodramatic ("rosary of reverberations," "dripped like honey"), lacking the control and distinctiveness required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into elevated, breathless lyricism ("shards of light," "luminous sound"). While distinct, the relentless poetic register distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene, prioritizing pretty phrasing over grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistently high-flown but overly melodramatic, relying on oxymorons and abstract grandeur that distances the reader. The heavy filtering of experience through "deep" language obscures the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone with a distinct texture ("yawned like a throat of stone"). However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Marin knew," "She felt") and abstract noun phrases creates a distancing effect that prevents deep immersion in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is marred by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("credibly curious," "layered tranquility") which disrupt the rhythm. The register is consistently elevated but leans into abstraction, telling the reader what to feel ("unseen expectation," "fragile hope") rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.8)
    Control slips significantly at the climax with an unmotivated tense shift ("Now, as the transformation completes... He uncorked"), breaking the narrative frame. The voice leans into "thesaurus-itis" with phrasings like "aromatically cautious" that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistently elevated but leans heavily into purple prose ("glistened like amber veins," "humming silhouettes"). This relentless poetic register creates a barrier to immediacy, drawing attention to the writing itself rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly poetic, relying on a generic "fable" tone that creates distance rather than intimacy. The perspective lacks a distinct "perceptual signature" beyond the high density of metaphors, resulting in a "committee voice" feel.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly distant and explanatory, relying on summary to convey the character's state. The repetition of specific phrases ("affectionate detachment") breaks immersion and highlights the artificiality of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overly sentimental and intrusive, frequently summarizing emotions with abstract labels ("cautious exuberance," "tender ripple") instead of grounding them in perception. The tone is static and sugary, lacking the distance control or distinct perceptual signature required for literary engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornate, lacking distinct perceptual signatures for the character. The narrative distance slips into omniscient summary to explain community feelings rather than staying grounded in Arlen's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently poetic but suffers from "overwriting," creating a distance that prevents intimacy with the character or the stakes. The tone remains reverent and breathless throughout, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish between moments of observation and moments of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distinctively "purple," creating a distance that prevents intimacy. The narrative uses a "storybook" filter ("hush that seemed to listen," "delicate dance") that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the feeling through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the robotic repetition of prompt phrases ("sapphire hush," "kindly methodical") as leitmotifs. This creates an artificial rhythm that feels like a checklist exercise rather than an organic perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is overly poetic and prone to purple prose ("smile bending like a willow branch"), creating a distance that prevents immersion. The POV filters everything through a lens of unearned wonder and scientific certainty, lacking the grit or distinct perceptual signature of a working nursery owner. The tone is monotonously reverent, missing the modulation required for dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "prompt-itis," forcing required phrases like "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" into sentences where they fit awkwardly. The tone leans toward purple prose ("endless parade of colors," "trembling note of hope") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly ornate, prioritizing poetic abstraction over character-specific perception. The shift to a summary perspective at the end breaks the scene's immediacy and emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the mythic mode, though it maintains a high psychic distance that precludes emotional intimacy. The prose rhythm is controlled, but the voice often slides into "prompt-ese," inserting required phrases with visible seams that disrupt the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose and "poetic" abstraction that distances the reader. There is a tendency toward over-description that slows momentum ("analytically artistic blend of precision and imagination"). The point of view drifts into omniscient summarization of the character's intent rather than staying grounded in her immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is overly interpretative, frequently telling the reader what Lira feels ("heart throbbed with curiosity") or what things mean ("small rebellion against the aloofness") rather than showing the experience. The distance feels author-imposed rather than character-inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and cliché ("lover's sigh," "chilled promise"). The register is elevated but often slides into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The use of "escondite" creates a jarring distraction in the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from high psychic distance and overwrought "writerly" phrasing ("seep into her marrow," "veins of gold"). The tone prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, though it suffers from a high level of psychic distance that keeps the reader at arm's length. The focus on poetic observation over immediate experience results in a "filter" effect, where the protagonist's perceptions are described to the reader rather than lived through the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice attempts a poetic register but is undermined by mechanical redundancy. The distinct "echo" pattern—repeating the end of one sentence at the start of the next verbatim—creates a robotic, stuttering rhythm that distances the reader and breaks the illusion of a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and overly interpretative, explaining emotions ("gloomy cheerfulness") instead of evoking them. Frequent use of filter verbs ("she felt," "she heard," "she imagined") creates distance and dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently telling the reader what to feel ("hopeful desperation") rather than evoking it through distinct perception. There is no unique "perceptual signature"; the voice reads like a standard fable summary.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a melodramatic, overwrought tone that distances the reader. The reliance on poetic clichés ("heartbeat of the universe," "breath of the world") obscures the protagonist's specific perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.6)
    POV control fails significantly. While staying close to Mara ("Mara felt"), the narration describes visual phenomena she cannot perceive ("glistened," "shimmering beams"), creating a jarring disconnect between the voice and the character’s lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on filter verbs ("Mara felt," "she knew," "she sensed") which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The tone creates a barrier to intimacy, describing emotions instead of evoking them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice aims for a mythic tone but slips into "purple prose" with an over-reliance on adjectives and adverbs ("wild hush," "mute witnesses," "infinitely patient"). The consistent grandeur flattens the emotional variance, making the tone monotonous and distantly observational.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.8)
    Voice is marred by grammatical errors resulting from forced prompt insertion ("seemed to touches memories," "scent immediately unsnarl"). The narrative distance fluctuates between immediate sensory details and abstract, lofty summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.5)
    A jarring point-of-view break occurs when the prompt instruction "your own story" is integrated into the third-person narrative. The voice is consistently overwritten, prioritizing ornamental rhythm over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant and overly poetic, maintaining a "legend-telling" remove that prevents emotional intimacy. The tone is uniform throughout, lacking the modulation required to build tension or distinguish narrative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly poetic and repetitive, relying on a limited set of descriptors ("luminous," "soft," "orchid"). The perspective remains distant, describing the weaver's actions with a fable-like detachment that prevents intimacy or distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice adopts a distant, fable-like tone that filters immediate experience through summary and abstraction ("feeling the weight of generations"). There is an overreliance on filter verbs ("Mara felt," "She remembered") that distances the reader from the sensory reality of the scene. The tone is consistent but overly saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reverent and breathless, creating a distance that prevents intimacy with the character's immediate experience. The tone is cohesive but lacks the textural variance to distinguish the character's internal state from the narrator's descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and distanced, relying on "was known as" and "motive was simple" summaries. There is a lack of immediacy, with the narrator explaining the meaning of symbols rather than allowing the reader to experience them.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, oscillating between flowery description and awkward, prompt-forced phrasing ("messages in condensation on windows"). The reliance on abstract nouns and passive constructions distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and heavily filtered ("she felt," "she knew"), distancing the reader with high-flown abstraction. The use of "lotus-hearted ache" and similar phrases feels like forced poeticism that obscures the POV's actual sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and overwrought, relying heavily on filter verbs ("She believed," "She realized," "She sensed") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone vacillates between high-fantasy lyricism and awkward technical insertions ("photon-kissed," "knowledge network"), creating a disjointed texture. The POV creates no distinct perceptual signature beyond the delivery of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and tonally unified, fitting the magical realism genre. However, the breathless, wonder-struck tone limits dynamic range, and the interiority often feels like a vehicle for the author's thematic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative suffers from unmotivated head-hopping, shifting from Lysander’s perspective to Dr. Mirabel’s interior realization to resolve the plot. The narrative voice is consistent but overly flowery, prioritizing poetic signaling over distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but suffers from excessive distance and stylized affectation. It relies on "mischievous minnows" and "currents humming gently," creating a "committee voice" of generic whimsy. The POV filters everything through a lens of wonder that precludes genuine tension or grit.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, fable-like tone, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature unique to the character. The reliance on "poetic" filtering creates a layer of distance that keeps the reader observing the scene rather than inhabiting the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly reverent and prone to over-explaining the protagonist's internal state ("She knew that," "She felt"). The tone lacks distinct texture, defaulting to a generic high-fantasy register that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently purple and overly adjectival, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity. The repetition of specific, likely prompt-mandated phrases like "slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve" disrupts the narrative flow and feels artificial. The tone is monotonous in its reverence, lacking the modulation needed to create tension or distinct character voices.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly distant and reliant on poetic abstraction ("withering grace," "celestial lullaby"). The psychic distance prevents immediate engagement with the character's sensory reality or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice adopts a "high-literary" register that feels affected and overly poetic ("silent chords," "necessary distances"). While consistent, this voice prioritizes sounding profound over narrative clarity, creating a barrier between the reader and the character's immediate experience. The use of "featherly determined" as a serious descriptor disrupts the tonal credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical intent but suffers from a lack of control, drifting into purple prose that prioritizes sound over sense. The narrative distance is too close to the protagonist's uncritical awe, preventing the reader from experiencing the scene with any objectivity or grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but relies heavily on poetic clichés ("weep and smile," "humming a lullaby," "stardust"). The psychic distance is static; we observe Maren from a slight remove, told what she feels rather than inhabiting her perspective during the process of discovery. The tone feels manufactured by word choice rather than events.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly breathless and adjective-heavy ("orchestrated serendipity," "calculated wilderness"). There is also a lapse in POV discipline where the narrative head-hops into the collective internal experience of the audience ("The audience inhaled, feeling the tide's pulse sync...") to manufacture a reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic register but suffers from "purple" overwriting ("velvety black," "swallow time itself"). The narrative distance is remote, prioritizing poetic cadence over immediate character interiority. The tone is cohesive but static, lacking modulation during the ritual's supposed intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is overly affected and distant, prioritizing poetic abstraction over character-specific perception. The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("read between lines," "noctilucent") within a short space breaks immersion and makes the narrator sound mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but heavily affected, relying on a high-density "fable" register that feels artificial. The narrative distance is too great to allow for intimacy, and the tone feels like a stylistic exercise rather than an organic expression of character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like tone, though it suffers from distancing "filter" verbs ("Arin felt," "Arin noted"). The absence of dialogue and the reliance on summary prevents the scene from achieving immediacy. The perspective remains stable but feels detached, observing the events rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, filtering the experience through interpretation; "sensitively perceptive" is a redundant tag that weakens the POV's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffocated by a relentlessly elevated, poetic register that distances the reader from the action. The narrative stance serves as a "purple prose" generator, prioritizing aesthetic density over character-specific perception or emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice struggles under the weight of forced adverbs and adjectives ("operatively gentle," "fragile magnificence"). The tone is consistently elevated but artificial, prioritizing sounding "poetic" over clarity or emotional resonance. The narrator feels like an observer describing a pageant rather than a participant in a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains a heavy interpretive distance, filtering events through poetic abstraction ("bruised with the lull") instead of immediate sensory experience. The tone feels curated and self-conscious, prioritizing lyrical density over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-poetic register but suffers from distancing effects and abstraction. The tone creates a fable-like quality that keeps the reader at arm's length, preventing emotional intimacy with the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on filter verbs ("She remembered," "She imagined," "She saw") that distance the reader. The tone is overly poetic ("ember-kissed," "ribbons of starlight"), creating a barrier to immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly adjectival and relies on repetitive phrasing ("blushing stillness" appears three times). The tone remains at a single high pitch of reverence, lacking the modulation needed to make the emotional peaks land.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.8)
    A jarring POV slip ("After forgiving yourself... Mara felt") breaks the third-person frame with a dangling modifier. The narrative voice is consistently elevated but hollow, leaning into melodrama rather than grounded emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but suffers from repetitive phrasing and forced insertion of prompt terms. The clunky name "Foresight Hindsight Only" and the repeated, awkward use of "precisely playful" disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is distant, expository, and overly reliant on purple prose ("curiosity glowed like distant fire"). It functions as a "helpful narrator," explaining every emotion and significance to the reader rather than trusting the action to convey meaning. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the voice feels generic and detached.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative head-hops between Mara, Kovan, and the wanderer without distinct transitions or voice control. The tone is overly elevated and detached, creating a fable-like distance that prevents intimacy with the characters' experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical but maintains a high psychic distance that prevents emotional intimacy. The "legend-telling" tone creates a barrier, treating the events as a fait accompli rather than an unfolding crisis. The rhythmic control is adequate, but the register is monotonous in its poetic elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and fable-like, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. It relies on filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized") and explanatory interiority that interprets the scene for the reader instead of allowing the drama to unfold. The tone is consistently gentle, failing to modulate with the alleged "feisty" resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice adopts a consistent "fable" tone, but it is distant and overly elevated ("shimmered with whispers," "paradoxical family tree").

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a heavy, slightly purple high-fantasy register that distances the reader. The tone remains static throughout, treating the initial search and the final revelation with the same level of breathless reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly ornamental, prioritizing poetic flourish over character intimacy or distinct perception. The text suffers from "emotional ventriloquism," asserting feelings like "blissfully aberrant" or "pulse of hope" without grounding them in the protagonist's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overly detached, fable-like distance that tells emotions ("content," "warmth") rather than evoking them. The tone feels manufactured rather than arising from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical insertion of specific phrases required by the prompt, creating a robotic cadence. The reliance on full noun phrases for the character and objects, repeated verbatim, disrupts the natural flow of the prose and creates distance from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice suffers from register inconsistency, mixing poetic sentiment ("kiss the tarnished lantern") with clunky, pseudo-technical jargon ("retrocognitively blessed"). This tonal clash disrupts the intended atmosphere of reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on repetitive prompt-phrases ("preemptively nostalgic," "deepening hush") to establish tone. The register drifts into purple prose ("bruised violet," "chorus of distant recollections") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on filtering and uncertainty markers (five uses of "seemed" to describe setting and action), creating unmotivated psychic distance. The reliance on explanation ("his purpose was serious playfulness") undercut immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, mythic tone but settles into overwrought descriptiveness ("trembling stillness that begged for understanding"). The high density of adjectives and "poetic" phrasing creates a distance that muffles the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. However, it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with heavy adjectival stacking ("molten gold," "pastel light") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly precious, prioritizing abstract lyricism over clarity. The integration of required phrases is jarring, particularly the repetition of "train whistle’s echo," which feels inserted rather than organic to the narrator's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, summarizing emotions ("Mina's motivation burned bright") instead of dramatizing them. The tone is inconsistent, mixing high-fantasy register with clunky mechanical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent in its high, mythic register but creates a distancing effect that feels more like a fable summary than an immediate scene. The uniformly elevated tone flattens the emotional variance, treating every moment with the same breathless gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, though it leans toward "purple" descriptors ("steel heart," "dying star"). The tone matches the magical realism intent but sometimes distances the reader from the character's grit.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity or emotional authenticity. The repetition of the prompt phrase "eloquently silent" (four times) becomes a jarring verbal tic that draws attention to the writing rather than the story. The tone strains for significance with high-register diction that feels performed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly ornamental, struggling to maintain authority amidst awkward phrasing forced by prompt requirements. The shift in tense caused by the phrase "as reality shifts" disrupts the established past-tense narration. The voice prioritizes poetic posturing over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffocated by sentimentality and poetic abstraction ("bloom into meaning," "trembling like hope"). It tells the reader how to feel rather than trusting the dramatization, creating a distance that prevents genuine emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "head-hopping," drifting from Mara to the general populace and then to a new group in the epilogue, diluting the focalization. The tone is consistently elevated but overly flowery, creating a distance that prevents visceral engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a forced, overly poetic register that distances the reader. The narrative relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("quietly vivid," "vested hush") that feel like inserted keywords rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but trapped in a "fable" register that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience. The usage of prompt phrases like "mossy delight" feels forced and jarring within the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans into a detached, fable-like tone that prioritizes explanation over immersion. The reliance on clunky oxymorons like "uncertainly certain" feels forced and mannered rather than revealing a distinct character perspective.

    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and breathless ("thin as a sigh," "glint... seemed to pulse"), creating a layer of purple prose that distances the reader. The tone prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy lyricism but suffers from a lack of variation in rhythm and intensity.

The narrative relies on poetic assertion rather than grounded observation to convey authority.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is elevated but overwrought, relying on "purple prose" ("ultraviolet fire," "pewter mask strap") that creates distance. The insertion of clinical terms like "proprioceptively enhanced" clashes sharply with the mythic, poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distant, relying on abstraction ("negotiation with reality") that insulates the reader from the immediate moment. There is a lack of distinct perceptual grounding, replacing specific human observation with poetic generalization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, relying on "telling" ("She was poetically inclined") rather than immersion. The tone is consistent but reads like a fable or a prompt response rather than a literary narrative with controlled psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it leans heavily into a whimsical, fable-like register that borders on twee. The perspective stays firmly with Alder, but the narration often explains the significance of events rather than allowing the reader to infer meaning through the POV's perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is stable but maintains a uniform tone of breathless wonder ("slow, breathing sigh," "resonant hush") that flattens emotional variance. The consistent register prevents the pacing from accelerating effectively during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by an over-reliance on "art-speak" and abstract nouns. The distance is too great to feel Mira's immediate experience, and the repetitive sentence structures (frequently starting with "She [verb]") create a monotonous rhythm that deadens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent in its poetic, somewhat archaic register, but often slips into "helpful narrator" mode to explain the significance of events. The tone remains uniform throughout, lacking the modulation that accompanies rising tension. The perspective stays with Mara but filters her experience through a layer of interpretive abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.7)
    The voice suffers from distancing abstraction and elevated, purple phrasing ("relic of revolt," "parley of sand and sky") that acts as a barrier to intimacy. The omniscient summary style prevents any distinct perceptual signature or grounded voice from emerging; it reads like a fable or legend rather than a character-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like register that keeps the reader at arm's length. It leans heavily on abstract nouns ("intention," "civilization," "promise") rather than immediate, grounded perception, creating a "told" rather than "lived" experience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a "venerable scribe," maintaining a unified tone. However, the register remains relentlessly high, lacking the modulation needed to make the emotional beats feel intimate rather than performative.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice creates excessive distance through filter verbs ("she understood," "she recalled," "she perceived"). The register is consistently elevated but monotonous, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish high-pressure moments from reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent for the fable-like tone, though it maintains a high psychic distance that limits emotional engagement. The phrasing "credibly curious" disrupts the narrative texture, reading as an inserted prompt requirement rather than a natural descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated ("molten sunrise," "well of universal silence"), creating a distance that prevents intimacy with the character. The tone feels generic to the genre of "cosmic observation" and lacks a distinct perceptual signature unique to this specific janitor.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and detached, creating a fable-like distance that prevents emotional intimacy. The descriptor "astonished" contradicts the character's "tranquil" demeanor, leading to a confusing psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly flowery, relying on "purple" descriptors and a static, reverent tone that never modulates. The narration frequently tells the reader what to feel ("recognized... as a sign") rather than evoking the emotion through distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple prose," relying on breathless adjectival stacking ("luminous skeptic," "melodic echo," "bronze quiet resonance"). The tone maintains a high register that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene. POV is stable, though it frequently summarizes internal states rather than rendering them.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily filtered, relying on distance-creating constructions like "He understood that" and "He knew." This creates a "helpful narrator" effect that explains the significance of events (e.g., "the living translation of the dead tongues") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice relies on inflated diction ("intuitively descriptive keenness") that distances the reader from the protagonist's sensory experience. The POV logic is inconsistent, granting a canine character complex literacy and tool manipulation skills without establishing the rules for this ability.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    The POV fractures in the final paragraph, shifting from a solitary "I" ("blessed pariah," "only place left") to a collective "we" ("we once again sketched") without explanation, breaking narrative consistency. The voice is consistently overwrought, prioritizing poetic cadence over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a cloying, fable-like distance that prioritizes poetic sentiment over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.8)
    The POV is unstable, starting with first-person ("I arrived") before abandoning it for omniscient third-person focus on Mira. The voice is consistently elevated but leans into purple prose that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily overwritten, relying on breathless, elevated diction that feels like "writer voice" rather than character perspective.

The tone is melodramatic, prioritizing lyrical flow over distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is overwrought and leans on "purple prose," utilizing complex noun-adjective pairs that distance the reader. The reliance on filtering verbs and summary prevents a distinct, embodied POV from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overly adjectival and uniformly poetic ("hollow sigh," "silent cadence"), creating a manufactured distance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)

    The voice is consistent but overly poetic and strained ("fleeting architecture," "feathered attempt"). It leans heavily into "writerly" abstraction, creating a barrier to immersion rather than a distinct, lived-in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, relying on "purple" descriptors ("whispered silhouette," "silent promise") that distance the reader. The POV stays with Lena, but acts more like an omniscient explainer of her feelings than a close-third lens experiencing the world in real-time. It tells us she is mapping emotions rather than showing us the map.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but weighed down by "purple" descriptions and adjective stacking ("ebony shaft," "midnight transcriptions") that slow momentum. The tone strives for gravitas but often lands on melodrama, filtering the immediate action through layers of poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.7)

The tone is cohesive but risks becoming monotonous in its reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    The POV relies on heavy-handed exposition to justify traits ("Because I am spatially gifted, I could sense...") instead of showing them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly mediated, creating a distant, fable-like texture that prevents immersion. The narration is often "helpful," explaining the significance of events (e.g., the rumor chain mechanics) instead of allowing them to unfold through action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and unified, maintaining a reverent, lyrical tone appropriate for a fable. However, the high register is relentless, lacking the variance in psychic distance or texture needed to make the climax distinct from the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and lyrically cohesive, maintaining a steady, elevated tone suitable for the cosmic subject matter. However, it often drifts into "purple" territory with high-concept abstractions that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistently ornate but distancing, prioritizing poetic affect over narrative immediacy. The omniscient perspective summarizes emotional states ("charisma quiet yet undeniable") instead of demonstrating them through behavior or perception.

    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and fable-like, often telling the reader the emotional significance of moments ("humble rebellion") instead of earning it. The tone hovers in a "saccharine middle," lacking the grit or distinct perceptual signature of a specific POV under stress. It falls into "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, explaining the symbolism as it happens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.0)

This creates a distance that prevents immersion, filtering the experience through the narrator's interpretation rather than the character's immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.0)
    The voice is marred by severe keyword stuffing, with phrases like "lantern-moth hush" and "humming quartz colonnade" repeated verbatim four times each in a short text. This mechanical looping destroys immersion and creates a monotonous, artificial rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overly elevated and intervenes frequently to explain the lesson to the reader ("Selene finally understood that..."), creating a "helpful narrator" effect.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying on a high-lyric register that feels manufactured.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on elevated, poetic diction ("whispering through brass lenses") that creates distance. The tone feels performative, prioritizing the appearance of profundity over emotional immediacy or distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lullaby-like tone but lacks modulation, remaining static regardless of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.1)
    The omniscient, fable-like voice is consistent but creates excessive distance, preventing emotional proximity to the experience. The tone creates a barrier rather than a bridge, relying on high-register abstractions rather than grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and remote, relying on "purple" descriptors ("regally unpretentious," "hushed cathedral") that create distance. The narrative stance is confident but leans heavily on telling over showing, describing the "presence" of the titan rather than dramatizing it through interaction. The tone feels manufactured to sound epic rather than earned through voice distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a monotonous, hushed reverence that distances the reader. The reliance on abstract adjectives to describe mental states ("periodically eternal") weakens the psychic distance, making the POV feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, prioritizing elaborate metaphors over clarity ("ink fell like rain on dead stories").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.0)
    The point of view head-hops freely from Liora to the collective villagers, to Mara, to a child, and back, preventing deep engagement with any single perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic register, but suffers from "purple" excesses and lack of distance control. The reliance on stock "lyric" markers (dying sun, whispers, broken things) flattens the specific perceptual signature into a generic poetic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is marred by clunky, redundant phrasing like "olfactorily sensitive nose" (a nose is inherently olfactory) and bureaucratic diction ("journalize") that clashes with the fable-like tone. These choices distance the reader and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains an excessive psychic distance, filtering all experience through broad, fable-like abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)

    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is cohesive but leans into a saccharine fairytale register that softens the impact of the potentially darker "rotting scar" imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.0)

While the focus remains on Liora, the lack of distinct, grounded perception makes the voice feel generic.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, blending high-mythic flowery prose with jarring meta-commentary, most notably when the narration explicitly names the technique ("Through progressive disclosure, the canyon revealed...").

The tone is monotonously reverent, lacking the modulation required to create narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on explanatory telling and filter verbs ("she knew," "she recognized," "she realized") which creates distance and reduces immediacy. The psychic distance is static, summarizing the character's understanding rather than immersing the reader in her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.2)

The tone feels artificial and constructed around the inclusion of specific phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and assertion (“Mira understood,” “She knew”) rather than immersive scene work. Narrative distance is too remote to convey the immediacy of the threat, and the shift to the “trusted allies” epilogue feels disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct but overly flowery, leaning heavily on purple phrasing ("billowing like a sigh") that distances the reader. The prompt phrase "positively wistful" jars against the high-poetic register, feeling mechanically inserted rather than voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.3)

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is too remote, summarizing events ("Lia traced," "Lia fabricated") instead of immersing the reader in the moment of discovery. The voice leans into purple prose ("singing the echo of forgotten songs") that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by overwrought phrasing and adjective stacking ("earnest whimsy," "luminous constellation"). The tone slides into sentimentality, lacking the distance or control needed to make the emotional beats feel authentic rather than performed.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is marred by the mechanical repetition of complex phrases ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective," "weathered innocence") which appear multiple times in a short space, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is a competent but generic third-person limited that drifts into "fantasy narrator" register. The repetition of the phrase "quietly deliberate" acts as a crutch for characterization rather than a distinct voice texture. There is little variance in rhythm or psychic distance to match the shifting intensity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on adverbs and oxymorons ("shrewdly innocent," "forgiving skeptic") that tell rather than show. The repetition of these specific phrasings creates a drone-like quality that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, favoring exposition over immersion (e.g., "The locksmith’s mind, always reflective, turned inward...").

The distance prevents any visceral connection to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistently poetic and distinct, but the reliance on repeated distinct phrases ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") creates a mechanical rhythm that feels more like a checklist than an organic narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, literary tone but slips into "committee voice" abstraction ("newborn memory," "crystallized time"). The narration is overly helpful, explaining the meaning of every action as it happens, which distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. POV is stable but lacks a distinct, individual perceptual signature beyond generic poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone, but suffers from distancing filter verbs ("She heard," "She noted," "She saw").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and abstract, creating distance rather than immersion. The reliance on high-register metaphorical phrasing ("vector of unfinished plans") dominates the narration, flattening the distinctness of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative voice is shattered by the compulsive repetition of the phrase "excruciatingly gentle" (six times in a short text) and "bear" similes, making the prose read like a malfunctioning generator. The copy-paste error where a paragraph repeats creates a jarring break in the narrative stance, destroying immersion and distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered ("He felt," "He realized") and unnaturally elevated. The mechanical insertion of required phrases disrupts the rhythm, making the voice feel constructed rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy-handed poetic affectation that distances the reader from the immediate reality of the scene. The tone is monotonic in its reverence, lacking the modulation required to distinguish moments of discovery from moments of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and overly interpretive, constantly explaining the symbolism of the scene ("bridge of intention," "covenant of love") rather than trusting the action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice creates distance through relentless poeticism ("kaleidoscopic prayers," "living compass"), prioritizing decorative phrasing over immediate interiority. The tone is consistently elevated and breathless, lacking the modulation required for genuine narrative traction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but heavily filtered through distancing verbs ("She realized," "She understood") and relies on "poetic" abstraction over concrete grounding. The tone leans into sentimentality without earning the emotional weight through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant, relying on summary and "tell" rather than immediate scene work. The lack of dramatized dialogue flattens the interaction between the carver and the spirit.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the forced repetition of specific phrases ("thistled calm") which draws attention to the writing's artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly formal and explanatory ("sift through sedimentary layers," "paradox I cherish"), creating distance. It reads more like an essayist's monologue than the immediate, sensory experience of a sewer dweller.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, fable-like quality but slips into affectation, with awkward phrasings inserted to accommodate prompt words ("process across unlearning hatred"). The tone is consistent but distant, lacking the specific perceptual signature that brings a POV to life.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a breathless, elevated tone that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("Mara knew," "She understood") to convey information. This creates psychic distance and tells the reader what to feel instead of immersing them in the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized and precious, often explaining the magic ("shard of hush") rather than allowing it to exist ambiguously. The tone borders on "helpful narrator" syndrome, prioritizing exposition over immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is stable, staying with Mara, but the narrative voice is marred by excessive adjectival stacking and melodramatic phrasing ("slithering susurrus"). The voice struggles to maintain authority under the weight of the forced vocabulary, creating a register that feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mythic voice is largely consistent but broken by register clashes, specifically the technical "fractal generating patterns" against the rustic tone. Narrative distance remains too remote, observing success rather than inhabiting a moment of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical quality, fitting the fable-like mode. However, it leans on distancing similes (&quot;like ink,&quot; &quot;like water,&quot; &quot;like a sigh&quot;) that filter the immediacy of the experience. The tone is sustained but risks monotony due to the lack of rhythmic variation during the high-stakes polishing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but heavily adjectival, leaning into purple prose ("mourning the world," "dying beasts"). The integration of prompt phrases like "intangibly tangible" creates awkward rhythmic stumbling blocks that disrupt the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice attempts a mythic register but slips into purple prose ("cosmos contract," "filament of shared breath"). The register is disrupted by the clumsy phrasing of the fortune cookie backstory, creating a dissonance between the ancient setting and the modern/casual prompt insert.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a uniform, elevated intensity that lacks the modulation required to distinguish the climax from the setup.

    The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive and florid, frequently pausing the action to explain the metaphysical significance of events.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("winking hush" used three times, "calmly inventive" twice) which breaks immersion. The narrative distance is too remote, treating the protagonist with an unearned reverence that precludes intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elya’s glass-artist eye: “glassy hush,” “luminous shards humming,” syntax molten when fire rises, brittle when frost cracks. No head-hops; perceptual signature remains consistent. Patterned repetition (“drifting resonance… steadily adaptive”) is taught early and resolves in final cadence, justifying lyric echo.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s sensory filter; diction (“wild tumble of the sea,” “ghostly harp”) is lyrical yet consistent. Rhythm swells and subsides with the tonal beats, mirroring the fork’s resonance. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is unbroken. The perceptual signature—temperature as emotion—remains distinctive and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Marlow notices “patient sigh” of sea, “phosphorescent ink…like ghosts,” syntax lengthens underwater. Rhythm modulates with pressure—clipped when lungs compress, wave-long in light ripples. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bound. Filter verbs (“felt,” “understood”) are voice-motivated, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature filters setting through her risk-ear—“amplified quiet,” “secret heartbeat.” Syntax lengthens in calm dawn, shortens at midnight beat: “She rang once.” No dialogue, so voice must carry texture; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. One softening tic: “gently persistent rhythm” is repeated twice; otherwise rhythm modulates with scene heat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Milo’s perceptual filter: breath, color, stone, pollen. Diction (“spiritually curious,” “pilgrim of sparks”) occasionally rises above the camera-artisan’s likely lexicon, but the rhythmic breath-count lines teach the pattern early and hold.

No dialogue to distort voice; overall a distinctive, consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s synesthetic perception: “trembling fabric that resonated with both loss and renewal.” Rhythm swells and ebbs with the garden’s breath, no head-hopping.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—“silica into life,” “weighty lightness”—with rhythmic cadence that mimics torch rotation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    First-person POV stable; no head-hop. Voice carries performer’s kinetic diction (“backflips for circles, rolls for slashes”) and perceptual selectivity for spatial threat. Compression and lyric pattern (“rusted... sighed... stars”) taught in paragraph 1, paid off in luminescent closure. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” zone—but narrator is self-reflective stunt artist, so lexicon tolerated. Rhythm modulates from dense metaphor to short climactic beats, supporting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught early by the repeated “ambered hush” and “marbled hush” pattern; closure pays it off when the hush becomes the medium into which the map disperses. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts—long breath-like sentences that mirror the act of “summarizing silence.” No dialogue appears, so dialogue tests are N/A. Diction stays within the oracle’s plausible arcane register; no filter-verb clutter or register drift under pressure.

Dialogue absent; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, lyrical, mechanic-precise: “mechanically warm,” “holographic lattice,” “ violin bow on frozen strings.” Perceptual signature is Lira’s—every metaphor is filtered through turbine logic and alien flora. No dialogue; hence no voice convergence risk. Patterned repetition (“icy warmth,” “magnetic nexus at twilight”) is taught early and reprised at closure, legible under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s musician ear: “unplayed notes hung like ghosts,” “sigh that seemed to echo the ghost’s own breath.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with bow pressure; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays stable and filters every perception through Mara’s diction (“drowsy alertness,” “religious skepticism” as internal label). Rhythm self-modulates under pressure—long, humid sentences early, then shorter pulses as the wheel is appraised. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he felt…he listened…he realized”) but it occurs in a low-pressure beat and does not blunt immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: vellum-draped body, loose memory as water slipping fingers, synesthetic silence “healed even broken thoughts.” Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic breath of cathedral-like library; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is sidestepped; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric maintains steady distance, cadence slows to match breath-music motif; no head-hop. Filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy (“seemed to approve”), yet diction is consistent and perceptual signature stays tethered to Liora’s auditory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice owns a consistent lyric-elliptical texture; diction stays within the narrator’s philosophical register. Sentence rhythm modulates from long, wind-howled clauses to staccato “encoded breaths,” mirroring rising sweep of the lantern. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature is distinct, though occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing” level—edges toward loftiness rather than lived-in grit.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, ritualistic, and consistent: syntactic elongation mirrors echoing loops, lexicon stays within priestly register. Perceptual signature is strong—“rosary of reverberations,” “honey over stone.” No dialogue to test, so voice-distinctiveness rests on narration alone. The patterned repetition of “decorates with silence” and “muffled clarity” is taught early and paid off, justifying the stylistic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric close-distance stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is music-from-silence synesthesia: “upended hush,” “ripple a note she could finally see.” Syntax mirrors crescendo—long breathless clauses build to short declarative “Conduct.” No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on rhythmic control of description, which remains character-particular and pressure-responsive. Minor over-alliteration (“fractured into shards” / “cascaded” / “conductor”) is voice-consistent and forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, consistent in register; diction stays within cosmic-lyric idiom. Perceptual signature leans philosophical rather than bodily, but maintains stable distance. No dialogue to test naturalism. Occasional template cadence (“each…each…each”) mildly dulls propulsion but pattern is taught early and paid off. High-band gate missed only because closure line repeats prior phrasing without fresh syntactic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Marin; perceptual signature is vibration-centric diction (“tugged at her marrow,” “soft pulse inside her chest”). Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences during reversed playback, shorter clauses at flip moment. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Free indirect clean: “she remembered” segues into paraphrase, not exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is meteorological-bibliophile: “each flash’s hue,” “echo that lingered.” Syntax lengthens and softens under layered tranquility, then tightens into monosyllables at the shaft drop: “slipped the message tube.” No head-hops; psychic distance stays close-third. Punctuation clean; lyric fragments serve dusk-hush tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lyric, textured voice sustains throughout: “humming silhouettes,” “ethically playful grin,” “soft, grainy, humming” time. Syntax mirrors poet’s spiralling motion—long breathless clauses that tighten into final knot. Perceptual signature selective (ink-stained notebooks, electric scent) without head-hop. No filter-verb clusters; patterned repetition of “rope,” “pattern,” “echo” pays off in luminescent ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person omniscient stays stable; perceptual signature is sonic, wave-like, matching violinist’s trait. Syntax swells and fades in imitation of bow strokes; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is luxuriant yet controlled: “taste of old rain,” “liquid gold,” syntactic variation mirrors the grotto’s shimmer. Perceptual signature is perfumer-sharp—every emotion is noted by olfactory nuance. No dialogue, so no contamination. Under peak stress (“vortex of colors”), diction compresses but never fragments; rhythm stays deliberate, matching measured detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person narration keeps a consistent lyric distance, with perceptual signature filtered through Mara’s cargo-broker eye (“crates of atlases,” “cargo of kindness”). Syntax is fluid, rhythms vary, and no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy. Dialogue is minimal; when the keeper speaks, his diction is indistinct from Mara’s narrative voice, but the brevity limits contamination. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Mara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    The omniscient lyric voice sustains a consistent luminous diction (“luminescent ache,” “ribbons of violet”) that feels purposeful rather than decorative. No head-hopping; focalization stays wide but anchored to Arlen’s perceptual filter. Syntax modulates: longer rolling sentences for orchard description, clipped fragments at the glyph reveal. No dialogue to test naturalism, but the narrative ear is musical without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: Mira notices light “fractured on the ripples,” hears whispers “carving a new second from the void.” Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathless sentences during vortex, then clipped “She understood.” No head-hop; distance remains close.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person omniscient hovers lightly above the conjurer yet stays consistent; diction (“dovetail,” “vellum and old rune ink”) matches arcane scholar without sliding into purple. Rhythm modulates with long breathed sentences that mirror subterranean hush; no filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Dialogue is absent by design; voice remains singular and coherent. Perceptual signature is more poetic than idiosyncratic—still, it sustains lyric control without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter: “sapphire hush” recurs as her private coinage, and diction stays within a self-taught scavenger’s lexicon. Rhythm swells with the blue glow, then subsides, mirroring her shift from stealth to service. No dialogue appears, so voice carries the entire load and remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close maintains botanist’s perceptual signature: light refracts like “tiny prisms,” rain leaves a “cool sheen.” Syntax lengthens during observation, then tightens into heartbeat-metronome staccato, mirroring storm rhythm. No dialogue, so cadence and diction carry the load; voice never drifts into textbook tone. Filter verbs appear (“seemed to breathe”) but read as warranted humility, not leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s painterly sensorium; diction (“bruised sky,” “gutted candles”) is specific and consistent. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“She lifted the amber brooch”—mirroring breathless awe. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence holds. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited adheres to Lira; no head-hop. Syntax is musical, patterned—parallel clauses, anaphora—teaching its cadence early and holding to final “music hidden in everyday breath.” Diction stays within romantic-fantasy register; perceptual signature is wonder-saturated, not individuated. Rhythm breathes with scene crescendo; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent; no voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is archivist-librarian: synesthetic cataloguing—brass “smells of distant tides,” echoes settle “like a librarian turning pages.” Rhythm matches wave intervals: long sentences inhale, short fragments exhale. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal diction stays thrifted, never drifts into academic overkill. Under stress (“distant shout broke the quiet”) compression arrives—“he answered without hesitation”—proving rhythmic control heightens pressure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through the mapper’s compass-eye; diction (“skeletal fingers,” “phantom energy”) is patterned early and paid off. Rhythm modulates—long breaths in mist, clipped steps on spiral stairs—without losing control, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric distances matches Lira’s skeptical remove; diction stays within her lexicon—“spiraled stool,” “lattice of old wood.” Compression taught in first sentence—“sea breathed mist”—is paid off in final “ocean’s breath” ink. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on rhythmic control of long sentences that mirror whale song cadence. Filter verbs are minimal and motive-driven: “seemed to pulse” aligns with her epistemic caution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is crystalline, mineral, and consistent: “prismatic escondite,” “spatial mutiny,” “chilled promise” all belong to an immortal who thinks in facets and fields. Syntax lengthens and contracts with magnetic pulses, creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular. One template cadence cluster—“the… the… the…” in corridor list—drops it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual filter: brass “dulled by decades of careful handling” is a con-noir observation, not museum data. Rhythm compresses under stress—clusters of monosyllables (“balance, give, receive, equal”) mimic chant. No head-hop; free indirect clean. Register stays within her lexicon; final wind metaphor grows from curtain flutter she physically sees, so diction earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains incandescent restraint: long vowel cadences, controlled metaphor density, diction rooted in stationer’s craft (“satchel heavy with purpose and paper”). Perceptual signature—every observation bent through light-refract lexicon—never falters. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he would refract that hum”) and pattern-taught early. A hairline slip: “incandescent restraint” is self-diagnostic, but occurs mid-passage, not at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person lyric voice is distinct: “rusted bones,” “cold filament,” “palimpsest of voices”—perceptual signature is consistent and tide-modulated. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Pattern of layered fragments is taught early and paid off in the final projection; elision (“my name is unimportant”) is purposeful, not obstructive. Rhythm breathes with tide beats; no head-hopping or register drift. A whisper below 9.0 only because the voice edges toward poetic uniformity at times.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is acoustical—“hum,” “sigh,” “echo”—rather than visual. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on lyrical syntax and rhythmic anaphora (“She…”) which risks templating yet sustains incantatory fit. Diction stays within a myth-buster’s range, though “epistemic compass” edges academic. Filter verbs cluster slightly but serve lyric pulse, not detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Mira with perceptual signature—“orderly intuitive mind” filters carnival chaos into pattern recognition. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Prose rhythm swells toward lyrical cadence at lantern-lit reveals, matching carnival aura. Occasional elevated register (“kaleidoscope of music, scent”) momentarily drifts from Mira’s pragmatic lens but remains consistent across text.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is crystalline, low-frequency, and science-haunted: “powdery basalt,” “nascent Earth sunrise,” “chemical vapor like a ghost.” Syntax lengthens and breathes to mimic the dawning hush, then fractures into staccato clicks at the moment of capture. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent—he sees the world as exposure times and focal lengths. Minor dock for one ornamental adjective string (“soft gold and lingering shadows”) that briefly prettifies rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s tactile synesthesia; perceptual signature is unmistakable (“magnetic calm,” “magnetic calm settle over her” refrains echo like a heartbeat). Syntax breathes with repair tempo—long clauses while she studies ripples, staccato fragments at patch adhesion. No head-hopping; every noticed detail passes through her non-visual filters.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: she sees “metal ribs shivering,” thinks in cartographic metaphor. Syntax flexes with pressure—short fragments when the bell tolls, longer cadences for reflection. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “singular convergence” is the only elevated phrase she might actually use.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and liturgical cadence, mirroring the tuner’s ritual patience. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the swell of imagined footsteps, creating perceptual signature. Diction stays within plausible arcane-philosopher lexicon; no POV leakage. No dialogue to test, so voice contamination risk is nil.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person lyric close to Mara; POV stable, no head-hop. Perceptual signature limited: repeated “hush” and “scent” become mantra rather than idiosyncratic filter. Rhythm swells toward incantatory cadence that suits temple awe, but clauses grow syrupy under pressure. Diction occasionally overshoots POV lexicon—“lonesome splendor,” “conceptual repricing” tone—but deviation is consistent and intentional.

No head-hopping, no filter-verb drift; the piece teaches its pattern and pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains tide-and-loom cadence with tidal syntax of long swells and soft caesuras. Diction stays within weaver’s poetic register; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Lena’s synesthetic perception—“microscopic bells that sang around the nickel”—and the cadence surges then stills in sync with the garden’s inhale/exhale. Diction remains within painterly lexis; no filter-verb clusters or head-hop leaks occur. The voice is recognizably one consciousness, but it never modulates under stress—no fracture or compression—so it stops just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric compresses perception through Lysander’s synesthetic bias; diction stays botanic-sonic (“tiny ribs promising a rhythm”). No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Rhythm mirrors insect pulse without template cadence. Distinctive, not yet hairline-perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric close-distance stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic-eclectic: “rusted chains of light,” “storybook water” — idiosyncratic, consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person distant stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is aural—Mara catalogues vibrations, sighs, echoes—giving the narration a tuned-ear texture that distinguishes it from generic fantasy diction.

The only POV modesty lapse is the omniscient tag “legend whispered,” quickly corrected by in-scene perception.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s perceptual bias: every noun is rain- or mineral-scented, every verb is a hush or tremor.

    Voice achieves perceptual signature: Mara clocks the world in pendulum beats and metallic glows, compressing diction under stress—“pendulum paused, world breath-held.” Lyric elision (“searing reverie”) is taught early and paid off in molten horizon, so pattern stays legible. No dialogue, so no register drift; free-indirect texture stays consistent, and sentence rhythm flexes from tidal surge to gear-hum without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: selective attention to brass hinges, filament tug, dust applause. Syntax modulates with cadence—long breathless sentences for nocturnal hush, clipped final line for dawn. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within poetic gardener lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric distance is stable; diction favors precise nouns (“obsidian spire,” “silverfish surge”) and rhythmic parallelism that mimics cartographic layering. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Perceptual signature—mapping mind that sees gaps everywhere—persists to last line. Filter-free immediacy; metaphors stay inside POV’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—she “senses hunger in the air,” not an abstract city. Syntax lengthens under misty description, then clips into verbs—“She pressed play”—at the climax, mirroring her transition from patience to action. No dialogue appears; absence is apt for a story about silence. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and warranted by meditative tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent incantatory cadence, syntactic parallelism ("each fragment... each speck... each syllable") that mirrors ritual rhythm without drum-beat monotony. Perceptual signature is color-and-texture obsessed—broken porcelain catching dim light, powder like frozen breath—utterly specific to this sensibility. No dialogue, hence no register clash. Psychic distance stays tight: "she felt the crystalline chill travel up her arms." Compression under pressure is flawless: three short sentences carry the final dissolve. Minor risk of purple in "kaleidoscope that painted... muted rainbows," but the image is earned and closure-essential.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical third-person hovers just above the teacher’s sensorium, matching autumn-library hush. Diction—“velvet shadows,” “captured sunrise”—stays within poetic register without purple drift. Rhythm clusters sibilants that mimic hushed choir: “shelves that smelled of old paper and rain…whispers…silence could be sharpened.” No dialogue, so voice distinctness defaults to internal texture—consistent, unshowy, controlled. No head-hop, distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: silver bells, nectar dusk, amber veins—metaphors stay within Mara’s truth-tuned sensorium. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for dusk, staccato “Echo” glyph—supporting pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays poetic yet precise. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop. Slight register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator, not Mara, but occurs post-closure and reads as choral coda acceptable at this distance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice owns a perfumed, tidal rhythm—long sentences swell and recede, mirroring bay water. Diction stays within a poetic but plausible register (“brine and promise,” “ember that could not be named”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is filtered through scent and sound. Dialogue is minimal and paratactic, preserving the hush; the elderly woman’s whisper feels like a tide-line, not an exposition drop.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person alien omniscience sustains mineral distance yet permits telepathic warmth; diction stays lapidary (“chiseled gaze,” “marble flesh”) without drifting into tourist purple. Syntax elongates like underwater suspension—comma-rich cadence mirrors slow currents. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it does, through consistent mineral metaphors and tidal rhythm. Patterned elision (“cascading revelations”) is taught early and repaid in the final luminous cascade, so experimental compression stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-mathematical, syntax loops like steps (“each step a…”) mimicking staircase recursion. Diction stays inside Aric’s dual poet-geek lexicon; no head-hop. Rhythmic control peaks in the final clause-song: “a perpetual promise whispered through stone”—pressure crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: moonlight “coaxing a hidden shore” is painterly, not tourist-catalogue. Cadence modulates: long breathless clauses for reverie, clipped fragments at dawn transition. No head-hop; courier’s interior is inferred through gesture, preserving distance control. A few overwritten adjectives (“saffron quiet” repeated) keep it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains sensorial compression and rosewater lexis; diction stays inside Liora’s cultured register. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Rhythm is incantatory, repeating noun-adjective pairs; pattern is taught early and pays off in final prism line. Filter-verb clusters (“the scent rosewater mingled”) mildly dull immediacy but fit texture-first strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person voice maintains tight psychic distance, filtering every detail through the maker’s clock-work mind: tides become breaths, yoyo arcs become escapements, salt grit becomes gear grease. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the yoyo’s spin, creating rhythmic propulsion. Diction stays within a coastal tinker’s lexicon; no academic register drift. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. The only minor slip is the repeated noun-phrase “bleak exhilaration,” which borders on self-diagnosis, but it occurs early enough to be absorbed into the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Mara’s perceptual skew: “eyes flickered with…phosphorescence,” “air taste of copper and rot,” creating a distinct gothic texture. Syntax is lush but patterned—repetition of “lingering luminance,” “repulsive allure”—teaching its incantatory cadence early and holding it to the final line. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; narrative diction stays within nightmare register without register drift. Psychic distance compresses under pressure, climax rendered in fragments that match sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight, rhythmic, and ocean-obsessed; perceptual signature is consistent. Syntax mimics fractal loops—cascading participles, anaphoric “each”—serving accumulative design. Diction occasionally over-roses (“silver threads destined to dissolve”) but remains legible. No dialogue, no head-hop; voice never editorializes beyond prophet’s ken.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual bias: curves, fracture-lines, wind resonance. Syntax grows sinuous under stress (“spiraled outward… fractal echoes”) then shortens at crest (“She tucked… ready to redraw”), mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so those bullets are waived; prose itself carries idiom. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“seemed to stir”) they flag epistemic modesty, not dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Arlen’s perceptual filter: “ivy strangled… turning steel sleepers into green veins” is historian-metaphor, tourist-free. Diction—“catalogued each symbol,” “gilded narrative”—mirrors his scholarly lexicon without drifting into academic parody. Rhythm tightens under pressure: sentence fragments (“He lifted… felt the heat…”) accelerate the mailbox beat. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; the only microscopic slip is one “as if truth itself were pulling” which momentarily abstracts the agent, keeping this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is unmistakably surveyor-poet: “measuring each line of coastline while feeling the pulse of every missing tide.” Syntax stretches without breaking—“interlaced absence marking every missing arch”—and contracts under pressure—“She waded.” No dialogue, so focus stays on perceptual signature. Brass inkwell’s map etchings extend her gaze, keeping diction anchored to maritime lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Mara’s perceptual filter: “scent of old parchment rose like a mournful sigh” is indexer-specific synesthesia. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during vault descent, longer rhythmic piles while cataloguing. No head-hop or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction across speech is waived; internal voice remains coherent and textured.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close filters every perception through the lantern maker’s artisan gaze: glass ‘thin as a sigh’, sundial shadow ‘like ink’. Syntax stretches into long breath-clauses that mimic the act of glass-blowing, then tightens into single-stroke verbs during crane release—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiosyncrasy; diction occasionally over-ornaments (“amber horizon refracting into rainbows that sang to the wind”) but stays pattern-consistent. Perceptual signature is strong enough that any swap of maker for another craft would fracture the metaphor chain, meeting 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains close to sensorium; diction (“intangibly tangible,” “perturbation theory”) stays within his technical grief vocabulary. Rhythm accelerates into fragments at climax—“He caught one shard…”—then widens for final canvas, mirroring pulse of event. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. One filter-verb cluster (“he realized”) nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lira’s pilot gaze; perceptual signature is optical—visor reflections, drone lenses, crystal prisms. Syntax mirrors humming ascent: clauses lengthen with rising tone, then snap short at lever pull. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s interior is inferred only through visible eyes. Filter verbs (“felt”) are minimal and justified by physiological shock.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    First-person voice is consistent, compressed, and lyrical without purple drift; diction like “sieved hush” is pattern-taught early and paid off at the humming wood.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the negotiator; perceptual signature is weather-worn and maritime—salt, rope fibers, moon-metronome. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures during the rope release, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction is moot. The lyric compression (“furrowed hush”) is patterned early and paid off in the final whisper, earning rhythmic control without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric third-person close stays consistent; perceptual signature is maritime and elegiac—“sea breeze felt merrily melancholic.” Syntax is rhythmic, sentence lengths vary, diction stays within navigator’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue to judge; voice remains singular and uncompressed. Filter verbs are few and purposeful; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)

Register drifts toward the elevated but remains legible and pattern-taught from line 1; no head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person adheres to Nara’s perceptual filter: hush, shimmer, rust, weightlessness. Syntax elongates then fractures at rupture—“a pale wind breathed”—mirroring seam split. No head-hop; compressions (“ghost of forgotten propulsion”) taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: selective, synesthetic, slightly mythic. Syntax swells and contracts with the glowing beats; no head-hop. Diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon while reaching for the numinous. One template cadence repetition (“every ripple…every flicker…”) is brief and pattern-serving, not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught: “winking hush,” “phosphorescent pulse,” “quiet thunder” recur with shifting charge. Perceptual signature is Kael’s—angles, glimmers, constellations—never touristic. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for calm decoding, staccato fragments (“clink softly”) for stealth. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; diction stays within a sentinel’s plausible lexicon. Elision (“slipping between corridors”) is strategic, paid off by the final lattice of light.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Selene’s perceptual filter: “salt and ancient fire,” “mathematical sequences,” “cosmos’s hidden rhythm” all belong to an eel herder who thinks in tide-tables. Rhythm swells and subsides like waves—long sentences for aurora awe, clipped fragments (“She knelt”) under peak pressure. No head-hopping; cosmic vocabulary is earned by her calling. The repeated anaphora “the…” in the last third edges toward litany, slightly diluting vocal edge; otherwise voice is distinct and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-cosmic yet body-anchored: “furiously tranquil” is not asserted but enacted in the climb and whisper. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath: cumulative clauses mimic storm swell, then cut to “timer clicked.” No dialogue; perceptual signature is poet-as-astronomer of wounds, noticing silver veins in clouds and ink. Compression taught early (“vigil in pause”) and paid off in final drizzle blessing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric-accumulative voice is stable, taught by line 1 (“rusted library under stars cradled a thin line of light”) and paid off in the lantern finale. Perceptual signature is poet-visionary: light = applause, rust = veins, pennies = universes—consistent diction without filter-verb bloat. Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to staccato fragments that mimic candle flicker. No dialogue to corrupt voice; interiority stays within vagrant-poet lexicon, avoiding academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is perceptual signature incarnate: a pianist who notices “ivory keys,” “silver rain” leaves, and stair-steps as notes. Rhythm mirrors tempo—long breathless clauses for ascent, staccato fragments when compasses dim. Diction stays inside lexicon (“splice,” “chord,” “metronome”) without academic drift. Patterned repetition of “steely longing” and “flickering compasses” is taught early and paid off when both motifs transmute into starlight and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
