  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena, and perceptual signature is consistent (scientific observation filtered through personal stakes). However, diction frequently drifts into academic register that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated: "preprocesses reality by etching subtle grooves," "accumulated dust patterns, preprocesses reality by diffracting spectra." The phrase "preprocesses reality" appears seven times, reading as a conceptual placeholder rather than Elena's lived idiom. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance is mostly steady, but moments like "her drive to strip needless drama from the universe's violent stories undimmed" read as narrator commentary rather than Elena's in-the-moment thought, and the phrase "kindled humility" is repeated as a thematic tag rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited. Voice carries a lyric register ("drifting resonance," "frosting the canyon floor with delicate veils") that is consistent but edges into elevated diction not always grounded in Elara's embodied urgency. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic—filtered through her glass-artist lens without idiosyncratic biases. Psychic distance is controlled, yet the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("she saw her own life reflected") that tells rather than dramatizes insight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice maintains consistent distance. However, the prose lacks perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic ("eyes lit with purpose," "heart burned with a singular motivation") rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated, abstracted diction ("souls' invisible fire," "tangible chorus of souls") that does not cohere with a shipwreck survivor's interior texture. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains static; emotional peaks do not modulate rhythm or syntax in character-particular ways.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature filters detail through an undertaker's lens (silt graves, petrified scrolls, burial echoes). Diction stays consistent—elevated but coherent ("algae-veiled alcove," "fractured prisms," "perpetual bubble of breathable air"). Some sentences lean ornate ("its cracks mirroring the fractures in his spirit"), edging toward purple without fully crossing. Psychic distance tightens as pressure mounts (specters clawing, mounting lung pressure). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person POV tracks Mira's perceptual signature ("amplified quiet," "silver hair catching starlight") and the community's collective stance without head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit (Tomas grumbling, Mira kneeling to persuade). However, repeated stems and template cadence ("her voice a steady ripple," "her eyes kind but unyielding," "her gently persistent steps") and filter verbs ("She saw the potential," "Mira knew the moment") accumulate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The phrase "gently persistent" recurs four times, flattening what should be a dynamic trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focused on Elias. Perceptual signature is present (spiritually curious, attuned to sparks) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("foggy lucidity," "halos in violet wisteria glow") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The brief dialogue ("I see the lights too," "Breathe with the projection," "Release it") is functional but minimal, lacking subtext or goal pursuit tension. Elias's internal texture stays consistent, though some lines ("the pilgrim of sparks igniting her inner fire") read as external labeling rather than lived perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Elias's perception, and diction reflects his designer idiom ("hyperbolic geometries," "pseudospherical helices"). However, register frequently drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("quaking reverie," "retrocognitively trapped," "exponential flares") that clashes with embodied urgency; the prose reads more like academic exposition than lived crisis. Perceptual signature is present (he notices sap veins, saddle curves) but does not modulate under stress—syntactic rhythm and lexicon remain uniform whether he is trembling in opening or gasping free at closure. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature that would distinguish crisis from calm.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose recycles identical descriptors for Elara across beats: "staggering grace" (three times), "patiently strategic" (twice), "chained liberator" (three times). Diction drifts into elevated register ("incongruous relic," "iridescent feathers from the forbidden glowbirds") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices plot-relevant objects (piano bench, latch, vials) without bias or selective attention shaped by her history.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout, with consistent synesthetic filtering ("heard colors faintly," "verdant haze into a low, thrumming chord"). Distance modulates appropriately during high-pressure forging beats, and the perceptual signature (color-as-sound) remains character-particular. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-native: "abyssal gloom," "auroral coruscating," "mitotic fire." The prose texture is lyric and dense, but under peak stress the voice maintains ornate complexity rather than compressing to Elias's immediate need, slightly undermining embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "destiny's hinge creaking," "savvy instinct urged flight") that reads more as ornamental poeticism than Elara's lived interiority under pressure. Figurative density pervades every paragraph without variation in cadence or perceptual signature tied to her professional skill set, flattening voice into a committee lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, but the voice is contaminated by grandiose declarations ("Lo, the heart of earth yields its molten soul") that read as performative rather than character-specific perception. The dramatic narration element forces diction shifts into elevated register ("primordial blaze," "dreams uncrushed") that clash with the contemplative baseline and flatten under repetition. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature lacks selectivity; every beat receives the same theatrical overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    Register lurches between pulp-thriller diction ("his smile a rusted blade") and overwrought metaphor ("phobia clawing like old friends") without a stable perceptual signature. Harlan's dialogue ("Elara, my perfect echo—come back, embrace the lie") sounds like a villain audition rather than human speech. The multiple false endings with visible self-correction ("No—word count overrun," "wait, refine to fit," "Actually," "But precisely") shatter any illusion of controlled narrative stance. Psychic distance is unstable: we're told Elara's phobias "quake" her mind yet she executes stunts with "sharp focus" without showing the contradiction act simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on the oracle, with brief Elara interiority in her entrance beat. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("marbled hush," "ambered") that fits the mythic tone, though at times it drifts toward ornament ("veined with regret") without grounding in concrete action. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the oracle's "Speak your need" and "By summarizing silence" feel natural to the voice. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV robotic narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("optic sensors," "servos," "core processors," "subroutine engaged") that reflects the character's machine nature without caricature. Diction remains controlled and purposeful throughout, with sentences like "Time folded inward; the first loop began" demonstrating rhythmic variety. The repeated phrase "Remarkably composed" functions as a refrain but becomes slightly mechanical by the third use. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates appropriately with the emotional arc (calm sweeping → mystical surge → quiet resumption), and the elision of how the violin triggers loops is purposeful within the experimental frame, taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on elevated, poetic diction ("resonant hush," "liminal place," "ambiguously clear") that drifts into stock lyricism rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is stable, but filter phrases ("he knew," "he sensed") pad rather than sharpen. No dialogue appears to test subtext or goal pursuit. The prose reads as a singular voice without perceptual signature tied to Elias's registrar role or Mira's guarded state.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias with consistent distance. The prose carries a textured, slightly archaic register—"specter of the earth," "bark-dry," "reluctant green"—that suits the setting and concept. However, under peak pressure (the ritual and council confrontation), the voice remains at the same elevated pitch without modulation; Elias's perceptual signature is selective but does not degrade or tighten under stress. Dialogue from Thorne and Elias advances the plot and carries subtext (Thorne's scanner faith vs. Elias's garden faith), though both speak in similarly formal cadences. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the narrative certainty matches what Elias knows.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction often drifts into elevated register incongruent with a "sky mechanic" lens: "obliging nature a quiet anchor," "fractal runes," "holographic principles… rendering sideways time flows visible and tangible." Dialogue is minimal and functional; Elara's single line lacks subtext. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. The meta-corrections at the end break narrative stance entirely, reading as authorial scaffolding left in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elias, and perceptual signature is present (lantern light, water, ghostly images). However, diction slips into elevated register at pressure points ("venerable venue," "feverish dreams," "spectral eyes urging him on") that feels more authorial than character-bound. Psychic distance is inconsistent: "No words passed his lips; the tone was set in wordless conversation" tells rather than shows the effect. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator's voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or lexical texture that would mark it as Elias's mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-close on Elara with a consistent poetic register. Perceptual signature (peripherally aware) colors her observations of aurora and illustration edges. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("auroral sorrow," "cumulative mass bending her resilient frame") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially during peak emotional beats. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("lay as testament," "winds howled a dirge") dull immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Jax; no head-hopping. Diction carries purpose ("reckless abandoned-mill explorer," "beaded valve wheel"), and the perceptual signature (heavy-lidded yet scanning, drowsy alertness) is character-specific. However, register drifts into elevated phrasing under peak stress ("psychic residue," "faith-forged anchor," "buoyant in release") that sits outside a mechanic's plausible lexicon. The radio-confession mechanism is taught midpoint but the retrospective reveal (he'd dialed in) is expositional rather than dramatized through internal voice. Purposeful elision of the dial-in moment is not taught early, arriving as a surprise that reads more authorial than organic to Jax's awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and an elevated, lyric register ("spectral figure," "verdant decay," "obedient pages"). Perceptual signature is present but generic: the keeper notices vines, scrolls, and stone with high-frequency diction that reads as narrator ornament rather than character-specific texture. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (parallelism, clause stacks) establish a deliberate rhythm, yet the voice lacks idiosyncratic coloring—diction could belong to any ethereal archivist. No dialogue appears; internal thought is sparse and abstract ("recognized its call immediately").

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV (Elias) is stable, and perceptual signature is consistent (music-therapist lens noting rhythms, breaths, melodies). However, diction drifts into prompt language at peaks: "softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance," "lifelong wonder," "ordinary magic" recur as undigested labels rather than voice-specific idiom. The phrase "dreaming roots" is poetic but never clarified—are they literal gnarled roots, or metaphor?—and the repeated use without fresh context flattens its charge. Lila's single line of dialogue ("It feels... alive") is naturalistic and goal-free, more observation than pursuit, which fits her silence but doesn't advance plot through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is attempted ("ears pressed to cold surfaces," wall-whispers) but leans toward metaphor rather than embodied perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("bronze quiet," "voiceless murmurs," "half-remembered regrets") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose reads more committee-lyric than Thorne-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent, with a slightly elevated literary register ("familiar enigma of solitude wrapping him like a well-worn fog cloak") that remains legible. POV is stable third-limited on Elias. Dialogue is minimal (the spies' single exchange) but functional. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical phrasing ("transpose life into a new key," "shadow puppeteer") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("his breath caught," "his heart pounding") are present but not excessive. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's omniscient tone ("the wind whispered approval") briefly widens without clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice attempts elevated lyric register but suffers from mechanical sentence stems: "He gripped," "He traced," "He invoked," "He stomped," "He chanted," "Elias's loops," "The pedal." Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—no idiom or bias that distinguishes Elias's way of noticing under pressure. Psychic distance remains static; the voice does not modulate with emotional intensity or collapse into compression at the climax. Diction drifts into abstract philosophical register ("undifferentiated calm," "rhetorical devices looped into relentless crescendos") that sits uneasily with the embodied priest facing immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose establishes a lyric, elevated register ("silence pooled like spilled mercury," "upturned hush") that remains consistent, but the distance is unstable: Elara's interiority oscillates between close embodiment ("bare feet whispering") and distant summary ("her motivation surging"). Repeated phrases ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush," "mirrored horizon") function as motif but also create a template cadence that flattens momentum. The boy's dialogue ("Your fortunes always hinted at this") breaks the established register without clear voice distinction, and the narration drifts into omniscience when ethereal figures are described as "drawn by the symphonies only she could conduct" without anchoring how Elara perceives this.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction tilts toward elevated register ("convolutions," "foreboding halos," "genesis of his defiance") that reads more authorial than character-particular, especially under stress. The single line of dialogue ("Begin") is functional but does nothing to establish voice. Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices glowing runes and shifting timelines but his way of seeing carries no idiosyncratic filter. Psychic distance stays consistent, which prevents slippage but also flattens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is present in the vibration-focused filtering ("vibrations humming," "palms pressed to the base"). Diction drifts into elevated literary register ("enthralling," "filament of hush," "mirrored hush," "petrified shout") that sits at the edge of the focalizer's plausible idiom but remains legible. The phrase "motivation burned quietly" and the summary mode in the final third loosen immediacy. Dialogue (signing) is minimal and functional; no voice convergence issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a scientific, observational texture ("barometric pressures," "theodolite," "anemometers"). Perceptual signature is evident in her habit of cross-referencing data and sketching vectors. However, elevated diction ("credibly curious," "encroaching chaos," "unyielding anchor") occasionally drifts above the practical voice established in her physical work, and some phrases ("her mind sidestepping linear suspicions") explain rather than enact her lateral thinking process.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias. Distance is consistent, though often elevated ("passionate subtlety," "velvet murmur," "inexorable") in ways that feel more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices what the plot requires (rope, beings, patterns) without idiosyncratic bias. The single line of dialogue ("In coils of yesterday's chain, what tomorrow unties?") is stylized and archaic, fitting the poetic conceit but not tested against conversational realism. Filter verbs ("felt," "recognized") appear but are spaced. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The elevated diction occasionally clashes with the POV's stated "roadside poet" vernacular (e.g., "temporal snags," "bioluminescent script").

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Lir's acoustically perceptive attention. Diction is elevated and lyric ("magnificent simplicity," "echo-harbor," "mendicant's bowl"), consistent with the tone but occasionally edging toward ornamental phrasing ("threads of tale-telling," "beauty bloomed eternal"). Dialogue is minimal and functional ("This hush binds us... But stories unbind"), carrying subtext and advancing the ritual without naturalistic texture. Perceptual signature is clear—Lir notices echoes, vibrations, and the interplay of sound and silence—but syntactic patterns (short declarative + metaphoric noun phrase) recur frequently, flattening rhythmic variety under peak emotional beats. Free indirect style is clean, though the final staccato fragments ("Another day awaited... His bowl ready...") risk template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptual signature reads as professionally detached ("observing a cherished painting from afar"). Diction is consistent but occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully earned by the focalizer ("subsuming magic," "affectionate illusion," "unyielding span"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Under peak stress (Mira's gasped "Now"), the prose does not compress or accelerate; rhythm remains uniform. Filter verbs ("sensing," "willed silently") appear but do not flatten immediacy. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV Elias maintains a consistent narrative distance, but voice leans generic with recycled stems ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive") and filter stacks ("he'd come," "he pocketed," "he arrived"). Dialogue is functional but flat—"Oh dear, I meant it for…" reads expository rather than goal-driven. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is stable, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is present but generic: "luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic," and abstract phrasing recur without character-particular idiom. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("I seek the artist's mark," "It haunts me too"), carrying little subtext or character distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent. The voice modulates minimally under pressure—discovery of the arbor elicits "Elara gasped," but the syntax and diction stay elevated throughout. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("felt rooted," "smiled through residual ache") occasionally dull immediacy without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited POV with a heightened, lyric register ("towers loomed like silent guardians," "embryos of roars, whispers unfurling like ferns"). Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("nascent sounds," "translucent fledglings of sound") that feels more ornamental than urgently filtered through Elara's illustrator lens. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate throughout ("gently inventive," "geometry binding heart to void"), consistent but not character-particular—it reads as authorial rather than filtered through Thorne's working conjurer's mind. Under peak pressure (embedding the eyes), syntax and lexicon remain uniform instead of compressing or intensifying, flattening the sense of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's perceptual signature is consistent—"kindly methodical," ferric tang, phantom spins—and the limited third holds steady. The woman's single line of dialogue ("You") and Elias's rumble ("For those who need") carry subtext and goal pursuit. However, "Become visible..." as both the wife's whisper and the tape's warble risks thematic echo, and some diction ("reverent silence," "sapphire-deep") elevates slightly past a crawl-space dweller's interior lexicon under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is present ("his mind racing," "circuitously sincere"). However, the prose suffers from repeated template cadence: "Reluctance peaked," "sustaining transformation," "releasing control" appear as labeled concepts rather than embodied experience. Diction drifts into abstract register ("metamorphosis," "reconstructed his perception") that distances the reader from Elias's subjective state under stress. The phrase "circuitously sincere" recurs as authorial descriptor rather than character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice remains stable in third-person limited with a distinct texture ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe"), but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("thresh meaning," "savage beauty") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The repeated phrase "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" anchor tone but verge on mannerism. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's exposition ("trails like these don't lie post-wars") carries purpose but lacks strong subtext. POV control is clean with no head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates appropriately under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is third-person limited, alternating focus between Thorne and Elara without clear section breaks—micro head-hopping occurs (Thorne's perception, then Elara's visions, then "the forces whispered motives" without clear anchor). Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into generic fantasy register ("ethereal," "essences fused"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Perceptual signature is atmospheric rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is attempted but slips into summary at key beats ("She clutched the cave pearl tighter").

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (ocean-spray triggering visions) but the prose cycles through template stems: "He [verb], [gerund]" across multiple beats. Diction elevates into stock lyric phrasing ("exile's scars softening," "bridges, not breaks") without character-specific idiom. The crowd speaks in collective murmur; no individual voice distinguishes itself, and Elias's speech at the pier reads as thematic declaration rather than goal-driven dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Elias with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated throughout ("analytically artistic masterpieces," "spectral line that once ferried souls") but remains coherent as Elias's internal register. However, sentences share repetitive stems ("He had acquired," "He knew," "He stepped") and the prose voice does not modulate with pressure—crisis and calm moments carry identical ornate texture. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative tone. The perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; any route mapper might notice these details in this way. Purposeful compression is absent; every beat is spelled out in similar cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (skeptic filtering myth through doubt, then wonder) is present but undercut by label-heavy interiority: "sympathetic skeptic," "courageously kind," "sympathy stirred." The prose maintains a consistent lyric register, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("quanta of experience linked across time") without grounding in Elara's idiom. Dialogue from the fisherman ("Cursed thing, it whispers of the drowned") carries subtext, but his single appearance limits judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature ("dimensionally aware") is consistent, but the register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("veins of liquid iron," "serpents in the void"). Diction reads as ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("symphonies of beginning") compresses without clear earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Eli; no head-hopping. Diction is dense and elevated ("deathly vitality," "viscous black ink that swirled like living mercury"), sometimes clashing with Eli's immediate crisis—register drifts toward poetic narration rather than a son's urgent grief. Perceptual signature is present (focus on Victor's "eerie vigor," the equations resolving) but inconsistent: "bitter, cerebral tang" feels authorial, not Eli's idiom. No dialogue on the page to judge. Psychic distance is controlled. Free indirect style is clean. Peak-stress moments ("At 03:17:42 precisely, the gap aligned") compress into precise calculation without embodied fear or doubt, flattening interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated diction ("incandescent restraint," "refracted truth," "blooming riotously"). However, the prose frequently lapses into label-driven interiority ("earnestly studious care," "passion leashed to precision") and over-articulated thematic commentary ("This was his grandest stationery: invitations to invented histories"). Psychic distance flattens during the closure: "Thorne smiled faintly, earnestly studious still, his gilded leaves eternal witnesses" tells rather than shows the final stance. The perceptual signature is abstract rather than character-particular, and peak moments default to stock metaphor ("armor against the silence below," "forest-maze alive with refracted times") instead of fresh, voice-specific figuration.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter ("echoes of untold pasts overlaid the present like translucent skins") is established early and recurs consistently. However, the prose often narrates the filter rather than enacting it: "layered addition deepened the texture" tells the effect instead of showing sensory or cognitive distortion in real time. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("cathedral of rust," "mocking tongue") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal (brief sailor/stevedore fragments) and serves function without subtext. Distance control is competent but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias's POV is stable, and the narration attempts a lyric register with phrases like "inside the whisper of closing pages" and "time itself turned a final leaf." Yet diction drifts into stock metaphor ("sea foam," "shadows cheering his grim ballet") and label-heavy interiority ("gloomy cheerfulness," "ephemeral compass") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. The reimagined voices (Hale, fisherman, mentor) lack distinct idiom or rhythm; they blend into a homogenous echo chamber. Purposeful compression is present in the cello-hum sequence, but the final paragraph's summary mode ("Back in the village, whispers would grow") undercuts the earned lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing (carnival lights, crowds, rafts) could belong to any observer. Diction remains consistent but leans on template cadence and repeated sentence stems ("Elara's attribute thrived," "Elara smiled," "Elara painted on"). Dialogue with Kai is functional but minimal and lacks subtext. The prose compresses key action (raft realignment, developer yacht encounter) into summary rather than scene, flattening momentum at pivotal beats. Free indirect style is clean but the voice lacks specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (technical focus on equipment, chemical reactions, photo angles). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("temporal defiance," "contrails in vacuum," "cosmic pause") that feels authorial rather than character-specific for a 1972 crater inspector. The single line of recorded dialogue ("This grain...outlasting us all") reads naturalistic. Filter verbs and introspective summary dominate emotional beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric register (e.g., "mist coated…like a lover's breath," "magnetic calm," "heartfelt artisan"). Diction elevates consistently but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("decoded truth," "oversees…with unerring intuition"). Dialogue is minimal, functional, and task-driven. Elias's perceptual signature (touch, vibration, sound) is asserted more than demonstrated through groping or spatial friction. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    Harlan's dry wit is consistent and voice-specific ("If silence had a map, this place would be its blank margin"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that clashes with the POV's urgency ("aqueous omen," "herald of the singular convergence"). Dialogue with the falcon is playful but minimal; the piece lacks a second character to test voice distinction. Filter verbs ("he fetched," "he glanced") appear frequently but remain voice-legible.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("cryptic," "infinitely patient," "wild hush"). Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices archetypal ghost-town details without character-specific bias. Dialogue (two cryptic lines) feels ornamental rather than goal-driven. Under peak pressure (the climactic revival), diction remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency, and filter verbs ("watched," "nodded") dull immediacy at closure. The repeated phrase "infinitely patient" and stock descriptors like "wild hush" approach template cadence but remain just shy of −0.4 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated, lyric register. However, the prose relies heavily on poetic stock phrases—"lonesome splendor" (recurring), "ephemeral," "gathered hush," "eternal quietude"—that read more as thematic markers than character-particular perception under stress. During peak pressure (oxygen alarm, vortex unsnarling), diction remains ornate and measured, reducing the sense of cognitive or perceptual degradation one would expect. Filter use is light, but the interiority often paraphrases action just completed ("No longer did the deep's chill claw at her soul") rather than advancing thought, flattening immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("reposeful," "thread," "hush") creates a distinct lyric texture. The prose filters perception through Elias's goal (silence, redemption), maintaining narrative modesty. However, elevated register ("bowels twisted like the tales," "wolfish howls made manifest") occasionally floats above his immediate experience, and some lines ("Hovering faintly at the periphery of vision, grateful shades watched") drift into external omniscience. No dialogue appears, so conversational subtext is not tested. Perceptual signature is present but could be more embodied—less copperlight description, more tactile engagement with the lattice and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo"), but register drifts into thesaurus-itis: "resonant awakening" and "cameo" recur as template labels rather than character-specific perception. Elias's perceptual signature is generic alchemist-mystic. Syntax varies, but rhythmic control weakens in peak beats with stacked modifiers and parallel structures that flatten urgency. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    Diction oscillates between elevated lyricism ("gossamer threads dyed the hue of orchid solace," "veins in the canyon's vast body") and generic abstraction ("fragile bloom in the desolation") without a stable perceptual signature. Register drift is pervasive: "broken precedents," "conceptual integrity," and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("soothed the soul's sharpest thorns") appear in peak beats, clashing with the folkloric frame. The sleepwalking sequence withholds Elara's interior entirely, leaving no POV-specific texture during the climactic act. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not testable, but the single-POV narration lacks rhythmic modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature (archival attention to artifact detail, reverent tone). Diction remains within Elara's reflective register throughout. However, emotional peaks are narrated through label clusters ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment," "wary wonder") rather than embodied sensation or contradictory impulse. The voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence cadence remains uniform across excavation and closure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, distance consistent, and Elara's perceptual signature (nostalgia-tech filter) is distinct. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("poignant ache," "symphony of soft whirs") that edges toward generic lyricism rather than character-specific voice. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not scored. Elision is purposeful (we see the code drawn but not every glyph), and the narrative certainty matches what Elara knows, keeping focalization clean.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "eyes sharpened," "mind raced," "ear cocked" repeat across beats without character-specific texture. Diction occasionally elevates ("echoed silence wrapped the domed chamber like a shroud") beyond the focalizer's situational register, creating mild distance drift. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Silly stars, always drawing blood!") but not distinct or subtext-rich. Voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and lyric ("ethereal hymns," "cathedral of green gloom"), which fits the atmospheric mode but occasionally drifts into decorative register ("fierce tenderness" recurs as a label rather than emerging through syntax under stress). Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices spirits, roots, moonlight—but does not shift distinctly when pressure peaks. Dialogue with Thorne is brief and serves closure without subtext or goal-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Elara. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, poetic register ("lotus-hearted threnody," "pacific resolve," "tentative peace") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Key phrases ("shrewdly innocent," "grafting new meaning") recur as labels without evolving through pressure. Elara's perceptual signature—translator's ear, methodical tracing—is present but undercut by uniform lyric texture that does not modulate with urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual filter (artist noticing light, color, texture) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("vivid mural artist," "fold of a daydream," "phantasmal whispers") that clashes with immediate sensory experience under pressure. Repeated phrase templates ("pensive mirth," "knowledge network," "paint with light") flatten the narrative voice into a recitative catalog. The wraith's single line of dialogue ("You've unveiled our lost song") reads as thematic echo rather than goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Elias is mostly stable, with clean access to his perception and motive. Distance control slips when the narrative reports Lena's interior transformations—"memories of her childhood... resurfaced," "her certainty was the true illusion"—as objective events rather than Elias's inference. The phrase "methodically playful" recurs as a tic without behavioral variation. Diction elevates beyond Elias's artisan register in peak beats: "dogmatic chains," "infinite questions blooming within," "restorations of the soul." Dialogue (one exchange) feels functional but carries no subtext; Lena's question is earnest exposition, Elias's reply is a deflection rather than goal-driven persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    POV distance stable but register is uniformly elevated across narration, Elias's interior, and Voss's dialogue: "warp at edges," "defiance guards itself," "verdant cipher" erase individual voice. Dialogue ("Gardens call, but skies reply") performs cryptic archetype without naturalism or subtext. Perceptual signature absent—every detail reads as authorial catalog rather than character-filtered attention. Filter verbs ("stood guard," "clasped") cluster in peak beats without immediacy. Diction drift into abstract philosophy ("collective thought evasion," "conceptual missive") violates the focalizer's plausible lexicon under crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person focalization through Elowen remains stable, and the lyric register is consistent. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated, abstract phrasing ("epochs of shy persistence," "pain's dark chlorophyll birthed galaxies of light") that distances the reader from concrete perception. The repetitive final third ("Joy shadowed by reefs," "Blossoms eternal," "Reef-shadow joy prevailed") flattens into template cadence without modulation under pressure. Filter verbs and participle openers cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Voice reads as ornamental rather than revealing character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elara's perception. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("foxglove regret," "opal library suspended above the roiling clouds"), creating a distinct lyric texture. However, register drifts into ornamental phrasing under pressure: "gently systematic precision," "deserted marvels," "ethereal method," and "poisonous bloom of sorrowful purpose" recur as template anchors rather than voice-specific modulation. Sentence stems repeat: "Elara lifted," "Elara repeated," "Elara sank," "Elara's heart." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the ending beat, flattening voice at closure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the lexicon leans toward aesthetic decoration over character-particular perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with access to Elara's interiority. Perceptual filter is consistent (arcane focus, fear of loss). However, diction repeatedly cycles through the prompt attributes—"carefully reckless," "cautious exuberance"—as refrains rather than varied embodiment, creating a template cadence. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Thorne's two lines carry subtext. The register occasionally elevates ("symphonies of truth," "ossified") in ways that fit the setting but flatten under peak pressure when embodied specificity would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt," "compassion armored against betrayal"—that strains against the machinist's practical lexicon. The elder's single line of dialogue, "Forged in mercy, hidden for such a time," carries distinct idiom, but Elias's interior voice blends prompt language ("harmonize conflicting values") with character-specific perception unevenly. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs and abstract phrasing dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature (Elias's obsessive mapping, pigeon-training lens) is present. Register drifts into elevated diction ("celestial score," "cosmic voids," "budding duet") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Lila's two lines of dialogue ("It's beautiful, like stars trapped in wind" and "You remapped everything") carry thematic echo rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Elias's interiority at peak beats (fraud accusation, final death) is summarized rather than rendered in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Diction is elevated and ornamental throughout ("featherly determined," "quill barbs etched in wind," "sanctity," "hush's true architecture"), creating consistent lyric distance but little perceptual signature specific to a lost child. Sentences often begin with abstract nouns or -ing participles, generating template cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The register remains uniformly poetic under both calm investigation and supposed climax, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable focalization on Elara, but diction drifts into ornamental register ("shadowseam wonder," "ethereal prisms," "luminous respite") that reads as authorial overlay rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Elara's single extended line about the feather as map feels expository rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance wavers between close embodiment and panoramic summary, especially in the atrium sequence where interior texture thins.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is consistent—lyric, image-dense, with a fanciful register ("merry dirge," "whimsical delight tinged with sorrow")—and the oxymoronic "cheerful gloom" idiom is sustained. However, the prose relies on decorative phrasing ("sea-foam aura," "laughter's hearth, solitude's song") that crowds perception without deepening interiority. Filter verbs and label-heavy constructions ("her motivation burned bright yet bittersweet") appear in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The voice is distinct but tilts toward ornament over embodied thought, and the final paragraph's summary narration ("She had uncovered the why") loses urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Jasper with clear psychic distance. Phrases like "lightly attentive," "calculated wilderness," and "by ordering randomness" recur as thematic refrains but edge toward prompt-echo rather than organic voice. Elara's interiority is summarized ("Floodgates burst: visions of summer nights") in a way that tells rather than shows her perception shift. The lanky man's dialogue ("Used to compose symphonies with these. Lost the spark in corporate drudgery") reads slightly expository. Perceptual signature is present (Jasper scanning crowd patterns) but not rhythmically varied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance fluctuates without purpose: "exile now felt eternal" tells emotion after showing panic, and "purpose fulfilled" asserts satisfaction without embodied cues. Diction drifts into elevated register ("diaphanous wings of tidal mist," "liquid starfire") that does not reflect Elara's practical dancer background. Kai's single line of dialogue ("Elara?") and his whispered reprise feel generic; no perceptual signature distinguishes his lens from hers in the brief balcony scene. Filter verbs ("she knew," "he gasped") cluster in the final third without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with a consistent elevated register. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract, prompt-adjacent language ("noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity," "reading between the lines") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. The prose lacks perceptual signature—Elias's way of noticing is generic poetic rather than shaped by his glazier's eye. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") are used conventionally and do not dull immediacy, but the voice converges with the thematic machinery rather than remaining character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elias's perceptual signature (fire vocabulary, tenderness filtered through scarred tissue) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable; Lena's "Please, mister" and Elias's gravelly tone carry age and power differential. However, diction elevates during reflection ("bargained my innocence," "slow celestial dance") in ways that feel authorial rather than firefighter-particular. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The phrase "gently skilled" repeats mechanically across three beats without variation, a minor template artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice is stable third-limited with elevated diction ("lucidly watchful," "serene upheaval," "sinuous lines") that matches a reflective, formal register. Perceptual signature leans abstract: Elara "sensed" timelines, "glimpsed" threads, "dreamed logically"—telling rather than showing distinct sensory filters. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains distant-omniscient rather than close; we are told her motivation burns fierce but do not inhabit the burn. Register holds consistently but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—peak moments ("grotto trembled softly," "light from ruptured timelines") carry the same syntactic tempo as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited and the perceptual signature (sonic attention, echo metaphors) is consistent. However, repeated phrase structures create a template cadence: "Elias + [verb]" openings, "the + [noun]" descriptors, and filter verbs ("he found," "he glimpsed") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mournful hum," "tentative forgiveness") that feels imposed rather than character-emergent. No head-hopping, and the voice is generally coherent, but the line-level uniformity and filter-stack reduce the grade and disallow 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: Elowen notices "every quiver," "faintly," "shimmering," without character-specific bias or selectivity. Diction converges into elevated register ("dusky harmony," "elusive," "grace," "perceptively calm") repeated as template modifiers rather than modulated voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Purposeful compression is not taught; the repeated adjectives read as decorative rather than pattern-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Diction drifts into elevated register ("operatively gentle," "flawed beauty," "celestial waltz") that exceeds the narrator's established lexicon and repeats as template phrases. The dialogue snippet ("To muster peace…") reads as thesis delivery rather than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is thin; Elara's interior does not show a distinct way of noticing under pressure. No head-hopping, but the voice feels generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent elevated register with purposeful compression ("amorality his shield," "fate's own blueprint"), but diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that exceeds Elias's plausible interiority under stress ("cruel artistry," "geologic time," "entropy"). POV remains stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature—corporate titan who weeps for fledglings—is character-specific. The piece teaches its lyric cadence early and holds it, but the syntax becomes formulaic: repeated "[Noun] [verb], [noun] [verb]" structures flatten rhythm in peak beats ("Thunder cracked nearer, promising deluge... Elias rose, sentimental tears salting..."). No dialogue present; evaluated for narration only.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but the voice is generic and relies on elevated register ("iambic flow," "sonnets," "haiku rhythm") that feels imposed rather than character-filtered. Elara's perceptual signature is absent; descriptions of snow and starlight could belong to any focalizer. The prose converges into purple-coded lyricism ("bodily poetic," "harvest of echoes") that obscures concrete action and flattens the narrative into tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "elegant script," "urbane," "silk scarf draped precisely." Diction remains consistent, leaning literary-poetic ("meteor hush," "ink-stained gloves"), though some phrases feel elevated beyond a calligrapher's natural idiom under stress ("subversive thrills; ethics bloomed in openness"). Purposeful compression ("Uncommonly serene, he led now toward light") supports the accumulative design. Free indirect style is clean. The voice is competent but not character-particular; lacks the specificity that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("esoteric realist," "lepidopteran lore," "fractal math," "Vector sums of wind and instinct") that exceeds the established perceptual signature. Elara's internal voice reads like thematic narration rather than embodied thought under pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]" opens seven consecutive beats in the middle third, flattening rhythm. Filter verbs ("watched," "knew") dull immediacy in high moments.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (artisan's eye, wax-caster metaphors) colors the narration consistently. Elara's lexicon ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") is distinctive but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("holographic voices chanting"). No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is controlled. The prose reflects her state under pressure (short clauses at the climax), but filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") dull immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose attempts a distinct texture via neologism and compression ("foresight hindsight only," "decaying directive"). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("walkers unwitting bearers of renewal," "boundless how") that reads as thematic narration rather than Elara's lived perception. The recursive phrasing ("precisely playful" appears five times, "ethereal grit" three times) creates a lyric cadence but also flattens momentum. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("Interpretations bloomed," "revelation grasped") distance the reader from immediate experience during the dream sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV remains third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between elevated register ("abyssal entity," "helical nebulae") and simpler beats without clear voice motivation, and perceptual signature is generic—Ezar notices star alignments and vines but his manner of noticing does not feel character-specific. Repeated template openings ("Ezar's heart quickened," "Ezar rose," "Ezar smiled") flatten rhythm. Under pressure (rift opening), syntax does not compress or sharpen. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable distance and no head-hopping. Voice is consistent but generic: "battle-hardened wanderer," "scheming pacifist," and template phrasing ("his eyes burning with," "his body remembering") flatten the texture. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("Elias knew," "Elias nodded," "Elias smiled," "Reality shifted"). The narrator's perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions read as neutral report rather than filtered through Elias's scheming mind or Thorne's resentful lens. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering setting through Elias's task-focused attention. Diction is elevated and lyric—"mountain of glass etched with precision," "pools of twilight frost"—but stays internally consistent and does not head-hop. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. However, perceptual signature is generic: any bereaved craftsman could narrate this way, and the prose does not shift rhythm or specificity under the peak synchronization beats. Purposeful compression at closure (breaths entwining, fog retreating) supports the accumulative lens without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative voice is stable third-limited on Elias with brief tight-third on Lila; no head-hopping. Dialogue feels goal-driven ("You persist in this madness, Father?" pursues confrontation; the ribbon and vow exchange advances plot). However, the prose leans on filtering and summary in key beats: "felt a surge to persist," "saw her own strength mirrored," "voice softening as leaves swirled." The "feisty" label recurs in narration rather than voice-specific perception, and Lila's interiority in the climax is cleaner and more articulate than stress would allow. Psychic distance shifts are intentional but compress emotional complexity into tidy realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction attempts a speculative-philosophical register ("liminal," "recursive gifts," "temporal waves") that fits the curatorial voice but occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("philosophical breakthroughs," "multidimensional engravings"). The perceptual signature—Elara's curatorial attention to artifacts and blossoms—is present but not selective under pressure. Dialogue with the luminous tree spirit is functional but brief and lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. Internal voice remains coherent but does not degrade or sharpen distinctively under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara, but voice lacks texture—sentences feel interchangeable and rely on elevated register ("arcane linguist," "threading through the vaulted stacks like a violin solo") that never modulates under pressure. Dialogue is functional but carries no subtext: characters announce their needs and solutions. The time traveler's "eyes wild with futures unborn" and "I've come from the unraveling" exemplify overwrought diction disconnected from embodied perception. Filter verbs stack in expository passages ("she'd long sought," "her mind already mapping"). Internal monologue is absent during problem-solving beats where we'd expect character-specific thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present (carnival imagery filtered through Elara's quest) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated or abstract register ("blissfully aberrant fusion," "unkindled solace") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The chimera twin's single line of dialogue ("We are recaptured") carries weight, but there is no sustained exchange to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (archivist's precision, humming folk tunes, "warmly methodical") is consistent. However, the final third fractures into self-conscious meta-commentary about word count and story bounds ("No, wait—798 words total… final seal: 792 words precisely"), which reads as unfinished draft artifact rather than purposeful narrative choice. This breaks the narrative stance at the closure beat, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on the Mapkeeper; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (reading cracks, tracing patterns) is consistent and profession-specific. However, the prose often drifts into elevated register ("petals of void to smother invading noise," "bloom of hush") that feels authorial rather than the Mapkeeper's lived idiom, especially under pressure. Diction remains steady but somewhat generic; the internal voice lacks strong rhythmic or syntactic particularity. No dialogue present, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") appear but are not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited. Diction is elevated and consistent ("retrocognitively blessed," "thistle-blown echo") but the register stays abstract-lyric throughout; under peak stress (storm, climb, ignition) the voice does not modulate or compress. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she saw") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices abstractions ("fractured visions," "spectral approval") rather than concrete, character-specific details.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with a distinct perceptual signature (stormlight, frost-etched memory, quill-embroidered robes). POV remains stable in third-limited with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("conjecture's key," "collective memory's embrace") that abstracts rather than grounds perception, especially under emotional pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she imagined") stack in several beats without voice-motivated necessity. Syntax becomes rhythmically uniform across the shadow-reading sequence, flattening propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature (fire, sparks, ambient hush) is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates—"pyrotechnic dreams," "ethereal," "radiant defiance"—beyond what a weary wanderer's interiority would generate mid-task. The chants add rhythmic texture but repeat syntactic templates ("Twirl and burn," "Filter the gloom," "Spin the knot") without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in the mosaic-discovery beat without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV is stable, and Elaron's perceptual signature—phosphorescent waves, tangential observation—is distinct and maintained under pressure. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("fragmented skies trapped in eternity," "time's tactile quality"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into over-articulated interiority ("the core concept that haunted her," "transition periods devour us") that reads more like theme delivery than lived thought. Mira's brief dialogue carries subtext, but the final exchange feels expository rather than indirect.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature (collector's focus on silences, claustrophobic spatial wariness) is consistent. Diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("xenial," "intangibly tangible") that reads voice-motivated rather than generic. The fragmentary final paragraphs ("Porcelain gleamed. / Clouds parted.") teach a pattern of compression that mirrors her emotional release. No dialogue to judge; filter verbs ("she thought," "feeling") appear but remain controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice is afflicted by ornamental diction ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical," "catalyzed the shift") that drifts into elevated register inconsistent with scene urgency. Dialogue is sparse and functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Perceptual signature is generic; Elias narrates his own demonstration without internal texture or contradictory filter. The prose reads as authored explanation rather than lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register mismatched to live perception under pressure: "futuristic nostalgia enveloped her," "miracle pocket of the past," "molting skin," "shattering rainbows," "weave a canopy that whispered windsongs." Psychic distance oscillates between tight interior and distant catalog without purposeful modulation. Filter verbs ("she murmured," "she deciphered") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy. No distinct perceptual signature; the narrator's way of noticing reads generic cyberpunk-fantasy rather than character-particular. Single line of dialogue does not reveal subtext or pursue a goal.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (shadows as charges, memories as visions) is character-specific. Diction remains elevated throughout ("writhing shadows," "gossamer," "ironweed"), consistent with the voice but verging on uniform lyricism that does not modulate under peak pressure. Free indirect access to interiority is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The line "her grasp like ironweed around his throat" and "her needs devouring light until shadows fled" show metaphorical specificity, but the prose converges into a single register across emotional beats, flattening urgency. Purposeful compression is evident, yet the rhythmic and lexical range is narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent in register—elevated, concept-dense, lyric—but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature; Elias notices in generic poetic terms ("shadowseam wonder," "liquid starfire") rather than through idiom shaped by his history. Free indirect style is attempted but blurs into third-person omniscience that summarizes his state ("his motivation burned pure") without rendering his exact thought. Diction climbs into abstract philosophical register ("manifested ideas," "quantum flux") that feels authorial rather than rooted in a reformed con-artist's mind. Purposeful compression is present, but the piece does not teach a pattern early enough to justify the density; the reader infers lyricism rather than being guided into it.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between poetic register ("eloquently silent," "bridge of intuition") and near-Victorian flourish ("dynasty ender," "scepter of reckoning") without a consistent internal texture. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "mused") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices in the same elevated idiom throughout, with no degradation under stress. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and the elevated diction ("endless night," "molten glass," "ecstatic thrill") establishes a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is generic fantasy idiom rather than character-specific—Elowen's way of noticing (sigils, sap, luminous paths) could belong to any withdrawn knight in a mystical orchard. The prose attempts purposeful compression ("shivering bliss," "factually mystical") as recurring motifs, but the pattern feels decorative rather than taught-and-paid-off. Psychic distance remains stable, and no dialogue appears to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Eleanor's perception throughout. Diction matches the period and her educated archivist role: "fragile paper trails," "tactfully hopeful," "weary sentinels." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the discovery sequence. However, rhythmic control slips in the final third with repeated "she" + past-tense verb stems ("She imagined," "She transcribed," "She would seek") that flatten propulsion. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("velvet sky," "latent rebellion," "prismatic signals of solidarity") that fits a lyric-situational design but often tips into overwriting—figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the lagoon sequence without variation in intensity. Holographic Lena's dialogue ("the map called you true") feels archaic rather than character-specific, and Joren's line ("Underestimated you, we did") inverts syntax for no voice-motivated reason. Psychic distance remains stable, and there's no head-hopping, but the compression of Elias's journey (boots splashing, drones evaded, lagoon reached) sacrifices embodied perception for summary momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("eerie nostalgia," "quietly vivid," "vested hush") but often defaults to prompt-label recycling rather than character-particular perception. Psychic distance holds steady. Perceptual signature is present (music, mist, memory) but not idiosyncratic under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a lyric texture, but register occasionally drifts into corporate abstraction ("imposing a vested hush," "negative space") that sits uneasily with the saxophonist's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent (Lir's orderly cataloging, his "mossy delight"). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that clashes with the focalizer's grounded task ("verdant haven suspended amid swirling ash clouds," "prophecy's own script") without voice motivation. Dialogue with the sylph is functional but lacks subtext or resistance—lines advance plot mechanically ("Tell me the message") rather than pursuing conflicting goals. Recycled sentence stems and template cadence appear in the middle third ("Each structure... served as a key," "Out fluttered... no longer dust but..."), flattening rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent contemplative register anchor the narration. Diction choices like "uncertainly certain" and "befriend uncertainty in planning" recur as motifs but risk label-speak rather than dramatized perception. The perceptual signature—Elias filtering through gears, springs, and tools—remains distinct. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (zooming in on the compass rose, widening for the waterfall's roar). Minor filter-verb reliance ("his heart raced") is acceptable within voice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("factually mystical," "verifiable astral force," "kintsugi intentions") mixes elevated register with lexical oddities that feel ornamental rather than voice-specific. Rhythmic control is present in the opening and closing, but mid-story beats rely on template cadence: "She began by… She withdrew… Gathering resolve, she mixed…" The final dialogue ("Its weight is ours to bear, beautifully") reads more polished than earned stress would allow. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she had named") stack in expository beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("luminous ache," "treacherous wilds," "mournful chorus"). However, register often drifts into ornamental poeticism that feels distant from embodied perception—Elara's interiority is more abstract mood than character-particular thought. Harlan's spectral dialogue ("I laughed while the blade fell...") is vivid, but Elara's responses are narrated rather than voiced, missing an opportunity for distinct idiom. The narrative voice is consistent but tonally uniform, with limited modulation under pressure; peak beats maintain the same elevated, melancholic register as quieter moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("proprioceptively enhanced," "ultraviolet penance," "fractal convergence") that reads consistent but not character-particular—more concept than lived voice. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks perceptual signature; her noticing is filtered through abstract terminology rather than selective bias. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt," "remembering") appear frequently but voice-motivated, so no major penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.4)
    POV distance is inconsistent: "eternal instant" implies lyric suspension, yet the narrator also provides linear backstory and omniscient summary ("the city below pulsed unknowingly"). Diction drifts into elevated register unmotivated by Elara's interior voice ("infinitesimal maps of vanished routes," "holographic annals onto the market's mist"). Perceptual signature is generic—no character-particular way of noticing. Purposeful compression is attempted ("between childhood and now") but not taught as a pattern; the piece alternates between summary and present scene without clear anchoring cues, creating orientation debt rather than lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately (tight on Theo's observations, slight zoom for ghost memories). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("weightless burden," "unraveling wire," "clocked out"), with purposeful compression in the dust-pattern analysis. The vision sequence ("memories flooded Theo's mind") shifts into summary mode, softening immediacy at a peak beat. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "Who hides above?") and functional. Perceptual signature is clear—Theo notices dust, cracks, mechanical details—though the filter "his eyes tracing" and similar constructions occasionally dull directness.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with a distinct texture ("negotiable reality," "cartography of chaos") and purposeful compression in the final third. Perceptual signature is thin—Elias's way of noticing feels interchangeable with the narrator's rather than character-particular. The piece teaches its lyric, fragment-driven pattern by the final quarter and holds it through closure, so purposeful elision is acceptable. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("rustling awakenings," "negotiable void") that feels more decorative than anchored in Elias's lived interiority, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent baroque register ("burnished sorrow," "iambic schemes," "perpetual melancholy") that suits the setting and Elias's poetic inclination. However, the elevated diction never modulates under peak pressure; even during the storm-swept climax, syntax remains ornate and uniform. Psychic distance stays stable, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—Elias's way of noticing doesn't shift between planning and action. The line "forcing scholars to rebuild the narrative from fragments alone" tells rather than shows the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias, but perceptual signature is thin—his way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. Diction drifts into elevated register ("transmutative fire," "vengeful bloom," "infinitesimally adjusted") that feels authorial rather than voice-motivated for a repairman. Dialogue is absent, so voice is tested only in narration; the prose texture is consistent but not distinctive. Filter verbs and expository phrasing ("He knew the covenant's attribute well") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but diction drifts into elevated abstractions inconsistent with a laid-off factory worker ("sensibly eccentric logic," "communion with the place," "hinged enlightenments"). Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices in catalog fashion without character-specific bias. Key moments are narrated as summary ("Awakening cascaded") rather than immediate experience. No dialogue. The final staccato fragments ("But wait, deeper callings lingered") break the established rhythm without voice-motivated purpose and read as generation artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose suffers from recycled sentence stems and looped phrasing: "perpetually learning" appears six times, "turbine-hum reverie" four times, "spirited" thrice, creating template cadence. Elara's interior voice is consistent but not character-particular, reading more like elevated narration than a sculptor's mind under pressure. Mira and Kai's brief dialogue ("We carve not against the sea...") sounds interchangeable with the narrator's register.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with grounded action: "umbral tenderness," "nocturnal embrace," "vivid testaments to petals that shunned the sun." Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices beauty and mystery in identical lyric cadence throughout, with no character-specific bias or blind spot. Filter verbs and summary interiority dominate: "she reckoned," "she knew," "Elara understood," externalizing thought rather than inhabiting it. No dialogue appears. The final third recycles sentence stems ("Elara rose," "Elara breathed," "Elara sealed") without variation, flattening rhythm under what should be peak emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, and the register aspires to heightened, antiquarian diction ("veils of time," "mist and unresolved grievances"). However, perceptual signature is generic across beats—every object receives equal lyric treatment—and psychic distance never modulates. The prose often slips into exposition that tells rather than anchors in Elias's concrete perception ("his motivation to pierce the tension," "demanding parley for the truths he sought"). Filter verbs ("he knew," "he absorbed") stack in the final third without voice-motivated justification, applying −0.5 in Q7 that bleeds here as distance flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice remains consistent and elevated, with purposeful compression ("uncorked his mind like a volatile elixir") and patterned diction that teaches a lyric register early. However, the prose converges on a single syntactic template: declarative statements stacked without modulation under pressure. Psychic distance is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices alchemical abstractions rather than character-specific details. No dialogue appears; interior monologue consists of thematic assertions rather than contradictory thoughts acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (archival focus, dead-language fluency). Register drifts into elevated diction throughout ("velvet disquiet," "hypnotic grace," "serendipitous marriage of relic, memory, and rite") that feels authorial rather than Elias-particular, especially under the pressure of prophecy. The childhood flashback integrates smoothly via anchor cue, but the prose texture does not modulate with emotional intensity—ornamental phrasing persists in peak beats (prophecy moment, final vow) where compression would sharpen urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (seed-saver lexicon: "botanical relics," "heart-tree," "genetic precision") but diction drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "furiously tranquil guardian of time's heirlooms," "the gritty silk of moments pilfered from infinity." Oxymoronic phrases ("furious tranquility," "serene fury," "wild serenity") repeat without modulation under pressure, flattening rather than intensifying voice. Filter verbs are sparse. Narrative distance is consistent but lacks embodied texture in peak beats—Elara's perception during the vortex plunge is told in lyric abstraction ("viscous as honeyed fog") rather than immediate sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elias's perceptual signature (tracking gauges, straining to hear beyond wind) is consistent. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("credibly curious spirit," "profound solstice hush," "curiosity aflame") that reads more like external commentary than Elias's lived idiom under pressure. Psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose: intimate moments ("heart steady") alternate with distant declarations ("he was guardian of the solstice's profound truth"). Reflection dominates the second half, telling us Elias's creed rather than showing him test it with embodied cost. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("primal elegance of a shadow given form," "life's elegy," "flourishing stillness") that clashes with Elias's concrete janitorial context. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt," "he glimpsed") stack in peak beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the narrator's lens could belong to any cosmic contemplator. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent ("tranquilly perceptive," wind whispers, lightplay on dunes) but reliant on repeated stock phrases: "mute eloquence" (×3), "tranquilly perceptive/perceived" (×4), "contextual clues" (×3), "astonishment/astonished" (×3). These label-only tics flatten voice particularity and read as template cadence rather than a singular rhythm. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("nascent buzz," "veiled life") without clear motivation. No dialogue is present. The repetitive stems and stock modifiers violate the loop/scaffold screen, warranting deduction in Q7 as well, but voice convergence under pressure lowers Q6 independently.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains a lyric-experimental register with purposeful compression ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "anticipated mysteries," "time's fibrous grain") and teaches its pattern early. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—time-sensitive, grief-soaked—remains character-specific. However, peak moments lean on elevated diction ("silken drags of dawns, gritty rasps of midnights") that edges toward thesaurus-itis without deepening embodied perception. No second character appears, so dialogue and voice-distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("burnished hush," "petrichor," "cobalt depths") but tilts toward decorative lyricism that reads as writerly rather than character-particular; Elias's perceptual signature is indistinct from the narrative voice. Repeated phrases ("warmly attentive," "by harmonizing discord") function as thematic markers rather than rhythmic variation. No dialogue appears; the piece maintains tonal coherence but lacks the textural specificity or modulation under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance is static—Elias's perception never modulates under stress or terminal illness, and interiority relies on trait labels ("gently systematic," "brazen calm") recycled across beats. Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a caretaker's lexicon: "architectural secrets," "arboreal entities," "fostering respect," "conceptual repricing" read as authorial rather than voice-motivated. The prose carries a uniform cadence that does not shift with urgency; dying and dawn, wiring and visions, all flow at the same stately tempo. Minimal dialogue—three brief lines—precludes testing subtext or character voice distinction. Psychic distance stays fixed in summary-reflective mode, never zooming into embodied immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV (Elara) is stable; focalization remains consistent. Diction, however, leans heavily into elevated register ("luminous skepticism," "bronze-quiet," "volatile esters for launch grief") that reads more authorial than Elara's plausible idiom under pressure. Dialogue (Kai, Mira) is brief and functional but lacks subtext or character-specific rhythm. Perceptual signature exists—Elara notices chemistry, footprints, data—but the prose does not modulate texture under stress; peak beats maintain the same ornamented cadence as exposition, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne throughout. The narrative voice carries elevated, archaic diction ("scarred by forgotten wars," "desperate finger tracing infinity") that reads voice-motivated for a fantasy coachman but occasionally tips into purple register ("ink-black sea," "quiet conquest"). Perceptual signature is generic; Thorne's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Dialogue is absent. The phrase "narrow vastness" recurs but feels imposed rather than organically woven into perception. Minor filter-verb stacks ("gripped," "whispered," "watched") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias. However, diction drifts into poetic abstraction ("wild hush," "intuitively descriptive," "tinted") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue (Harlan, Mira) is brief and functional but lacks distinct idiom—Harlan's "Folks whisper" and Mira's "Tinted revelations, love" sound equally elevated. The prose substitutes lyric register for perceptual signature; under peak stress (the reunion), syntax doesn't compress or shift to reflect urgency. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") are minimal, a strength, but voice reads as authorial rather than Elias-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara, and the perceptual signature (temporal stretch, her "gift" of sensing direction) is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("eternities," "echoed triumphs," "defiance of pariah's fate") that clashes with the embodied immediacy the scene demands. The final third accelerates into sentence fragments and repetitive stems ("True north called again. She followed. Word count pulsed...") that flatten voice rather than intensify it.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and the prose maintains a high-fantasy register with clear focalization on Elarion throughout. However, diction leans on repeated stock phrases ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful," "chivalrous thief") that feel like prompt echoes rather than organic character idiom, especially under peak stress. Filter verbs and embedded exposition ("his apprenticeship taught him wonder's subtle arts—intuition over incantation") flatten immediacy. Dialogue with the Arbiter is brief and functional but carries minimal subtext; the exchange restates theme rather than advancing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is dense and elevated, with a consistent lexicon of abstraction ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "susurrus"). Register remains stable, but the diction—while lyrical—sometimes floats above concrete perception; phrases like "benevolently ruthless purpose" and "archive luminous against history's void" read as thematic labels rather than Thorne's embodied thought. POV is single and controlled, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but filtered through a heightened, almost allegorical lens that risks distancing the reader from visceral interiority. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into register that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived perception ("mercury-glass seer," "verdant valleys—her home's shadow"). Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. The prose has a distinct lyric texture, but the syntactic patterns (long, clause-heavy sentences) become uniform and slow momentum during action sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, ornamental register that clashes with immediate scene pressure: "profound woven hush," "fierce repose," "platinum chamber holding a mirror...of unvarnished truth." Perceptual signature is present (chess metaphors, pawn-twisting), but voice texture flattens under pressure rather than modulating naturally. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he realized") appear at key turns without clear voice motivation, and the final paragraph's summary ("tutor to his own redemption, through corridors no longer labyrinthine") reads as authorial gloss rather than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature ("paint-smeared fingers," "silken hook" voice) is established early. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("forged hush," "spectral halos," "prismatic words") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially under stress. Dialogue from the crowd is generic and interchangeable; no character beyond Elara speaks with distinct idiom. The narrative occasionally tells what Elara orchestrates ("Innocently mischievous, she orchestrated chaos with giggles") rather than showing it through action and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but psychic distance wavers: the narrator alternates between close embodiment ("lungs burning," "vision blurring") and detached summary ("His mind quilted the fragment together"). Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis urgency ("intentions quilted solitude into strength," "spidering out"). The alchemist's perceptual signature is generic—no distinct idiom or selectivity beyond "uncertain" labels. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") and abstract nominalizations ("intentions," "enchantment") dull immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's nostalgic, painterly perception ("salty breezes carried whispers," "lanterns flickering like dying stars," "veined with quartz that shimmered like captured memories"). Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent with an artist's sensibility, though at peak beats the register occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("intimately aloof no longer") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Perceptual signature is present (visual and painterly focus on light, color, texture), and the pace modulates from studio reflection to descent to oasis discovery. No dialogue. The phrase "temporary eternity" appears twice as a thematic anchor, which reads intentional rather than accidental, but the final paragraph's overt thematic statement ("to reveal the truth of nostalgia") momentarily breaks the immersive POV to deliver a meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly to Elias without head-hopping; psychic distance remains stable. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register at peak beats: "vibrations of intent," "crystalline vibrations that pierced the veil of doubt," "invisible thread." Mira's single line of dialogue—"You... whispered?"—feels functional rather than character-specific, and the prose leans heavily on filter verbs ("he felt it leave him") and conceptual abstractions that dull immediacy during the story's emotional crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure. The voice carries a poetic, elevated register ("mosaic of old burns," "foxfire," "patina gleam") that suits Elias's role as navigator but occasionally drifts into writerly diction ("fluctuations syncing with the lunar swell"). Dialogue is minimal (phone voices) and voice-distinct ("frame the base," "twist left under gibbous"). One deduction: filter verbs ("watched," "lingered") and passive constructions ("was meant to amplify") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is consistent but abstract, favoring metaphor over sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register throughout, but diction frequently drifts into ornamental abstraction ("shards of fractured grace," "elegies to lost illusions," "silken deceit") that obscures immediate action. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Elias's lies to Lira and Thom read naturally. However, the narrative voice does not modulate under pressure—peak moments (the insertion, the first test) carry the same lyric density as exposition, flattening urgency. Perceptual signature is vague; Elias's way of noticing (via sensors and probes) is asserted but not shown in sensory selectivity during the ritual or descent.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with distinct perceptual signature ("salvaged oddities," "ghost ships that never docked"). Psychic distance contracts appropriately during the memory-touch moment. Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-motivated for an eccentric keeper who reads washed-up journals. Minor register drift: "decode," "probe the absences," "method that had unraveled many a wreck's secret" flirts with abstracting the investigation into meta-commentary rather than embodied action. The phrase "the method" arrives without prior establishment, creating a brief filter. Rhythm varies purposefully, compressing at the stranger's plunge and expanding during reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited focalization through Elias without head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("cartographic ghosts," "empirically intuitive clarity," "rhythmic underscore to renewal") that sits uneasily with a lonely map dealer's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak—his "mapmaker's cipher" eye is told more than shown in selective noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction drifts into elevated ornament ("spilled mercury," "lacy menace," "deceptive delicacy") that clashes with the claimed urgency and flattens perceptual specificity. Elowen's interior voice lacks a distinct rhythm or bias; her thoughts read as narrated summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Thorne's single line of dialogue is functional but generic. Register inconsistency is most visible in the final descent: "power woven in menace as fine as lace" and "destiny's sharp pattern" slide into abstract poeticism that distances rather than intensifies the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    Single-POV focalization holds cleanly with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, jargon-dense registers ("logarithmic grace," "solar spectrometry," "relational gravity") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. Thorne's single line of dialogue is distinct, but Lirien's voice in both speech and narration recycles abstract prompt labels. Perceptual signature is generic; under peak pressure the prose does not compress or shift rhythm in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct, lyric-inflected narrative texture ("weeds choking the headstone," "moon's indifferent grin"). Elara's perceptual signature—chronologically confused, weary, self-envious—shapes what she notices. Yet the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("chronologically confused," "feral nostalgia") that reads more like writerly shorthand than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. The compression and patterned imagery (cabin → flight → return) are purposeful, but the voice does not sharpen or degrade noticeably under peak stress, flattening the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and consistent ("occluded views," "maps emotional terrain," "trembling calm"), establishing a distinct narrative texture. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—Elara's professional lens on the screw and mechanism is clear, but her interior voice ("humanize the machine," "unveil the story") often drifts into abstract statement rather than character-specific perception. The final meta-commentary ("Wait, must fit count—story closes") breaks immersion and reads as scaffold artifact, harming voice control in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The prose texture is elevated and voice-consistent ("saturated hush," "velvet drone," "prismatic shards") with purposeful compression. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("invoked the quill's latent magic," "compelling the scar to narrate its birth") that reads slightly external to immediate perception under stress. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is consistent but the narrative distance stays neutral rather than character-particular in word choice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent and lyric-inflected ("gossip-column exorcist," "ethereal grit," "rivers carving stone"), but the dense figurative register flattens under pressure: every beat receives metaphorical dressing ("fog to the orchard's roots," "blight in your score") that obscures rather than sharpens character perception. Dialogue feels performative—"Forgive the girl who pruned your branches for headlines"—rather than goal-driven. POV is stable, but the prose reads more like narrated performance than lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.3)
    Voice is consistently elevated but generic: "resounding hush," "whispered their last breaths into oblivion," "eternities flashed." Diction remains uniform across emotional registers—Elowen murmurs, intones, and savors without perceptual signature or character-specific syntax. Psychic distance is stable but the prose reads as committee mysticism rather than a singular focalizer's way of noticing. Purposeful compression is attempted but the pattern (inward/outward parallelism) becomes mechanical without teaching a payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (shepherd metaphor, technical detail filtered through Elias's expertise) is consistent. Diction fits the character's register ("herding their intricate gears," "temporal pastures"), though some phrases ("eminently peculiar") recur mechanically. The voice modulates appropriately during the key sequence, with shorter syntax under pressure. However, template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun]..." openings and "Elias [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs, creating rhythmic monotony. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood") cluster at closure without dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single third-person POV remains stable, and the narration carries a distinct lyric texture ("clover melancholy," "rainwashed gleam," "mica pane diffusing a warm, flickering glow"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elena filters the world through probability and her father's shadow—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("embodying lucid contradictions," "quantum superpositions") that feels more authorial than character-particular. The patterned recurrence of prompt phrases ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions," "traverse," "midsummer," "clover melancholy") creates a slight template cadence that flattens voice under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV (Elias) holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Distance is stable and the perceptual signature—tunnel sounds, disc spins, damp air—roots the voice in his obsessive frame. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Wrong number?" / "Some wires fray for a reason") with subtext in his evasions. However, Mira's final lines ("I get it now—your lesson. Goodbye, booth man; hello, my real life") read as thesis articulation rather than voice-particular speech under stress, and Elias's interior remains abstract ("to teach endings how to begin") rather than rhythmically embodied. No filter-verb stacks or major POV leakage, but the voice does not modulate distinctly under peak pressure—Elias smiles into the dark with the same gravelly calm he maintains throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and closely tied to Elara's archival perspective. Diction is controlled and purposefully elevated ("inexorable pull," "viscous brew," "vapor-shapes"). Sensory filtering reflects her priorities (ink, petals, photo). However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("context changes," "proximate causes") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, and the phrase "haunted euphoria" recurs as a label rather than modulating under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but could be more distinctly hers.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds Elias as focal character with stable distance and consistent narrative stance. Voice carries a faintly elevated, lyric register ("eerie dusk when old tales twist," "electric exchange") that remains coherent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's line and Elias's quips pursue goals (offering scones, defusing doubt). Weakness: the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("He believed it embodied reciprocity") that tells motive rather than showing it through on-page micro-choices, and the narration's certainty about community emotion ("loneliness fractured") exceeds what one focalizer can plausibly know.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (ultrasonic absorption through skin) is consistent. However, diction inflates under pressure: "threads of forgotten dreams," "unresolved chords," "quiet blaze," "restrained fire"—poetic but generic, not character-particular. The introspective register remains uniform across urgency shifts (kneeling to press soil vs. standing at the pool). Psychic distance never tightens or widens purposefully; emotional peaks receive the same elevated literary treatment as transit beats. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "absorbed") are acceptable as sensory anchors but stack without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the voice attempts a lyric-scientific register ("thresh," "contingent relationships," "exotic nib") that fits a celestial interpreter. However, the diction becomes formulaic: "confidently uncertain" appears three times, "contingent relationships" twice, "thresh meaning" in nearly every paragraph, creating a template cadence rather than a perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she decided," "she gazed") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as committee consensus—elevated but generic—rather than a singular mind under pressure, and Elara's perceptual bias (what she notices, how she interprets) is not character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Finn without head-hopping. Diction oscillates between lyric registers ("feather-light murmur," "liquid moonlight") and template cadence ("her eyes narrowed with purpose," "her hands beginning the mapping"). Elara's whisper-and-sign dialogue is mechanically described rather than rendered with distinct rhythm or subtext. The prose asserts "quietly charismatic" and "joyful sorrow" rather than letting gesture and silence create those impressions. Distance remains stable, but voice lacks a perceptual signature specific to Finn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (pattern recognition, grief-driven focus) colors her observations. Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "fingers entwined like roots in ancient soil" establishing a lyric register. However, during peak emotional beats—discovering the portrait, entering the vault—the prose shifts into declarative summary ("tears carving paths," "tenderness exploding") that tells emotion rather than inhabiting it through syntax or rhythm. No dialogue appears on the page. Psychic distance stays controlled, but the voice leans heavily on metaphor in every paragraph, creating a uniform texture that flattens rather than modulates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and purposeful in establishing voice, but register drifts into elevated, near-purple phrasing ("velvet shroud," "mournful spears," "spectral arms") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Kai's single line of dialogue ("You came") is functional but lacks distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is present in the drumming focus but syntactic patterns repeat: "She [verb]" openers and stacked participial phrases create mechanical cadence. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("began drumming") appear frequently without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited holds steady with Elias as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (identifies walks, notices storm effects on sound) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geomagnetic frenzy," "calculated spontaneity") that sits uneasily with a maintenance worker's interior voice. Dialogue from Harlan ("Bet this Aries-tailed relic on a challenge") feels stage-managed rather than natural. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("his legend echoed softly, eternally") breaks the established close distance, summarizing triumph rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV anchors to Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout—"spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "celestial fire"—creating a stable, purposeful voice. However, register remains uniformly ornate even in high-pressure beats, flattening emotional modulation. Elara's perceptual signature (silent guardian, water-sworn) is consistent but does not degrade or sharpen under stress. Filter verbs ("sensing," "conveyed") appear frequently without voice-motivated necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    Psychic distance is consistent third-limited, and the prose attempts a lyric register with phrases like "mist...clung like forgotten regrets" and "pages rustling like breaths held too long." However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("nascent forests of reflection," "prophecy fulfilled") that exceeds the scene's urgent demands and flattens Elias's perceptual signature. Purposeful compression is present but not taught early; the reader must infer the pattern retrospectively. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The voice reads as authorial rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elara. Voice attempts a lyric register ("ocean's shallow embrace," "hearts guarded tighter than barnacle-crusted hulls") but the elevated diction often clashes with the urgency of peak beats. Dialogue in the tavern carries subtext but the phrasing ("You're too graceful for this muck, Elara—like a seal in boots") and the confession ("I ache for the sea's wild call, not this tethered life") read as thesis statements rather than naturalistic speech under stress. The prose layers metaphor densely throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, and filter verbs ("she gasped," "tears welled") dull immediacy at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual filtering through the performer's grief-performance frame. Diction ("titans," "sift through voids," "carve of inevitability") sustains a heightened, theatrical register that matches the character's soliloquy habit, though the elevated idiom occasionally drifts into prompt-template phrasing ("emotional void," "morally ambiguous") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. Rhythmic control is strong in the whittling beats, and the compressed final image ("hush remade once more") modulates effectively. No dialogue is present; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (aesthetic vocabulary, focus on light and texture) but not character-particular—diction drifts into elevated register ("otherworldly light," "profound knowing," "aesthetic audacity") that reads ornamental rather than voice-specific. Psychic distance is inconsistent: "A tremor of certainty quivered through him then, absolute and unyielding" tells certainty rather than showing its embodied effect. Free indirect style is attempted but filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("his motivation burned," "his form flickering") dull immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elias as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice texture is present in phrases like "colorblind eyes squinting at silhouettes" and "innocently cunning ploy forming," but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("Victorian florigraphy evolved here into something rawer") that sits uneasily with Elias's tactile, immediate perception. Dialogue (Mira's two lines) is functional but minimal. The climactic beats rely on summary ("He had glimpsed its power before") rather than immediate sensory pressure, softening the POV's embodied grip during peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "golden shadows," "prism-song," "texture" recur without character-specific bias. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, with no modulation under pressure—crisis vocabulary matches calm. Figurative density is high and consistent, teaching a pattern, but at peak beats ("pain lanced her") the prose remains abstract rather than embodied. The phrase "powerfully gentle" recurs as a label without syntactic enactment. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy—it could belong to any archivist of lost sounds.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice maintains elevated register throughout ("subdued ardor," "nexuses where intention could coax life from dormancy"), but diction clashes with the focalizer's grief-state—no compression or breakdown under emotional pressure. Perceptual signature is generic poetic catalog rather than character-specific noticing shaped by jeweler's expertise or mourning. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Distance remains stable but psychic intimacy is shallow; interiority is assertion ("spark ignited") rather than sensory-specific thought texture.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchors cleanly to Elara; Theo's interiority appears only through reported speech and embodied cues. The prose texture is consistent—elevated, pattern-conscious, with recurring motifs (rain beads, onyx, measure)—and diction matches the protagonist's archival, occult-inflected worldview. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Elara, I need to confide something"; "Show me the letter"), carrying subtext of desperation and shared legacy. However, several lines veer toward ornamental register without pressure payoff: "skylight's patter," "fever dreams," "steadily curious fingers adjusting a path's angle by one degree" repeats the attribute label mechanically. The perceptual signature is present but occasionally smoothed by explanatory summary ("mesmerized," "heart quickened") rather than immediate sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but voice is generic high-fantasy register ("shadowed vaults," "fleeting regrets," "fractured obelisks") without character-specific perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated metaphor at every turn ("frozen scream of light," "quantum dance," "whirlwind of chaotic insight") with no variation under pressure. Free indirect access to Elara's thoughts remains surfacy ("heart pounding in anguished joy") and relies on label-only emotion. The phrase "anguished joy" recurs five times as a stock descriptor rather than evolving through embodied perception. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("softly deliberate," "luminous regret"), fitting the ethereal library setting. However, the prose often converges on a single register of poetic abstraction ("petals of memory unfurling," "hope's shape demanded preservation") that flattens emotional peaks. Elara's perceptual signature is not distinct—her way of noticing reads as generic narration rather than character-particular filtering. The video-comparison paragraph shifts to expository summary without interior coloring, and repeated stems ("The library," "Elara," "She") create rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; distance is consistent and the perceptual signature (tender wildlife handler noticing scales, creatures, healing tools) is character-specific. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional elevation ("ethereal calm," "unbreakable mosaic") drifts toward poetic summary. The phrase "quietly vivid" recurs as descriptor but does not modulate under pressure. No dialogue appears. Interior reflection dominates, anchored to present stimuli (the chameleon, the tail tip), but the voice occasionally slips into therapeutic clarity ("self-respect its guardian") that feels over-articulated for mid-crisis thought.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is lyric and densely metaphorical ("meteor hush," "verdant rustle," "scar-thirst"), creating a distinct texture, but the register remains consistently elevated even during physical action (tunneling, bleeding). POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization on Elena. However, the prose occasionally slips into exposition that tells rather than inhabits her perception—"convinced that true endings hid in the raw edges of scars" reads like summary rather than thought-in-motion. The plants' telepathic voices are differentiated by italics and verdant diction, but Elena's internal voice doesn't modulate meaningfully under the physical stress of digging.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("spatially imaginative," "emulsions yielded Eliza's script," "midwifed revelation") but registers as authorial ornament rather than Elara's thought texture under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (spatial mapping, crystal gazer's vision) yet the prose does not shift rhythm or vocabulary when stakes rise. The opening lines anchor voice, and the final image ("smiled into the beam") closes cleanly. Filter verbs ("visualized," "touching them triggered cascade") are acceptable but stack without urgency. Distance is controlled, but voice lacks character-specific idiom that would distinguish this narrator from a generic lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("shadowed rapture," "spectral embrace"), but the prose lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Key phrases ("unspoken words," "shadowed rapture") recur without shifting meaning, and the narrative distance is uniform across emotional peaks, missing modulation under stress. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("She learned," "she knew") flatten immediacy in pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent and lyric-specific, with purposeful compression and patterned diction ("occasionally everywhere," "wave functions hum approval"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close interiority to wider declarative at closure). Non-standard punctuation and fragments are pattern-taught and legible. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("wave functions coiling like smoke," "essence smeared across probabilities") that sits at the edge of the guard's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is present but somewhat generic for a "dreamless" figure; his noticing is more conceptual than sensorily particular. Rhythmic control is strong, but the recursive sentence stems ("He + action," "Sparks + verb," "The dune + state") create mild template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is ornate and consistent but leans heavily on elevated register ("cloistered thinker," "petrified psyche," "verdant chaos") that risks distancing the reader from immediate perception. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains stable, but diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("rote logic," "wild frontier") at peak beats when embodied sensation would sharpen urgency. The prose is distinctive but prioritizes texture over momentum, and the narrator's perceptual signature remains generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and generic ("rhythmic murmur matching the shoreline's lullaby," "essence," "crystallizing") without character-specific texture. Dialogue from the guides is interchangeable and expository ("Direct paths bind tighter than any leash"). The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular perspective. Filter verbs ("sensed," "urged") appear frequently but remain voice-neutral. No distinct rhythm under pressure; syntax stays uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias, but diction drifts into elevated register ("seraphically mundane," "balletic precision," "voiceless aria of regret") that clashes with the protagonist's embodied, regenerating interiority. The single line of dialogue ("I understand") is functional but generic. The archive-log memory flood is a POV breach—Elias accesses Thorne's history with unwarranted certainty, and the passage narrates Thorne's past choices ("fearing job loss, exile") as omniscient fact rather than inference. Rhythmic control is inconsistent; lyric compression in early beats gives way to expository summary in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Lirion. Perceptual signature ("dust motes hung eternal," "constellations' pause") is distinctive, but diction often drifts into elevated register ("titanic essence forged in the world's dawn," "temporal snare") that edges toward narrator assistance rather than Lirion's lived voice. Free indirect style is clean, yet the prose favors abstraction ("tectonic intent," "verity's quiet triumph") over embodied immediacy. Rhythm supports atmosphere but flattens under peak pressure—"truths cascaded" and "banners fell" read summary rather than dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic ("bone under relentless heat," "rogue wave," "tethered eternally"), consistent with a solitary observer's reflective voice, though the register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("Morse-like pulses," "liturgy against isolation") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The tapping practice is described but does not carry distinct idiom or perceptual signature that differentiates this mind from a generic lyric narrator. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks a perceptual signature—what Elias notices is filtered by his role (witness, scientist) but not by contradictory biases or blind spots that reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV distance is stable (close third, single focalizer). However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis perception: "thunderous serenity," "molten amber and deepening indigo," "cosmic thread" feel writerly rather than character-particular. Recycled syntactic stems dominate: "She [verb]," "Elara [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]" across a dozen consecutive beats. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices stars and stones but her way of noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias. Free indirect style is clean, but voice lacks the specificity required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited focalization holds cleanly to Mira with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"mutagenic vapors," "insurgent hideouts," "bioluminescent code"—but occasionally slips into expository register ("a gift from prolonged exposure") that reads like helpful narration rather than Mira's lived idiom. The plants' telepathic chorus is handled as a distinct voice channel ("pressed their leafy thoughts into hers"), which avoids confusion. Psychic distance remains stable, though the workers' arrival at dawn ("awed by the glowing grove") shifts to external observation without a clear POV handoff. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.7)
    Perceptual signature is strong: Elena's hands "callused from years of coaxing," her somatic focus on pulse and mulch. The dialogue with the visitor is goal-driven and imagistic ("They freeze too, in frost, but root through it"), though "somatic markers from some strike of life" edges toward exposition. Psychic distance modulates cleanly—close during the freeze, widening to observe the visitor—and diction remains largely character-bound, slipping only slightly into therapeutic register ("method her therapist had named").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice drifts into elevated, abstract register ("luminescent ache," "Gordian snarl," "phosphorescent waves") that clashes with the urgency of a man in crisis. Perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing isn't character-specific. The rhetorical questions ("Isn't reality just such a deck...?") read as authorial philosophy rather than an artist's working thoughts under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose lacks a distinct texture tied to Elias's particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elowen, but perceptual signature is thin: his observations (eclipse's umbra, wind-carved tents, ink patterns) could belong to any narrator. Diction drifts into elevated academic register ("consciously wild," "shadow-weavers," "temporal affliction," "evolutionary echo") that sits uneasily with a tracker's interiority. Dialogue is minimal; Mira's single line ("Crisis inks the soul…") reads as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech. The void sequence ("time warped instantly, stretching the encampment's tents into infinite echoes") abstracts rather than grounds perception. Rhythmic control is present in the opening but flattens during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, and the voice carries a distinct lyric register ("dizzying quiet," "electric hush of revelation"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing does not feel archivist-specific or character-particular. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("contraband truths coded to awaken select dormant networks") that clashes with embodied urgency. The phrase "bravely conflicted" recurs as a label rather than filtering perception, and "action had chosen for her" externalizes agency in a way that undercuts the established voice. No dialogue appears; all interiority is narrated, reducing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV distance is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("inculcating," "engraved quiet," "psychic weight") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Elara's "senseless perception" is asserted repeatedly but not dramatized through distinct perceptual signature or micro-choices. Jax's single line of dialogue is functional but generic. The prose uses template stems ("she knelt," "she lifted," "she tore") across adjacent beats, flattening rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and Elias's perceptual filter (fisher's instinct, cool-headed pulse). Diction is elevated and lyric-patterned ("feral lullaby," "transliterating emotions"), which fits the tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("voicing silence," "hummed void"). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm is consistent, though the final staccato fragments ("The end? No—only the next cast") feel like conscious stylization rather than voice pressure. Dialogue is absent; no test applies there.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and psychic access stays anchored to Elara. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgent pressure ("solemn playfulness," "mocking her own circling regrets," "spent comets"). Dialogue carries goal pursuit in Thorne's accusation and Elara's rebuttal, but both speak in the same ornate idiom without distinct rhythm or subtext. Filter verbs ("seeing his regrets orbit") appear in emotional peaks without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("Time folded in on itself that night, layers of yesterday bleeding into tomorrow in silent ripples"). However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels imposed rather than character-filtered ("dissonance's orchestra," "firmware-haunt," "cosmic quiet"). Elision of how the amber interfaces with the machine and how the tattoo "tethers" the spirit is purposeful compression but not clearly taught as pattern, leaving key mechanics vague. No dialogue to assess; psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter prioritizes visual pattern and social cues ("playful yet precise," "socially perceptive gaze"). However, diction drifts into elevated, abstracting register during peak beats ("lilac unease," "emergent hush," "fragile unity") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present; Elara's single climactic line ("Look to the mandala—the mist weaves meaning!") reads more like thematic announcement than urgent speech under pressure. Recycled phrase stems ("whimsical," "socially perceptive," "lilac") flatten voice texture across the piece, and psychic distance remains static rather than modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("voice soft as falling snow yet edged with the promise of upheaval") and maintains elevated diction throughout. Kael's single line of dialogue ("I... embraced fire's orphans") reads naturally under stress. However, perceptual signature is generic at peak moments—"her fingers danced," "her gentle radical heart stirred"—relying on label-heavy interiority rather than character-specific noticing. Compression in the retrocognitive sequences is purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV with a consistent synesthetic filter; Elena's perceptual signature (colors/sounds/tastes blending) is distinct and sustained. Reginald's dialogue ("Play it again," "Encore whenever despair calls") carries voice and subtext. However, elevated diction appears throughout peak beats—"encore-seeking stage ghost," "spectral pact," "intertwining echoes"—that reads more literary than lived-in crisis perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the consistent register of poetic abstraction flattens urgency. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable with Elara's interiority anchored throughout. The prose adopts a distinct idiom—scientific skepticism meets affectionate intimacy—but key phrases ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise," "somatic marker") recur as decorative tics rather than voice-motivated rhythm, creating template cadence in peak beats. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Elara's "Help me devise this" and "Feel that?" advance goals without clutter. Psychic distance stays consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, supporting mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV third limited is stable, and the emitter/heat-map vocabulary creates a perceptual signature. However, register drifts into expository abstraction during peak beats: "factually mystical artifact, where quantum-entangled minerals captured ancient emotional echoes" reads like a Wikipedia insert mid-scene. Diction stays consistent in calmer passages but slips into declarative summary at closure ("she embodied the transitional bridge"). Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance widens when it should narrow: the floating climax describes external visuals ("glowing orbs," "thermal specters") instead of Lira's embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elaborate metaphor ("clawed at the sky," "time's fragile pulse," "collective murmurs...fossilized into prophecy"). However, figurative density is high across most beats without tonal modulation under pressure, and the voice remains uniform in register from opening to closure—no shift in psychic distance or cadence to reflect Elias's emotional arc. Perceptual signature is poetic but not character-particular; the diction would fit any contemplative narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose sustains a lyric register ("zephyrs whispered in silver hush") and maintains stable third-limited POV anchored in Elias's scarred perspective. However, diction drifts into elevated, ornamental phrasing ("earth's tilt toward renewal," "ethereally," "vouchsafe the flame") that prioritizes atmosphere over sentence-level propulsion and character-specific perception. Dialogue between Elias and Lena is sparse and functional but carries minimal subtext or goal-driven friction. Filter verbs ("He shook his head," "She fingered her collar") cluster without voice motivation, and the perceptual signature—what Elias notices and how—remains generic spy-thriller focus rather than a burn-victim's sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.7)
    Perceptual signature is present (fog tendrils, gutters ticking, river pulse), but diction drifts into elevated registers ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity," "servient") that clash with a working coachman's plausible lexicon. Repeated template phrases ("ambient awareness," "closely attentive," "percolate") create rhythmic monotony and suggest scaffold artifacts. Psychic distance is stable, but voice lacks the coachman's distinct idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice sustains a lyric-meditative register with purposeful compression ("breath caught," "sharp gentleness") and controlled rhythm that modulates from observation to thrumming intensity. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kai notices fractured timelines, sun patterns, and clay textures in character-specific ways. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts ("phototropically bent," "spectral hum") into register that feels authorial rather than emerging from Kai's potter's idiom, especially under peak pressure. No dialogue to assess; single POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction, however, inflates during high-pressure beats: "quivering hush," "protected vulnerability incarnate," "loss etched in her bitten lips" read as elevated authorial commentary rather than Elara's working-class, fire-escape-gardener lexicon. Dialogue ("Row with me? The harbor listens best at night") carries a mannered poetry that feels scripted rather than natural under stress. The two characters' speech patterns converge into the same lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV third-limited focalization remains stable throughout; Elara's perceptual signature favors ethereal and scholarly diction ("iridescent feathers," "vibrational resonance," "quantum fluctuations"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to charged ritual. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("sovereign archivist," "harmonious balance," "atomic imprints"). The brief dialogue ("Why persist alone?") carries subtext but is sparse. No head-hopping or tense inconsistencies appear, and the prose rhythm accelerates during the sundial sequence, though some lines read as scaffolding ("The hum faded to a contented purr").

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara. However, diction drifts into elevated poetic register inconsistent with an ink-stained letter-writer: "prismatic with quiet ache," "fate's own knot," "liquid light." Dialogue, when present, lacks subtext: Theo's confession "your letters found me first, unsigned wonders that kept me seeking" explains rather than implies. The repeated "inevitably whimsical" functions as authorial label rather than dramatized trait. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices poetically rather than through a letter-writer's particular lens (ink, paper, syntax).

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the voice carries a consistent noir-technical register ("ethereal grit," "raw grind of stars"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Harlan's "They say you're hoarding the truth" and Elara's response land naturally. The narrative occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("badge of battles won in whispers"). Psychic distance control is clean, but the piece recycles sentence stems in the final third ("Cautiously hopeful, she..." appears three times in quick succession), flattening rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited focalization holds without head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable. Voice leans heavily on elevated, archaic diction ("prudently adventurous," "wistful longing," "spatial mutiny," "reverberant calls") that reads more like external narration than Elias's lived perception under stress. Register drift is pervasive: phrases like "claustrophobia clawed at his chest" coexist with abstract declarations ("rebellious stasis," "symphonic triumph") that flatten immediacy. Elias's perceptual signature is generic—he notices arches, shadows, and starlight without character-specific bias or blind spots. No dialogue appears. Peak-stress moments (walls groaning, panic surging) compress into label-driven summary rather than embodied syntax that reflects his mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara. Perceptual signature is present ("Face blind since birth, she painted portraits... from subtle dance of postures"), but diction drifts into elevated literary register ("dormant empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn") that feels imported rather than character-rooted. The vision sequence ("Mira's final dance: not fleeing opposites...") leaps to omniscient certainty without grounding in Elara's perceptual limits. Dialogue is absent; internal voice carries some specificity but inconsistently.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Elara's perceptual signature—map-librarian diction, chart metaphors—is consistent, and the opening establishes narrative distance. However, "nervously confident" recurs as a label across multiple beats without syntactic variation, flattening voice under pressure. Dr. Hale's brief dialogue ("your logs hid it to claim credit!") lands on-page but carries little subtext or goal-driven indirection. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or tense slips mar the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and carries a lyric, reflective register throughout. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty," "ephemeral patterns") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a bridge-side fiddler. Perceptual signature is present ("dynamically observant") but applied as a label more than lived selectivity. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "dusky," "harmonious," "perceptively calm" recur as labels rather than character-specific filters. Dialogue with Raoul ("You're sitting on a fortune" / "See these hoops?") is functional but lacks subtext or distinct idiom. The prose remains distant from Elias's interior; no diction shift under pressure. Filter verbs ("noted," "envisioned") dull immediacy in opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (star charts, dream-veil soaring) but diction drifts into elevated register ("solace deepened," "burden gnawed," "ethereal sweat") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Share it with me," "You witnessed what I could not") without subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance is consistent, yet the prose at peak beats ("tears tracing solace's path") toggles into metaphoric overlay that flattens immediacy. Filter verbs ("he watched," "she stirred") are present but not stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne. However, diction drifts between high-register abstraction ("serene inevitability," "insidious whispers," "hypnotic spirals") and declarative summary ("his guarded nature a fortress," "no longer just the finder of things") that flattens voice into narrator-essay hybrid. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific bias in what Thorne notices or how he interprets. Psychic distance oscillates without purpose: close on blood-drip action, distant on emotional turns ("guard cracked," "soul unguarded"). The prose reads more like mythic narration than lived focalization, weakening immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation thrummed," "sap-blood mingled") carries a fantastical register consistent with the world. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices what the plot requires without bias. Phrase stems recur: "She heeded," "Purposefully curious, she." Internal voice and narrative voice converge without contradiction or stress-driven shift, flattening texture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and consistent tense. Perceptual signature is present ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle") but does not vary under pressure; diction remains elevated and uniform throughout, with no compression or rhythm shift at peak stress. Repeated stems ("her reckless…her idealist…her brother's…") and synonym churn ("fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve," "reckless idealist") flatten texture. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and free indirect style is mostly clean. Diction wobbles between roadie idiom ("wresting meaning from the fabric as if it were a stubborn knot of cable") and elevated metaphor ("Valley longing softened to horizon pull"). The appraisal ritual passages are strong and voice-specific, but the closing sequence lapses into generic inspirational cadence ("The road unspooled, infinite as memory"). Perceptual signature is strongest in the technical notation, weaker in the abstract emotional summary.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third with stable distance. Perceptual signature is present (analogical thinking colors Elias's observations), but diction drifts into elevated register ("Lorentz force shearing bonds," "charged ether") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Purposeful compression ("touching distance," "haunted ambitions") recurs but remains abstract. Psychic distance is consistent. The pilgrims speak briefly; their dialogue ("As clouds part for lightning's bridge...") mirrors Elias's idiom, flattening voice distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "mused") appear frequently but fit the reflective mode without obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited to the librarian's perspective until Elara arrives, then tracks both without head-hopping; section breaks are implicit. Voice is textured with mechanical-organic diction: "joints whirring softly like distant chimes," "steam sighing from vents." Dialogue is sparse and ceremonial, fitting the elevated register. However, emotional peaks ("Her maps unfurled in mind's eye, alive with possibility") slide into abstract summary rather than embodied perception, and "wonder reigniting like wintersun on frost" is a mixed vehicle that strains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with no head-hopping. However, the diction throughout leans into elevated, abstract register ("resonant hush," "latent radiance," "confession's echo") that feels imposed rather than character-particular for a bunker inspector. Perceptual signature is weak; Elias notices crystals and confessions but his way of noticing doesn't reflect his occupation or wound in a distinct idiom. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax remains uniform across emotional beats. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and diction is mostly character-apt ("serpentine whispers," "daringly methodical"). However, elevated register occasionally clashes with immediacy: "palimpsest of fellow seekers," "chroniclers who'd passed through, layering wisdom like river silt." Metaphoric density in high-pressure beats (bathroom discovery) obscures rather than sharpens perception. Purposeful compression is attempted in the final third, but the voice remains explanatory rather than embodied. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance and tense remain stable in third-person limited. Perceptual signature shows some bias (veiled vision, whispered secrets), but diction often drifts into elevated register ("liminal time," "deferred narratives," "arcane") that exceeds the focalizer's lived idiom under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Seek the heart where words unspoken dwell, beyond the mist's delay") reads as thematic echo rather than character-specific speech. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose converges on a decorative lyricism that flattens urgency during the cipher-solving beat.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice remains consistent in register and distance; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, incantatory phrasing disconnected from a researcher's lexicon ("verdant visions," "aching crescendo," "mended weave"). Interior thought is abstract and declarative ("her heart thudded with mulberry ache, purple shadows of doubt") rather than character-particular perception. The ivy's telepathic plea ("Propagate us") carries no distinct idiom from Elara's narration.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric but often drifts into generic high-fantasy register ("liminal realm," "oblivion's edge," "spectral self") that lacks character-specific perceptual signature—Lirien's way of noticing does not distinguish her from a stock narrator. Internal monologue ("Infuse, she whispered") feels performative rather than urgent. Sentence rhythm is uniform (medium-long syntactic arcs) with minimal modulation under peak stress (the piercing and infusion beats proceed at the same measured tempo). No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates—"umbral grotto," "filigreed silver glinting like captured moonlight," "ancestral whispers stirred"—into elevated register that distances the reader from immediate sensation. The lone dialogue ("We whisper to the vines...") arrives only at the end and feels ceremonial rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present (she notices vine textures, tree crowns) but not deeply character-specific; another caretaker might perceive the grove identically. The prose carries a lyric cadence that supports the vineyard-hush tone, though at peak moments (the vision, the scalloping) the voice remains descriptive rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited on Alex, and the perceptual signature—phrases like "sincerely insincere" and "protected vulnerability"—recurs to establish voice. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("curated empathy," "oracle bones") that exceeds Alex's established lexicon, especially under peak stress. Dialogue is sparse; Elias's lines ("Certainties are hooks in the soul") read like scripted aphorisms rather than goal-driven speech with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("sycamore hush," "reversed waterfalls over boyish shoulders") but lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selective attention under stress. The self-interrupting meta-commentary ("Wait, too many words already? No, adjust") breaks the narrative frame and exposes scaffold. No dialogue appears to evaluate. Diction remains elevated throughout without modulation tied to pressure shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Thren; diction ("historically reverent," "weathered resolve," "pulse left wandering") is elevated and consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("motionless navigation," "aerial scripture") that depersonalizes his perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, the prose treats Thren's interior as a static tableau rather than a mind under pressure—no modulation in syntax or rhythm across decades of waiting, and the final revelation is told ("granting the knowledge he craved") rather than filtered through lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("vast Artificers wove symphonies," "brilliance dimmed," "automated elegies"), creating a lyric texture. However, diction frequently drifts into abstraction and thesaurus-driven phrasing ("accommodates impossibilities," "lingering luminance") that can feel external to Thorne's lived perspective. Filter verbs ("he had read," "he knew") are present but not intrusive. Perceptual signature is generic—descriptive details read as narrator-provided rather than filtered through Thorne's particular priorities or biases. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The voice is coherent but lacks the specificity and compression under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias, and the prose sustains a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, diction frequently drifts into stock metaphor ("heart quickened," "breath caught," "whisper threading the hush") and filter verbs ("realized," "felt") that dull immediacy. The spectral librarian's dialogue ("You seek the color of sound") reads stilted and expository. Perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices what the plot requires rather than what a lamplighter might uniquely perceive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices what the plot requires (coins, bursts, visions) without character-specific bias or idiosyncratic filter. Diction drifts into elevated register ("cast lots decision maker," "wavelength align") that reads more like prompt echo than lived interior voice. No dialogue is present to test subtext or voice distinction. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under pressure. The prose often tells internal state ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt clawed at her") rather than showing embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Voice carries a lush, slightly archaic register ("ether," "void pits," "luminous scatter") consistent with the reaper figure and gothic tone. Perceptual filtering is mostly consistent, though phrases like "distant intimacy" and "heartbroken no more" occasionally drift into external summary rather than interior texture. The prose maintains narrative distance without head-hopping; diction stays within the established register, and psychic distance modulates purposefully at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in limited third, but diction oscillates between high-register lyricism ("ethereal blue," "essence of drowned sailors' oaths") and explanatory exposition ("a secret his grandmother claimed mirrored cosmic equilibrium") that pulls out of Elowen's immediate perception. Recycled stems—"lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion"—appear in nearly every paragraph, flattening rhythmic variety. Interiority leans on filter verbs ("he believed," "he recalled") and summary self-awareness ("why him, the half-mage, when titans had failed?") that distances the reader from embodied thought. The prose voice reads more as narrator commentary than character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mirrored hush," "midnight's embrace," "fracturing souls") that reads ornamental rather than voice-specific. Dialogue between Elias and Mira is sparse and functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom—both speak in the same register of careful, thesis-adjacent lines. The repeated phrases ("mirrored hush," "precisely humane," "sapphire hue") function as motif anchors but become template cadence when over-deployed.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, and diction maintains an elevated, archaic-fantasy register throughout ("ancient freshness," "arcane labors," "sated stars"). However, distance control is slack: phrases like "secretly sentimental" and "proof that intuition stirred beneath her alchemist's veneer" read as narrator intrusion rather than Elara's self-perception. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated. Psychic distance remains consistently mid-range, but the prose never modulates under pressure—the same ornate, declarative cadence persists from ritual preparation through purported climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (pattern-seeking, technical precision). Dialogue with Lena is goal-driven and advances plot. However, the prose suffers from heavy recurrence of key phrases: "soundless echo" appears six times, "the watcher's burden" four times, "muscle memory" five times, creating a template cadence that mechanically cycles motifs rather than modulating naturally. Voice distinction between narration and Lena's brief responses is minimal but acceptable given brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction often inflates to elevated register ("pristine echo arguing," "sigils that bound opposites") that clashes with present-tense crisis urgency. Dialogue from Elara and the clone is serviceable but generic; no perceptual signature distinguishes Kai's noticing—he observes temporal rewrites and his own emotional void in equally detached syntax. Purposeful compression is not taught; the prose remains expository throughout, summarizing rather than inhabiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV focused on Elias, with a heightened, lyric register ("forsaken vein," "phosphor glow," "reedy falsetto"). However, diction remains uniform across emotional beats—no compression or simplification under peak pressure—and the elevated vocabulary ("maceration," "polyphony," "balm") feels imposed rather than character-particular for a ghostly conductor. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The half-sung lullaby fragments are integrated into action, adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: elevated diction ("foggy lucidity," "stacked infinities," "fractal patterns") fits the dreamlike frame. Psychic distance is stable throughout. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract formulations ("method of interiorizing them," "core concept that haunted my exile") that assert rather than dramatize. Register remains constant under pressure without the compression or sensory narrowing one might expect during the climax. No dialogue present; internal monologue maintains coherence but lacks a perceptual signature beyond the elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV is stable and the elevated diction ("ember nexus," "vivify," "successive approximation") creates a consistent alchemical register. However, the prose leans heavily on stock philosophical phrases ("stoically sensitive veil," "perpetual defeat scrawled by indifferent fates") that feel more like writing-prompt echoes than character-particular perception. Elias's internal voice doesn't modulate under pressure—he remains equally articulate and measured across all emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated-practical register ("fantasy practicality," "practical magic") that matches the concept. Diction is controlled and distinct ("void-veined," "serenely electric," "velvet" for hushed static). The piece teaches its compression pattern early (clipped declaratives, fragment closures) and maintains it. However, some lines slide into expository summary ("Assumptions cluttered reception, like preconceived frequencies blocking truth") that tells rather than shows her perceptual signature. The "Wait, recount final" meta-comment at the end is a visible generation artifact but does not obscure the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register incongruent with a deckhand's voice ("motives crystallized," "filigree," "binding filigree"), and interiority leans on stock maritime metaphors ("his optimism a buoy"). Dialogue in the parallel-Elias exchange is functional but brief; internal voice does not differentiate under pressure. Elias's perceptual signature—nautical charts, tidal flows—appears once to justify pattern-reading but is not sustained as a filtering lens. No head-hopping or major stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Elias's architect sensibility. Diction is elevated and consistent ("unsettling calm," "rational enchantments," "texture of connection") but edges into abstract elevation that distances reader from embodied experience. No dialogue appears. Voice specificity is present in recurring phrases ("fever dream architect," "realistically imaginary") but these become ornamental tags rather than perceptual signature. Under peak pressure—the eruption—syntax compresses purposefully, yet the narration remains externalized rather than inhabiting his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narration holds third-person limited on Kai without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. However, diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with a salvage diver's lexicon: "benthic gloom," "dihedral angles," "exponentially," "somber hymn," "veils no compass can chart." Dialogue ("the aliens' horizons beckon, but without starlight navigation, we're anchored in ignorance") reads scripted rather than spoken under pressure. Elara and Kai share uniform syntax and tone; no perceptual signature distinguishes the focalizer's noticing habits from the instructor's.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("Elara's breath caught in the reeling hush") but voice suffers from repeated template cadence: "Elara [verb], [object]" stems dominate, and the prose leans toward elevated register ("ethereal links," "borrowed words") without clear character-specific idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Clara's "For the first time in years, I feel her heartbeat" reads slightly expository. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrative certainty ("she'd traced such links before") asserts expertise without dramatized proof.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction modulates between physical immediacy ("Sweat beaded despite the chill; each breath fought the panic") and tech-register abstractions ("biofield," "quantum slips," "phase-shifted data imprints") that feel layered in rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is selective—she notices cable junctions, gold flecks, tidal timing—but interior texture flattens under stress into explanatory catalog rather than degraded thought. Psychic distance is controlled, though the exposition of Project Abysslink and cable mechanics intrudes mid-crisis without embodied anchor. Minor: "claustrophobia raged in the ethereal squeeze, yet purpose held her" tells state rather than showing contradictory impulses in action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register incongruent with immediate action under pressure ("ephemeral patterns," "midnight solace tones," "luminous avatar"). The ghost's dialogue ("I am the echo... scattered," "To speak truth from our failures, defragment me") reads slightly formal but serves the digital-specter conceit. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully during the defragmentation sequence, though some stems repeat ("The ghost…," "Elara…"). Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific—descriptions could belong to any reflective observer.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Thorne's copper-veined perspective. Diction is elevated and consistent ("quietly articulate," "labyrinthine choirs," "zhar'keth," "syl'vren"), creating a distinct narrative texture. However, perceptual signature is more atmospheric than character-specific—Thorne's way of noticing reads generic-lyric rather than uniquely his own. The sparse dialogue ("The birds script the air; they can script the echoes too") is aptly measured but insufficient to test voice under conversational pressure. Psychic distance holds steady, though the final paragraphs shift slightly toward omniscient summary ("future wanderers would enter").

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.1)
    POV remains stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("sylvan whimsy," "primordial skies," "eternal, whimsical flight") that exceeds Elara's on-page lexicon. The brother's single line of dialogue—"See? The ultimate joke—gravity's got a sense of humor"—sounds writerly rather than spoken. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("felt it," "felt the action"), dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices like a neutral camera.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction oscillates between elevated ("liminal space pulsed alive," "coaxing melody from wood and horsehair") and sensory concrete ("ba-dum" rhythm, "fingers digging into soil"), creating register drift under pressure. The repeated phrase "resonantly soft" and "gap between knowing and understanding" function as template anchors rather than voice-particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance widens at key beats (statues "converged" is told summary when dramatization would sharpen urgency). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present (respectful nods, tactical sorting) but diction drifts into elevated register ("brittle hush," "unmet eyes," "thunderstorm in a bottle") that clashes with a working mailman's lexicon under operational stress. Dialogue with the guard is functional but generic. The prose texture is more lyric-atmospheric than character-particular, and the final paragraphs shift into authorial summary ("His motivation burned clear") that tells rather than trusts dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is selective (wind bells, dew-kissed petals, carousel relics) and tied to Elias's craft. Diction is elevated and poetic ("whispering gleam," "misting hush," "ethos") but stays mostly consistent. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("interpreting silence as possibility," "ethos embodied") that feels authorial rather than character-specific for a carpenter. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm modulates with intensity (shorter clauses during discovery, longer during restoration) but repetitive poetic constructions ("quietly persistent," "whispering gleam") create mild template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (geometry-obsessed librarian interpreting the world through curvature and tessellations) is distinct. However, the prose drifts into expository summary at peak beats ("The core concept gripped her"; "Eliza's motivation sharpened") rather than dramatizing perception under pressure. Diction occasionally reaches for elevated register ("non-Euclidean fury," "mathematical poetry made manifest") that reads more like authorial gloss than the librarian's lived idiom. Purposeful compression in the final third creates cadence shift, but multiple filter verbs ("saw flashes," "noted the implications") and recycled stems ("Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely"; "sanely, Eliza noted") flatten immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elevated, lyric diction ("improbable beginnings," "luminous absence," "cipher of longing") is consistent and pattern-taught, establishing an incantatory voice. However, register remains uniformly high across emotional peaks and practical actions (adjusting camera, developing plates), reducing pressure modulation. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Elara's noticing reads as atmospheric catalog rather than biased selection. No dialogue. Purposeful compression qualifies under experimental tolerance, but the static register and lack of diction shift under stress prevent higher scoring. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice relies on elevated, abstract diction throughout—"the hush of cosmic possibility," "disorienting his own steadfast world"—that reads as ornament rather than character-particular perception. Dialogue carries little subtext; the woman's "This holds my truth" and the locksmith's "freedom demands disorientation first" sound like thesis statements. The final fragments abandon narrative stance for a list of conceptual claims without a stable focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elias's perceptual signature: scholarly, detail-oriented, filtered through folklore knowledge. Diction is largely consistent and voice-motivated ("chronically curious," "meticulously kept journals"). One brief register drift: "holographic tapestry" feels slightly modern against the otherwise naturalistic idiom. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the memory recovery. No dialogue; narrative stance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct narrative texture (arch, formal diction fits the archivist role). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven when present. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated phrasing that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("combative tenderness," "quiet mentorship" recur as narrative labels). The backwards-walking tic is narrated rather than felt from inside Elara's urgency. Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV anchored in Lirien is stable, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("verdant parapet," "insatiably creative," "radiant hush"), but diction often drifts into stock lyricism rather than character-particular perception—Lirien's "wise gaze" and "orchard wisdom" are told, not shown through his noticing. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Lirien's lines ("You seek what blooms only in hidden groves") read as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance stays mid-range throughout, with no modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than specific to a decades-long pruner.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    Perceptual signature is weak: Lirien's narration defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush," "accumulating silence") that clashes with the tactile work of a restorer. The shade's voice ("I share a secret across this night," "It binds my own echo") reads as stilted and ornamental rather than goal-driven. POV distance is stable, but psychic proximity never tightens under pressure—peak beats ("Unrest crested—prisms trembled") remain externalized. Dialogue carries no subtext or evasion; the shade delivers exposition without pursuit or resistance. Template cadence appears in beats 17–22 ("The second spirit burst forth," "The shade shared more," "Lirien's needle flew").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature ("methodically curious," vault details filtered through a framer's eye) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register at emotional peaks ("tears blurring his vision—not rain, but release"; "sacred voids"; "shielded openness cracked slightly") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Elias's internal voice relies on recycled stems ("methodically," "perceptively," "empathetically") and therapy-speak ("shielded openness," "profound empathy") that flatten his texture under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("This isn't erosion, it's an invitation") advances theme but reads more like thesis than spoken thought.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.4)
    Register mismatch pervades: Elara's interior voice oscillates between embodied dive narration and academic abstraction ("F = ma yielding to Schrödinger's wave"). Dialogue with Elias reads as thematic soliloquy rather than interaction. POV remains single and stable, but psychic distance is inconsistent—alternating between sensory immediacy and detached philosophizing. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") are overused without voice motivation. The prose at peak moments (discovery of the note, final release) does not heighten rhythmically.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elowen with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (she hears whispers others miss, traces letters in petal curves) but relies on repetitive phrase structures: "driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder," "seldom-heard" recur as labels rather than enacted perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("articulate the heart's hidden yearnings," "ecode the ghost's essence") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The ghost's rasping speech ("You hear me") and Elowen's sung line show modest voice distinction, but overall the prose reads as a single ornate narrative voice rather than Elowen's lived idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature ("warm inquisitiveness," focus on joy/anguish) is consistent. However, diction drifts into overwritten registers ("affectionate detachment," "phantom love," "captain's blood in her veins") that exceed Lira's scullery-to-servant lexicon. Filter verbs and summary predominate over immediate perception. No dialogue appears. The mid-story self-correction artifact ("Wait, too many—trimming in mind…") and word-count commentary break narrative immersion and signal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV (close third) is stable and filter verbs ("he swore," "he knew") feel voice-motivated given the reflective register. Diction is controlled with elevated metaphoric density ("velvet detonation," "spectral confetti") that matches Elias's scientific-poetic lens. However, perceptual signature weakens under stress—peak beats ("quietly explosive surge") adopt generic intensifiers rather than character-specific perception. The sustained lyricism compresses emotional immediacy in favor of aesthetic texture, and the ending's declaration ("he knew his motivation fulfilled") reads as narrator summary rather than dramatized realization through Elias's specific noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara's face-blind perception ("faces interchangeable smears," "blurred faces"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate crisis register—"fractally precise," "prosopagnosia," "bilateral symmetry"—reading more expository than character-urgent in peak moments. The perceptual signature is consistent: she sees "patterns where others saw faces." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the crafting sequence, tightening as tools click into place. One friction: the middle reflective block ("The guild had faltered here, their scholarly minds too rigid for fractal chaos; faces, with their bilateral symmetry, had blinded them") shifts into essayistic analysis that flattens voice texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with clear psychic distance, but the narrative voice drifts into guidebook register ("a relic from the golden age of aerial exploration," "undulating waves of black wings") that feels external to her apprentice interiority. Her self-narration ("Why, hello there, old friend," "Ha! You're a beauty") is performed sociability rather than character-specific idiom under pressure. Dialogue to herself reads as authorial exposition of her trait rather than natural thought. Perceptual signature is generic adventure-narrator; vocabulary (murmuration, cipher, nexus, harvestable) oscillates between YA and elevated diction without anchoring in her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during gear assembly, pulling back for the epilogue). However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register inconsistent with on-page interiority: "vertigo-inducing infinity," "hypnotic pulse," "prismatic ghosts of memory" feel more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (the locksmith notices gears and grooves) but underdeveloped; no micro-choices in phrasing reveal his occupational idiom under stress, and the prose texture remains uniform across calm and climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is third-omniscient with no consistent focalizer; the narrative drifts among the four without section breaks or distinct internal texture. The prose oscillates between lush descriptors ("nebula of respite shimmered like a promise of balm") and flat summary ("After strangers became family"). Dialogue is functional but generic—Kael's grumble and Mira's reply carry no idiom or subtext that distinguishes them. Free indirect style is attempted ("Why trust a ghost?") but the internal voice is indistinct from narration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the diction ("bruised awe," "velvet void," "flawed ember") sustains a distinct, elevated register. Focalization is clean—no head-hopping—though the narration occasionally drifts into Wikipedia-voice abstraction ("the core concept of his isolation") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("bruised awe filled him"). Elias's perceptual signature (epoch weight, nested-pattern obsession) is present but not strongly idiosyncratic; the voice reads as competent literary omniscient rather than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent and distinct, with purposeful diction ("offhandedly exact," "graceless spirals") that reflects the narrator's close third-person filter on Elias's perspective. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose has a textured rhythm ("His heart thudded gracelessly, like the birds' gears"). Dialogue is minimal but functional. However, some phrasing feels slightly elevated for a weary caretaker under pressure ("prismatic beauty," "ballet of bangs and glimmers"), creating minor register drift. The final line's self-awareness ("cursing all the while") is character-consistent but edges toward summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric-register voice ("bruised purples," "symphonically minded," "frothy divergence"). Perceptual signature (chemist noticing foam lattices, hydrogen bonding) is present but elevated diction ("iridescent films," "transient unity") sometimes drifts above immediate embodied perception under stress. No dialogue. The coda shifts to summary distant omniscience ("Tests confirmed… deployed… restored clarity"), breaking the intimate present-tense filter established in the ravine sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout with distinct texture ("silver liquid pooled in his palm, cool as forgotten dreams"). POV remains stable third-limited to Elias. However, the diction at peak beats ("quantifying absence revealed the pattern: voids shaped him more than events") slips into abstract philosophizing that distances rather than embodies. Perceptual signature is present but relies on metaphor over sensory particularity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elaris throughout, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated register ("metallic tang," "veined with eternal frost," "neural paths") that fits a chef attuned to sensory and alchemical nuance. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight interiority during peak remorse absorption ("gasped, visions overlaying"), wider during the pavilion's discovery. However, several lines drift into over-articulated narration that exceeds Elaris's plausible real-time awareness: "analyzing tidal pool formations—ripples etched in wet sand, patterns like veins of forgotten seas" reads more like authorial description than a character's urgent thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("understood now," "visions overlaying") occasionally dull immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited anchors to Elara, but the prose drifts into elevated register ("vertiginous summits," "comet tails," "ethereal hush") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Dialogue appears in the climactic talk ("Escuchen, listen, послухайте") but is scaffolded by exposition ("her harmonious choral timbre rising polyphonically") that tells effect rather than trusting the reader to hear it. The phrase "vigorous tender" recurs as a template descriptor (four times), creating a rhythmic tic that flattens voice under pressure. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing (brass, stars, weights) remains generic librarian-astronomer rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("synaptic plasticity," "helical excavation," "entangled archives") that exceeds plausible on-page thought for a character under stress. Perceptual signature is present (helix motifs, fractured light) but syntactic stems repeat mechanically ("Elara's attribute," "The core concept," "Profound transformation"). No dialogue. Psychic distance shifts are unintentional, oscillating between close interiority and distant narration without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is ornate and consistent but leans heavily on elevated diction ("clandestinely luminous," "serpentine curves undulating") that clashes with the urgency of a timed quest. Perceptual signature is abstract and generic ("prism-minded nature reveled in it, parsing the effects into navigable spectra") rather than character-specific. Filter verbs and stock metaphors accumulate without voice-motivated purpose. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in "each hairline fracture a note" and "empathy flowing from wood to his veins." Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("symphonically minded," "keening edge," "profound hush"), and no head-hopping occurs. However, the prose leans on repeated formulaic phrases—"empathy in motion," "symphonically minded" appears five times—and filter constructions ("he felt," "he traced") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated justification. The rhythmic control is present but the recurring lexical loops and label-speak prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("jagged horizon," "eclipsed covenant," "Morse of magnetic whispers") with purposeful compression in places. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing that exceeds a chess tutor's plausible interiority under pressure: "profound grace of struggle," "loveliness unforeseen," "twilight tension, before the next phase claimed its due." Perceptual signature (chess precision, measured steps) is present but does not modulate under peak stress—syntax remains ornate and steady when urgency might compress. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice oscillates between elevated register ("gravid silence before catharsis, pregnant with communal joy") and grounded detail without stable POV distance. Theatrical self-address to the diary reads as performed rather than organic to Elias's perceptual signature. Filter verbs and abstract phrasing ("intuitively descriptive waves painting the air with invisible colors") dull immediacy in peak beats. Free indirect style is attempted but the lexicon ("catalog the varieties of silence," "pacifism flowered") exceeds plausible interior diction for a character in the moment of tuning a device.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV third-person with consistent focalization through Elara. Diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("wildflower hush of dawn," "titan petal pulsing under moonlight") and abstract labels ("ambition gnawed," "wisdom flowed"). Register drift is mild but persistent; the voice reads as curated rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears; interiority remains coherent but generic at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Perceptual signature is present: "gaunt cheeks tightened," "hyper-vital moss," sensory focus on hum and silence. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("whirling silence profound as a tomb," "liquid starlight") that feels authorial rather than pilot-practical, especially under stress. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs as anchoring idiom but begins to read decorative by the third use. No dialogue on the page; filter verbs ("felt," "glimpsed," "gasped") are frequent but remain legible within the focalizer's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; Elias's perceptual bias (wind patterns, investigative focus) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("singular convergence," "cultivate foresight") that sits awkwardly against the investigative frame. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are sparse. The prose has some rhythmic variety, though sentence openings show moderate repetition ("Elias + verb" pattern across multiple paragraphs). No dialogue present. Voice is competent but not distinctive; the investigator's internal texture lacks the idiosyncratic stamp that would elevate this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is consistent and ornate, with stable third-person limited POV and a heightened register ("synesthetically blessed," "oscillating repose"). However, the diction repeatedly drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("unfetter," "oscillating," "sculpted hush") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than a distinct filter shaped by Elyra's lived experience. No dialogue is present to judge. The prose occasionally telegraphs the concept rather than trusting image: "to unfetter wonder itself, bound within the ice's embrace."

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elaron with consistent narrative distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gleaned wisdom," "harboring relics without allies") that feels slightly external to a grief-driven relic keeper, though not enough to break voice. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"weight of memory," "pulse of anticipation"—without character-specific filtering. No dialogue appears. Syntax and rhythm support the contemplative tone but do not vary purposefully under pressure; the spectral confrontation maintains the same measured cadence as the earlier trudge, flattening emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Elias's perceptual filter is consistent throughout. However, the prose distance oscillates between close embodiment ("his thoughts churned clear yet chaotic") and detached summary ("he understood: transposed empathy was the ultimate equation"), flattening peak moments. Mira's brief dialogue and the shared chorus ("The halo fractures to unify") converge in register without distinct idiom, though the effect may be intentional during the transpose. The narrative voice leans on elevated diction ("lucid turbulence," "arcuate path") that occasionally drifts from Elias's operator role without clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is present (aurora as "captured sky fragment," routine as drudgery). The brief dialogue between Kael and Lira feels natural and goal-driven ("Relic for your forge?" / shrug / wing reveal). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("vibrate sympathetically," "germinate," "across the fade") that feels more authorial than courier-particular. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but "routine suspicion in her gaze" and "envisioned forges lit by captured auroras" narrate Lira's interiority with unwarranted certainty for Kael's POV, a minor emotional ventriloquism slip.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during frost communion, wider during framing). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the scientist's internal voice ("prayers," "serpents," "vault") without clear ironic frame. The line "To commune is to listen where words fail" and similar aphorisms feel like thematic placards rather than character-specific thought under pressure. Dialogue to the mist ("I see you") and window ("Feel me" response) works as communion beats, and perceptual signature (tracing unseen threads, measuring shadows) is consistent. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice leans heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("wistful," "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") that distances the reader from Elara's lived experience. Perceptual signature is generic—"fingers tracing patterns born of longing"—rather than idiosyncratic. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance never modulates; the prose maintains a uniform lyric register through discovery, weaving, and death, flattening emotional progression. Register drift into poetic abstraction ("the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" repeated thrice) reads as template cadence rather than voice-motivated compression.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third-person maintains stable distance and POV modesty throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature leans toward elevated diction ("azure defiance," "comet-veils," "spider-lore") that charges atmosphere but occasionally drifts from a soot-streaked blacksmith's likely lexicon under stress. Dialogue is minimal (one magician exchange) and functional. The prose carries a lyric texture—purposeful compression, patterned azure imagery—but the final third slips into summary voice ("whispers spread," "orchards thrived") that flattens immediacy when the ending beat demands concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single-POV baseline holds with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet hush," "acrid smoke," "verdant fire"), but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Elara's sensory mapping reads generically poetic rather than reflecting her particular hierarchy of attention. Filter verbs ("felt," "glimpsed," "understood") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. The mentor's echo speaks in thesis-voice ("Your birth wove two worlds") rather than idiomatic dialogue. Free indirect style is clean, yet the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure; key beats adopt the same lyric cadence without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV on Elias is maintained without head-hopping, and his perceptual signature (warmly observant, tracing silhouettes, brushing formations) is consistent. Harlan's dialogue ("Pocket that," "Not mine first") carries regional brevity and subtext. However, the narration suffers from register drift: "luminescent ache," "abyssal black," "spectral moans" elevate diction beyond a supply skipper's idiom at peak moments, and the final paragraph's visible text artifacts ("Wait, recount precisely later," "No, must hit 600-800," "[Over]") are non-diegetic scaffolding that breaks voice and distance. The artifacts trigger the Q6 contamination penalty (−0.2) for voice integrity loss, compounding the diction issues.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is elevated and consistent, employing lyric compression ("star-fretted dome," "inky tendrils leaching from the sea") that fits the otherworldly Herald role. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock gothic ("veil's frayed edge," "abyssal rifts") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("shadowed elation," "manic glee") that labels rather than embodies. Filter verbs ("felt the shift," "seemed to dim") cluster in the climax without clear necessity. Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices light-loops and reflective visions—but does not modulate distinctly under peak pressure; the syntax remains uniformly elevated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature filters through Elowen's dye-master lens ("precise world of vats and pigments," "discerning subtle hue shifts"). Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful compression ("question quietly explosive," "voracity," "indelibly"). However, register occasionally spikes into prompt-echo phrasing ("iridescent caution," "valley-mist wonder," "quietly explosive") that reads as imposed rather than emerging from Elowen's interior voice. Syntax is rhythmic but leans toward uniform lyricism; under peak stress (the wing's revelation) the voice does not compress or shift, missing an opportunity for modulation that reflects pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction ("sentinel oaks," "quantified sorrow," "ephemeral wisps")—that matches the tone and world. However, under peak pressure (the final corridor walk, the pin-drop epiphany), the voice does not compress or modulate; it maintains the same ornate distance, reducing urgency. Perceptual signature is present (moonlight as balm, dreams as motes) but does not shift with Elias's internal state. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent and no head-hopping occurs. Diction is elevated and lyric ("threads golden filaments," "molten dawnlight"), fitting the fantastical register, though it risks purple density in peak beats. Perceptual signature is present but generic (fragments swirling, memories aligning). No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not triggered. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and filter verbs are minimal. The voice is distinct and controlled, earning mid-6s; reaching higher would require sharper interior contradiction or elision that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.5)
    The register is elevated and uniform, with phrases like "enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradoxes," and "stardust" that sit outside Elara's librarian POV. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable. Psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrator asserts the young man's "paradox of his terror" and later his "crumpled fears smoothing" without access. Diction remains abstract ("ethereal light," "infinite library") during peak beats rather than grounding in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; distance is controlled and perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer") colors his observations. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that clashes with embodied action: "heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution," "sacralized by memory," "creeping normality had lulled him too." These academic-leaning constructions accumulate across peak beats, dulling immediacy. Dialogue between Elias and Mira is functional but lacks distinct idiom; their speech could be swapped with minor edits. No head-hopping, but voice specificity under pressure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Elias. Voice carries elevated, lyric diction ("quartz hush," "ethereal wisps") that reads purposeful and consistent. However, register uniformity flattens across pressure peaks—intensity does not modulate syntax or rhythm. Repetitive stems appear: "gently meticulous" recurs three times, "luminous vows" six times, creating template cadence. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic archival ("orderly," "meticulous") without character-specific bias in what Elias notices or ignores. Under peak stress, diction remains ornate rather than compressing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and focalization remains anchored to Lila throughout. However, certain phrases—"curiously steadfast," "comforting unease"—recur as narratorial labels rather than emerging from Lila's perceptual signature, creating slight distance drift. Dialogue (Thorne's leer, the runner's accusation) is sparse but functional, carrying goal pursuit and subtext. Diction largely fits the setting, though occasional elevated turns ("truce of hush demanded all scatter") feel more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative voice has rhythmic texture, but the repeated descriptors and stock pirate-market idiom prevent a fully distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and distance is controlled, with no head-hopping. Diction is purposefully elevated and ornate—"terrestrially cosmic," "pheromone ballots," "synesthetic quirk"—fitting a voice that prizes the poetic. However, register drifts into abstraction under pressure: "nostalgic veil," "convergences aligned," "terrestrially cosmic symphony" replace concrete perception. The dialogue from the mist-man is expository thesis rather than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is present (taste-synesthesia) but deployed mechanically rather than through selective, biased noticing that changes under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to Elias's interiority. Diction choices like "charcoal-fingered," "mnemonically gifted," and "auroral sorrow" establish a distinct texture. However, phrases such as "inescapable calling" and "bottled storm" feel imported rather than Elias's own lexicon. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("gilded-leaf calligrapher," "toxic pall," "quill's nib") sustains a lyric register consistent with Elara's artisan perspective. Purposeful compression in vault discovery and mentor-voice replay fits accumulative pacing. Dialogue (vendor's child, fellow worker) carries subtext and advances plot without filter-verb stacks. Minor register drift: "Candor in small moments, she mused" reads slightly expository mid-crisis, though brief.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited holds stable without head-hopping, and diction ("muted vigor," "whispering bluff") maintains a lyric register. However, perceptual signature is generic; Elara's interiority consists of declarations ("her resolve surged") rather than specific, character-bound noticing. Elevated diction ("encroaching gray," "stellar nurseries") does not reflect a bell tuner's particular lexicon. The prose reads as a single, unvarying voice across all beats, with no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV android focalization is stable, with diction mixing technical precision ("servos," "nanite swarms") and nostalgic abstraction ("childhood laughter whole again"). The perceptual signature—circuits humming, static roaring—is consistent, though some metaphors blur under pressure ("static clawed deeper" lacks embodied specificity). Filter verbs ("Zeta's vision stuttered") and expository interiority ("To survive, it needed escape") occasionally dull immediacy. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts, but the voice converges toward generic lyricism in the final third ("eternal vigil," "blooming defiant") rather than maintaining the android's distinct lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV focalization holds; no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: "sandstorm calm" and "discerning" appear as labels, not lived syntax. Dialogue from four neighbors reads interchangeably formal ("The locket's chain leads through following the fountain's trickle to the oak's roots"). Template cadence pervades high-pressure beats: "She heard… She rose… She smiled… She lingered… She slipped…" across the final third. The closing "Her work done" narrates rather than trusts the image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara's noticing does not reflect character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mysterious familiarity," "lyrical triumph") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The brief dialogue at the end is functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven indirection. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("her motivation burned deep") dull immediacy. Prose rhythm is competent but not voice-distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the opening whale image establishes voice. However, the prose drifts into elevated, poeticized register ("colossal body slumped... like a forgotten monument," "gleaming silence," "hushed sanctum") that reads ornamental rather than character-filtered—Elias is a lantern lighter, not a memoirist. Perceptual signature is generic; syntactic patterns repeat ("pockets of gravity... mysterious anomalies," "driven by... abandoned... descended") without modulation under stress. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "velvet glide") that reads ornamental rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is generic; no micro-filter reveals how this summoner notices differently under stress. Sentence stems recur ("The…," "Elias…," "He…") without purposeful variation. No dialogue is present. The voice lacks a distinct texture that would survive a name swap.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent narrative distance. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("dust motes in sunlight," "living breath of edifices"), and the free indirect style is clean. Dialogue when present ("Tell me the truth, Professor") serves goal pursuit and carries subtext. However, perceptual signature is thin—Elara's noticing does not vary with stress, and interior phrasing occasionally slips into abstraction ("motivation crystallized"). The prose rhythm modulates appropriately from summary (tea sessions) to scene (rooftop), but lacks the sentence-level variance that would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent narrative distance. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "velvet expanse thickened") that fits the tonal aim. Perceptual signature is present but generic across beats; diction does not degrade under peak stress. Filter-verb stacks ("traced," "placing," "chanted," "weaving") cluster in the ritual sequence without immediate embodiment, reducing propulsion. The final lines compress into summary mode, flattening the narrator's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, establishing a heightened, lyric register ("pearl twilight," "spectral grasp," "invisible tether"). However, the voice leans toward ornamental phrasing that obscures urgency: "stalactites dripped their slow litany," "aurora ribbons wove through the marble dome." Psychic distance remains far throughout; we are told Elias's feelings ("trembled not from cold but catharsis") rather than inhabiting his sensory present under pressure. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is attempted but the result feels distancing rather than intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose sustains a lyric register with consistent elevated diction ("reed-blown melancholy," "serpentine nexus"), but voice does not modulate under pressure—peak confrontation sounds identical to opening atmosphere. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the oracle's "Webs tighten" and the guardian's question feel like placeholder lines. No perceptual signature emerges; Elyra's "richly perceptive" lens is asserted but her noticing remains generic. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was learned," "were plotted") dilute immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent elevated register with mythic cadence ("borrowed starlight," "captured constellations," "veins of quartz in the glacier's glow"). POV distance is stable third-limited, focusing on Elara's perception and ritual actions. Psychic distance tightens during the cameo visions, appropriately. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract explanatory mode ("guilt woven into the dream's fabric," "truth coalesced") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is coherent but somewhat uniform across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Kai's focus on nets, patterns, webs) but diction drifts into elevated register ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "gossamer webs") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-specific. Interiority relies on filter verbs ("sought to appreciate," "contemplated") and abstract philosophy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mending sequence. No dialogue to assess. Rhythm is controlled but occasionally formulaic (repeated "Kai [verb]" openings).

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elias's perceptual filter ("sharply observant eyes," "intuited the full peril"). Diction is controlled, though "keen gaze" and "sharp observance" repeat within tight proximity, flattening texture. No dialogue appears; the piece is all narration and reflection. Free indirect style is clean, but the final third drifts toward summary rather than scene ("He pressed on, mask fogging once more") when dramatization would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently lifts into elevated register ("lyrically prophetic," "variant allegiance," "gritty whimsy") that reads more as authorial decoration than Elias's perceptual signature under pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "Elias [verb]" opens multiple beats, and "gritty" / "whimsical" / "variant" recur as decorative modifiers rather than voice-motivated texture. The final paragraph's syntactic uniformity ("He had shaped it all—gritty, whimsical, inexorable") signals template cadence rather than escalating rhythm. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with a lyric, elevated register ("lonesome splendor," "positively wistful," "splendorous sorrow") that remains consistent but borders on over-ornamentation in peak beats. The prose uses purposeful compression ("At dawn's earliest whistle") and the perceptual signature is poetic, yet diction often drifts into generic lyricism ("ethereal vapors twist like auroras") that could apply to any mystical protagonist. Dialogue is minimal; the grandmother's line carries subtext, but Elias's call ("Penny poets' wonders!") and his explanation feel functional rather than voice-specific. Filter verbs ("he imagined," "stirred something deep") cluster without adding immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between elevated register ("vibrational hymn," "orgasmic clarity") and mechanical exposition ("ancient console," "crystalline resonator") without a consistent perceptual signature. Elias's way of noticing is not character-particular; sensory detail reads as authorial catalog rather than filtered through his profession or emotional state. The phrase "logically emotional" is meta-commentary rather than enacted voice. Peak-stress moments default to stock embodiment ("heart thundered," "fingers trembling") and therapy-speak abstraction ("emotional catharsis") instead of idiosyncratic perception. No dialogue on the page to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; Elara's perceptual filter (flint-sharp eyes, horizon-mapper focus) is established early. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("jagged stars," "oiled veins," "restrained wildness breathed free") that edges toward lyric omniscience but stays within voice-motivated bounds. No head-hopping. Kai's brief dialogue is functional. The piece modulates with pressure in the climb sequence. However, runs of template cadence ("her eyes… scanned," "her fingers itched," "her hands… worked") flatten rhythmic variety in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "watchfully calm," "fortified vulnerability," empirical cataloging. Diction is controlled and voice-particular in the investigation beats. However, register drifts during the memory merge—phrases like "fortified vulnerability, armor and wound intertwined" and "entangled like roots beneath the city" read as authorial commentary rather than Elara's in-crisis lexicon. The piece elides Marcus's physical presence, which could sharpen voice contrast, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("disentangled but etched forever—her guide to unbreakable resolve") flattens the urgent interiority established earlier. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance and tense are consistent. Diction is elevated ("filigreed ventricle," "ethereal tinkles") and purposeful, creating a distinct texture. Dialogue (Elias and Harrow) carries subtext and advances plot cleanly. However, "aptly deliberate" appears three times in identical phrasing, reading as prompt-insertion rather than organic voice. The phrase "vibrant hush" recurs mechanically (opening, mid, close) without modulation, and some interiority ("guilt propelled him") tells rather than embodies under peak pressure, preventing entry into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice strains for lyricism—"drunk philosopher," "gears gossiping steam," "evolution's sneaky spark"—but the register is unstable, toggling between elevated metaphor and explanatory summary ("It was no mere decode; it was evolution in miniature"). Phrases like "irreverent awe" and "steadily curious" are recycled as labels across beats without perceptual variation. Elara's interiority is externalized through stock intensifiers ("oh, the irreverent awe!") rather than character-specific idiom or rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice establishes corporate-archival diction early ("catalog forgotten profiles, prune ghost accounts") and Elara's perceptual bias toward anomalies. However, mid-story the prose drifts into meta-commentary ("word count exceeded; trim back mentally") that breaks the fourth wall and undermines focalization. Filter verbs ("her fixation gnawed," "truth resonated") cluster without voice motivation, and the final paragraph's "sensed absence lifted" repeats the prompt phrase rather than embodying the shift through distinct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne, but the prose drifts into elevated, prompt-adjacent register ("shadow-laced peacekeeper whose calm intuition turned mirrors' glimpses into mended worlds") that clashes with the visceral stakes of a war parley. Dialogue is sparse and functional but lacks subtext: the wraith's "You hoard the beam's warmth" and Thorne's "To end this, we reconstitute what was sundered" are thesis-adjacent rather than goal-driven speech acts. Perceptual signature is weak—Thorne's noticing (eyes flicking to mirrors, fingers dancing) is generic rather than character-particular, and the final paragraph recycles the opening's descriptors ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") in near-identical phrasing, flattening voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is present in her focus on sounds and the parasol tip as talisman. Diction is generally controlled, but certain passages edge into elevated register ("euthanasia tourist," "windborne solace," "fold in patience") that feels more thematic than character-rooted given her stated "loose grip on reality." Dialogue is minimal (Mira's line, Tomas's two utterances) but functional and distinct. Free indirect style is clean, though some interiority ("her motivation burned steady," "patience folded within Liora") abstracts rather than embodies. Rhythmic control is present, modulating from the opening's languid haze to the closing's meditative calm, but certain template stems ("She gripped," "She fingered," "She slipped") recur across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited stays stable on Elena with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("encroaching night," "destiny's quiet ache," "fated enigmas") but remains consistent, though phrases like "intersubjective understanding" and "nurture understanding beyond possession" read academic rather than Elena's perceptual signature under stress. Theo's dialogue carries subtext and specificity ("vines whisper secrets," "eternal clashes that birth beauty"), distinguishing his voice from Elena's interiority. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at emotional beats (close when Elena traces the fragment, wider when Theo recounts backstory), but the final summary paragraph ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion") tells rather than showing her shift through image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elevated diction ("auras through the clearing," "consecration flowed," "existence's frayed thread") clashes with the absence of a grounded POV lexicon or perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and formulaic ("You have bound it," "through edges, not centers"). The prophet and seekers speak identically. No psychic distance control or interior rhythm under pressure. Register drift is pervasive but does not obscure clause-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is stable third-limited but relies on stock phrases ("earnest whimsy," "perceptively calm," "dove gray") recycled across beats without variation under pressure. Diction drifts into elevated register ("transmute," "luminous," "verdant") that exceeds the scene's immediate urgency. The townspeople's dialogue ("See here, where the beam's fatal bend arcs into a bridge of memory?") reads as expository rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation reflects emotional intensity or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited stays clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"weathered innocence," "childlike wonder"—repeated as labels rather than shown through selective notice. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("hemmorhage of heroes," "lexicon would swell") in ways that feel narrator-imposed rather than Elowen-filtered. The fractured sequences (giggle, Latin murmur, tech jargon) are inventoried without rhythmic control; sentence stems recur ("fractured sequences erupted," "fractured sequences surged," "fractured sequences accelerated"). Filter verbs ("knew she must," "saw") appear but do not flatten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct lyric-baroque register ("oil-stained tarps," "barnacle-crusted heartstones," "virgin as youth"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices ruin, decay, and temporal markers. Purposeful compression and elevated diction sustain the voice, but the register occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("tidal remnants of visions ebbing") that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (focus on lenses, chronometers, craft tools) and diction suits a careful technician. However, voice suffers from repeated label-only phrases ("luminous ache" appears five times, "sage" four times, "ephemeral" nine times) that function as template tags rather than evolving interior texture. The brief dialogue ("How?" / "By listening to what falls away") lands as thematic button rather than natural speech. Psychic distance collapses in the epilogue into summary narration ("The Moon wheeled silently, observatory gleaming eternal. Above the clouds, time flowed true. In that truth, he found peace.") that abstracts rather than grounds the final beat in Elias's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narration maintains a stable third-limited POV on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Voice is lyric and elevated ("pulsing stillness," "hymning the mundane," "subterranean rhythm"), fitting the hospice-sanctuary tone. However, the diction often drifts into abstract register ("decisively kind," "execute a flawless goodbye," "core concept made tangible") that reads more like thematic apparatus than Elara's lived idiom. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Harlan's "This was our song" and Elara's "It can be whole again" carry subtext but lean toward the declarative. The prose sustains a single texture throughout, but that texture—elevated, purposeful, motif-laden—does not modulate under pressure or reflect Elara's internal specificity; it remains an authorial overlay rather than a character-particular perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Voice remains consistent but generic, lacking perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation under pressure. Diction occasionally elevates ("fleeting voids," "ethereal filaments") in ways not clearly rooted in Elara's scholarly register. No dialogue. The phrase "quietly deliberate" recurs mechanically as a template stem rather than as a character-specific rhythm, signaling template cadence without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice attempts lyricism but falls into template cadence: "shrewdly innocent" repeated five times, "yearning" used as verb/noun eight times, and identical adverbial stems ("As a girl," "As dawn's first blush," "After any shift"). Register drifts between folksy ("bone setter," "shepherd bones") and abstract ("nostalgic innovation," "reborn from doubt"). POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is thin—Elara's observations could belong to any character. Psychic distance wavers between close and distant without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("zephyr of celestial petals," "pearl of stillness"). However, diction frequently drifts into poetic abstraction that reads decorative rather than character-particular ("serpentine grotto," "blooming zephyr," "reflectively vibrant"). Elara's perceptual signature is filtered through celestial metaphor but lacks micro-level idiosyncrasy. The villagers' brief dialogue ("See…") is functional but generic. Psychic distance remains stable, yet the uniform lyric texture does not modulate under pressure—high-emotion beats (polishing, venturing to village) carry the same ornate cadence as quieter exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara, but the narrative distance is uniformly elevated and abstract. Perceptual signature is generic—phrases like "watchful dreamer," "honeyed hush," and "protected vulnerability" recur as thematic labels rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Kai's lines ("It called to me, like code from a forgotten drive," "your words gave mine a shape I couldn't alone") mirror Elara's register, reducing voice distinction. The prose often filters action through metaphor rather than immediate perception, diluting urgency. No head-hopping, but the narrative stance remains static across emotional beats rather than modulating with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is stable third-person limited, and the elevated register ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo," "lucidly watchful") remains consistent. However, the diction feels ornamental and occasionally clashes with immediate perception under stress—phrases like "inside the whisper of closing pages" and "swirling hush" recur as decorative motifs rather than perceptual specificity. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "could not let her vanish") dull immediacy in peak beats without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent—elevated, lyric diction with purposeful compression ("thistledown," "rind," "drape like a silken veil"). POV remains stable third-limited on Elowen; no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately as the loom activates and the village awakens. However, perceptual signature is generic-lyric rather than character-specific; Elowen's interiority reads as narrator's poetic commentary more than her own idiom under pressure. The villagers' awakening ("eyes wide," "gasped," "mimicked") lacks distinct voice or subtext, and Elowen's dialogue line feels writerly rather than spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with diction elevated and lyric throughout ("auroras frozen in emerald loops," "breath clouding like departing spirits"). The voice is consistent but leans heavily on poetic register that risks distancing us from Lir's immediate sensory experience under pressure. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present (alchemical focus on materials, patterns, light) but the syntactic rhythm is uniform across emotional beats—mourning and ritual receive the same ornate cadence, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose sustains a consistent lyric-meditative register with distinctive diction ("spectral chaff," "echoes trailing like faithful shadows") and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("tectonic groans," "memory's vault") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon for a working locksmith, and filter verbs ("seemed to stir," "appeared to") soften immediacy in key beats without clear voice motivation. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person POV is stable; the elevated, metaphor-dense register—"boundary-lessly," "calcification," "shingled hush"—is internally consistent but drifts into abstract diction that clashes with embodied action under peak pressure ("essence toward the altar"). No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic across lyric fantasy rather than Elara-specific. Filter verbs ("felt the pull," "realized") cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy by −0.3 in Q6.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all through Elara's grief-sharpened attention. Perceptual signature is present (rust-hued light, wood grain "whispering," steam as "genie's promise") but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("hauntingly practical," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The prose texture is consistent, yet the voice lacks the urgency or roughness one might expect mid-carving. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("envisioning," "summoning") are sparse and voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but leans abstract: "chronologically confused," "viscous waters," "spectral echo" read as elevated diction rather than Elias's scavenger idiom. Purposeful compression and lyric phrasing are evident ("Time had always been chronologically confused here"), but the voice does not modulate distinctly under pressure—peak beats carry the same elevated register as exposition. The ghost's voice ("Ghosts don't bargain; they haunt") feels externally authored rather than filtered through Elias's perception, and dialogue mechanics are clean but do not advance subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-specific: Elara's engineering lexicon ("splicing auxiliary lines," "gravity-fed from rooftop collectors") grounds perception. Psychic distance remains consistent. However, elevated register occasionally intrudes—"stoic wonder," "functionally creative mind igniting," "fractal patterns of flow convergence"—phrases that feel writerly rather than emerging from an intern's interior texture under pressure. No dialogue present; internal syntax is clean but lacks rhythmic variation during high-intensity beats.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("petrichor nostalgia," "glacial hush"). However, register drifts into elevated, nearly interchangeable diction ("excruciatingly gentle," "onslaught of sound—or what passed for it here") that reads more authorial than character-specific; Elias's perceptual signature blurs under ornamental phrasing. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the voice lacks the idiosyncratic contour that would distinguish this introverted clock scribe's mind from a generic poetic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.9)
    Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies," "scaffolds where stories propped up illusions") that clashes with the practical task of poling a barge and salvaging wreckage. Perceptual signature is generic: "thoughtfully clear," "trained instincts," "hindsight clarity" repeat without character-specific filtering. Purposeful compression is attempted in fragments like "By training instincts" and "By the silence of morning radio," but the pattern is neither taught early nor paid off at closure—these openers read as stylistic tics rather than voice-motivated structure. POV remains stable but lacks distinct texture; Elias's way of noticing is interchangeable with any treasure-seeker archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering sensory detail through Elias's philosophical lens. However, the voice drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-specific: "his philosophy unfurling like kelp in current," "coax it forth, drawing hidden truths as tides coax treasures from depths." Dialogue is functional but carries little subtext; Kael's lines serve primarily to cue Elias's explanations. The phrase "infinitely patient" recurs four times as a label without modulation, flattening the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and employs free indirect style cleanly. However, the diction frequently drifts into ornate abstraction ("invisible maps where wounds etched themselves," "salt-wind cartography of freedom's boundless gales") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elias's perceptual signature is present but generic; the prose does not modulate with emotional pressure. No head-hopping, and POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, but diction fluctuates between archaic register ("bedraggled tatters," "colossal stalactites") and modern abstraction ("hypothesis," "nexus"), undercutting voice consistency. Key words—"quaking," "hypothesized," "reverie," "bittersweet"—recur in template patterns (e.g., "The air quaked," "Elarion's heart quaked," "palace quaked on") across a dozen lines, creating mechanical cadence. Filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "whispered") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira; perceptual signature ("gracefully alert," fire-attuned senses) is character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unyielding compassion," "relentless as the tide," "harmonize the soul") that reads more authorial than a firefighter's internal voice under pressure. The self-interruptions ("Wait, over—trim"; "No, restart count properly in mind"; "Wait, adjust last") break immersion and signal generative scaffolding rather than character thought. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") appear but do not overwhelm. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and decorative throughout ("luminous skeptic," "defiant hush," "star-dew"), creating a lyric register that remains consistent but rarely modulates with pressure—crisis moments retain the same ornamental texture as exposition. Perceptual signature is generic observer rather than character-particular: "Her heart defied the hush, pounding with quiet rebellion" asserts emotion without idiosyncratic filtering. Voice reads as polished but somewhat interchangeable, lacking the syntactic or lexical specificity that would anchor Elara's unique way of noticing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (sentimentalist filtering through memory and pattern). Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally slips into abstraction ("troubling serenity deepened"). Psychic distance is controlled. Under peak pressure (gear embedding), the prose compresses slightly but remains legible. The register occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("her sentimental heart eased yet forever haunted") that dilutes the otherworldly specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with perceptual filtering through Elias's craft-focused lens (chisel strokes, epitaphs, slate carvings). The prose carries a consistent elevated register—"fractured glass panes caught the fading sun like shattered memories," "thundering calm"—that maintains tonal coherence but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing ("vast iridescent river," "living cathedral of transformation") that feels more decorative than character-specific. Specters' dialogue ("Retrace the paths where sorrows bloom") reads stylized and uniform rather than individually voiced, though the piece does not rely heavily on dialogue. No head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts occur.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The POV remains stable in third-limited, but diction oscillates between vivid particulars ("waves hurled themselves," "hissed like damned souls") and prompt-register abstractions ("ethically diligent," "searing reverie," "incremental absolution") that flatten voice under pressure. The climactic vision sequence relies on past-tense summary ("old Tomas pulling nets," "the rival's widow appeared") rather than immersive present perception, diluting psychic distance at the key moment. Filter verbs and stock emotional phrasing ("his fractured spirit might emerge whole," "quiet peace") reduce the narrator's perceptual signature to generic introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("velveteen gloom," "blithe abandon," "dust-moted starlight") but drifts into overwriting—figurative density appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff. Focalization is stable (single POV, Elias), and psychic distance is controlled. However, diction clashes with the gardener's plausible lexicon ("orchestrated cries," "conceptual repricing") at peak beats, and filter verbs ("he'd unearthed," "he had long suspected") dull immediacy in reflective passages. No dialogue is present. Elision of how Elias acquired the sovereign case and prior experience with the echoes is purposeful but not paid off with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable (close third), and the perceptual signature is consistent—elevated, formal diction throughout. However, the prose lacks modulation under pressure: peak beats ("Heart pounding, he finalized the model") use the same register as expository passages. Repeated sentence stems ("Elias [verb]," "He [verb]") and filter-verb stacks ("prepared to write," "positioned," "held steady") flatten immediacy. Internal thought is often expository paraphrase ("Had he overlooked a variable") rather than embodied perception. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") but occasionally drifts into ornamental register that flatlines under pressure rather than sharpening it. The broadcast lyrics ("dust child, lift your grains to the sky") feel artificial, lacking the idiom of someone who copies orchestral scores. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Elias's professional and personal lens. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("somber marvel," "kinetic elegy"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure: "crystallizing the fleeting emotion into imperishable grains" and "perpetuating the delicate weave" feel more authorial than character-bound. The self-editing fragments near the end ("No, trim later—wait, count precise") break POV consistency and read as scaffolding left on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("jagged spires and choked boulevards," "sedimentary scars," "scraped like gravel in a sieve") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular; Elias's interiority uses the same diction as the external narration. Filter verbs and summary interiority appear frequently ("He was rationally rebellious," "His motivation burned simple," "began to agonize") without dramatized perception. No dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices in tour-guide catalogs (plague ash, astrolabes, logbooks) rather than a selective, biased lens shaped by his philosopher identity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. However, voice lacks perceptual signature; diction drifts into elevated register ("preludes," "canticle," "doctrinal weeds," "thicket of doctrinal weeds") that reads writerly rather than character-specific. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Listen," "Match this," "Now, braid") without subtext or goal pursuit. The prose recycles stock phrases: "traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned," "velvet hush" appear as decorative tags rather than lived perception. Under peak stress, the narrator's internal texture does not compress or modulate—syntax remains uniform and ornamental throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited. Elias's perceptual signature (tasting memories in air, "faint, plant-borne echoes") is distinct. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines to the plants), voice-appropriate and informal. Free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register mid-sentence ("synaptic plasticity stirring not just in minds but in roots and cells," "inexorable, beautiful") that feels authorial rather than chef-particular. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose modulates with the alignment's peak but does not degrade under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elias with clean access to his interiority and a brief dip into Mira's realization. Voice carries distinct texture ("nectar dusk," "venom from a wound," "electric honey") and vocabulary is controlled. Dialogue serves goals and carries subtext (Mira's "No games" versus Elias's evasive urging). However, some elevated diction ("stark facts," "dull ache of repeated failures") drifts from a toll keeper's natural register under pressure, and the riddle itself, while thematically apt, reads as authorial insertion rather than Elias's grandfather's vernacular.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register—"streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"—that coheres across the piece. However, psychic distance is unstable: the narration claims knowledge of the entire bay's transformation and neighbors' internal states ("stirred by the noticer's quiet fervor") without clear POV grounding. Elias's internal voice lacks specificity; his perceptual signature does not modulate under the supposed pressure of discovery, reading as a generic observer rather than a distinct mind.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, anchored to Elara's perception. Diction is elevated and purposeful—"vineshackled," "filament-thin thread of enchanted silver kelp"—though register occasionally drifts into ornate abstraction ("animate lifeless haven," "incisively kind—slicing through her rage with compassionate precision"). Thalor's telepathic voice is distinct and carries subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Under peak pressure, the prose maintains rhythmic control, though some constructions feel writerly rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization on Elias. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent ("grim smile cracking his lips," "rupture: the flawless die shattered mid-air"), though some phrases lean toward generic lyricism ("steps blurring into a golden mean helix"). No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is somewhat character-specific (mathematician's lens on conservation laws, Hamiltonian cycles), but the register occasionally drifts into over-ornamented abstraction ("texture lingered, motivation sated yet insatiable") that reduces immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and close to Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "saffron quiet," "tentative leaves," "conspirators." Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the contemplative tone. Weak points: recurring template cadence ("Elias, methodically hopeful," "the brush's tip," "moon-tipped brush") and filter-verb stack in the vision sequence ("came a vision," "recalled," "watched," "seemed to hum") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. No dialogue to assess. Overall voice is distinct but sacrifices propulsion for texture.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register with purposeful archaisms ("intoned," "luthiers," "sigils") that suit the museum-guide POV and the grotto's antiquarian ethos. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature—"emerald distortion," "rosewater cloying on tongues"—is specific to Elara's cultured filter. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("Pack the loaves!"), and the final shift to omniscient retrospect ("vanished into legend") is brief enough to read as intentional closure framing rather than POV leakage, though it does soften immediacy at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register, but diction drifts into generic lyricism ("sickly green glow seeping like bile," "waves retreating like a final breath") without POV-specific perceptual signature. Elias's focalization is stable, yet his way of noticing—"neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration"—recurs as label rather than evolving perception. The narrative distance is uniform; no modulation under peak stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though phrases like "the lighthouse stood sentinel" slip into detached summary at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("hulking silhouette coalescing," "operatic tragedies," "magnetic pull, putrid breath") that clashes with a carnival survivor's immediate cognition under stress. The advisor's "silken rasp" and Elara's own narration share ornamental texture, flattening voice distinction. Filter verbs cluster ("seemed to flex," "promise of oblivion") in peak beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elowen's perceptual signature (cloud-reading, fractal thinking) remains consistent. Diction ("leeward tide prophet," "salt-rimed tattoos," "resonance etched in vapor") is purposeful and voice-specific. However, elevated register ("sketched resonance awakening as vibrations leaped") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into abstract narration, and the prose converges on stock metaphor ("ink spilled across bruised sky") during high-pressure beats. No dialogue appears; filter verbs ("clutching," "interpreted") are acceptable within this voice but cluster without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent interiority. Perceptual signature is present but blurred by elevated diction ("inscribed with pattern languages," "dooming Tortuga Spire to drift faster toward the horizon") that reads more authorial than character-bound under pressure. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, yet some phrasings ("her quietly driven nature a silent storm amid the sunwashed haze") import workshop idiom rather than Elara's lived voice. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent access to Elias's perceptions. Diction is controlled and historically inflected ("vellum," "calligraphed missive," "microscript"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("emotionally rational guardian of forgotten rails") that flattens urgency. Sentence stems repeat across paragraphs ("He lifted," "He drew parallels," "He ventured," "He emerged"), creating template cadence that dulls rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction carries a heightened, archaic texture ("hushed blaze," "quiet pyre," "subtended") that fits the tone but occasionally slips into register mismatch for a contemporary surveyor ("interlaced absences birth new foundations"). Psychic distance is controlled, but the narration withholds Elias's recognition of his own surname until mid-story without clear dramatic payoff. The prose modulates with emotional beats, yet the final paragraphs flatten into summary voice ("No longer just surveyor, he was legend's keeper") that abstracts rather than staying in Elias's lived perception. No dialogue is present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but narrative diction drifts into elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") that clashes with on-page problem-solving. Sentence stems repeat: "Dappled resolve [verb]," "Tranquilly perceptive [noun]," "She [verb], [gerund phrase]" across a dozen lines. No dialogue present to judge. Elara's perceptual signature (logical indexer) is told more than shown; her interior voice lacks idiosyncrasy under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elar's perception. Diction is elevated and lyric—"veined with dream-quartz," "gossamer sheets," "refractive splendor"—creating a consistent voice. However, perceptual signature is generic: a grieving artisan could sound this way in many stories. Sentence rhythm shows variation but leans on repeated stems ("Elar's," "grief," "luminous") and stacked modifiers ("luminous torment," "radiant agony") that flatten rather than sharpen under peak stress. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds steady, and there's no head-hopping. The prose feels purposeful but not character-particular; the voice could belong to any contemplative craftsperson in a fantastical setting. The 9+ gate (distinct perceptual signature) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (scars itching, drone whine memory) is specific. The prose carries distinct texture ("intangibly tangible," "mist made stone," "quantum specter") that matches the SF-lyric mode. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("roiling haze of virtual particles pregnant with power") that feels imposed rather than character-filtered. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The final one-word fragments ("Unfiltered, unbreakable") feel voice-motivated and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara; her perceptual signature (sharp eyes, pilot's precision) colors observations consistently. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven, and the pilgrim's gasped speech contrasts with Elara's clipped explanations. However, "perpetually surprised features twisting in urgency" and "brilliant dimness" recur as stock phrases without fresh texture. The prose maintains clear distance but does not modulate rhythm under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is consistent (callused fingers, genealogist's eye for symbols). Diction is elevated and lyric ("cobalt terrace," "sieved hush," "tempered regret") but remains coherent within the narrative stance. However, the prose leans toward template cadence and decorative phrasing: repeated sentence stems ("He'd…," "The…," "Elias…"), stacked filter constructions ("he'd learned," "he'd quelled," "he'd withheld"), and motif words ("tempered," "quell," "sieved," "unspoken") recur mechanically rather than with purposeful modulation. Under peak reflection (the mother's death, Mira's tears), the voice does not compress or intensify; it remains at the same lyric register throughout, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistently elevated and lyric but lapses into therapy-speak at key moments: "uncommonly thoughtful," "fragile timeframe where words could shatter or mend," "true prisoner freed was her conscience." Dialogue is minimal and functional; Kael's lines ("See this," "The false key that birthed our feud") read as exposition rather than goal-driven subtext. Focalization is stable single-POV. Diction is ornate throughout, with runs of abstract register ("furrowed hush," "untether not just prisoners, but the chains of grudge") that drift from immediate perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Elias. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("salt-soaked grace," "pinpoint light") that remains consistent but trends toward writerly distance rather than Elias's sailor idiom. The phrase "merrily melancholic" recurs as a tonal descriptor but lacks embodied contradiction in his actions—he grins, hums, laughs, all in the same affective register. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration occasionally claims certainty beyond what Elias can know in the moment ("Tonight marked when expectations collapsed"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present in the pole-counting and compass-handling, but syntactic variety is limited by repetitive participial openers and "as" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited (Jax), and the voice carries a consistent lyric register ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("calcified heart," "hollow shell," "walking void") that labels rather than filters through Jax's specific perception. Elara's dialogue—none—and Jax's single line ("This place... it's the labyrinth of choices") feel expository rather than goal-driven. The prose is controlled but generic; no perceptual signature distinguishes Jax's way of noticing from a neutral narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose cycles through elevated fantasy register—"cosmic intimacy," "stellar harmonies," "veil's unyielding"—without grounding in Elara's particular perceptual signature. Interiority is told: "Her pulse quickened," "reluctance gripped her," with no embodied contradiction or sensory specificity. Repeated stock constructions: "paradoxically steady" appears four times as a label, "cosmic intimacy" three times. No dialogue; single POV is maintained, but the voice reads generic high-fantasy rather than character-distinct. The final paragraph strings together theme claims instead of image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with strong sensory texture ("choking beauty," "velvet noose," "milk-warm dawns"), and focalization remains stable in close third. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethereal light," "opulent haze," "fragmented life whole") that feels imposed rather than filtered through Lirien's exhausted, post-birth state. Key moments—"Willingly perplexed, she refused to parse the riddles cleanly"—tell the stance rather than enacting it through perceptual choices. The narrative voice reads more like poetic commentary than embodied consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated academic register ("alchemical integration," "spectral fireflies," "nascent light") that jars against the ghostly-hologram focalizer. Interiority is told via therapy labels ("guilt for surviving them, envy of their fleeting passions") rather than perceptual signature. The line "her tone remained ghostly resolve—unyielding, otherworldly determination" is meta-narration that explains voice instead of embodying it. Elara's one line of dialogue—"I will not fight you"—is declaration without subtext or goal-driven friction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans heavily ornate ("destitute philanthropist," "inexorable pull," "velvet breath") and clusters purple phrasing in nearly every paragraph ("vibrant hush," "whispering hush," "slow dance," "texture of transformation"), creating register drift from the scene's immediacy. Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices light, coincidence, transformation—but the voice converges toward stock lyricism under pressure rather than tightening with character-specific idiom. Dialogue appears minimally (one line: "To share the light"), so most voice issues reside in narration. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final summative turn ("he stood renewed") asserts closure rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("winking hush," "velvet gloves," "sly grin") throughout, creating a consistent stylized texture but little modulation under pressure—peak beats (vault unlocking, ally handoff) maintain the same ornate register as exposition. Elara's perceptual signature is generic competence without character-specific bias in what she notices. Brief dialogue with Mira ("Forty-seven northeast, at the hush of one") is functional but carries no subtext or goal pursuit beyond information transfer. Filter verbs ("she traced," "she withdrew") cluster in high-density passages without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with consistent psychic distance. The prose establishes a distinct textural voice in the opening ("sea whispered secrets," "living smoke"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "Fibonacci spirals, golden ratios, fractals echoing the aurora's folds" reads more like exposition than Kael's lived perception. No dialogue appears, appropriately so given the solitary context. The compression in the final third (one-line paragraphs) serves the accumulative design but sacrifices some rhythmic control, with repeated stems like "Promise lingered no longer; it lived" and "Sacred patterns, at last his own."

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice sustains an elevated, lyric register throughout with consistent diction ("storm-kissed," "rarefying the air," "furiously tranquil") and a perceptual signature that privileges metaphor and aesthetic observation. POV distance is stable (close third on Elias), with no head-hopping. However, the prose suffers from uniform syntactic patterns and relentless figurative density that flattens urgency: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor regardless of beat pressure, creating a static sonic texture. Elias's interior voice reads as authorial rather than character-particular—his lexicon and perceptual filters are generic "poet" rather than idiosyncratic to this individual under this stress.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice shows textural control with elevated diction and syntactic variety, but perceptual signature is generic—Elias's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Dialogue pursues goals but carries minimal subtext; both characters speak in equally articulate, philosophical register without distinction. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("suspected," "murmured") dull immediacy at key beats. Under peak stress (the duel), prose remains decorative rather than compressing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.2)
    POV remains stable third-person on Elias with no head-hopping, but perceptual signature is generic poetic register ("luminous fracture," "anarchy twisted into art") rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue between Elias and Mira ("do you always reinvent yourself with the calendar?" / "Monthly molt") reads as expository rather than goal-driven or subtext-laden. Repeated phrases ("luminous fracture," "forge beauty") across narrative and interior voice flatten distinctness. The prose texture is elevated but uniform, lacking modulation under peak stress or character-particular diction that would ground the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, and perceptual signature is consistent: Elias perceives the world through musical metaphors ("arbor groaning like a colossal organ," "melodies laced with resolve"). Diction is elevated and poetic, fitting a wistful artist, though occasionally slips into generic lyric register ("seductive shadows," "violet horizon") that could belong to any voice. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, compressing during the climb and expanding at the refuge. Psychic distance remains close; no unmotivated POV leakage. The final "strategically creative" label feels like prompt-echo rather than lived idiom, and "steely longing" recurs as a formula rather than evolving texture, but the voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose repeatedly uses elevated diction that reads ornamental rather than character-particular ("empirically whimsical," "petrichor promise," "luminous doubt"). Elara's perceptual signature is weak—her "reality checker" tools and empirical rigor are told labels, not filters that shape what she notices. The Guardian's dialogue ("By empirical weave and whimsical thread, waken!") sounds like prompt echo rather than character voice. Under peak stress, register remains uniform and decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices mist, sky, trees without character-specific bias. Hiroshi's dialogue ("Behold the ghost ship's compass," "Diffuse further") reads as exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("filigreed threads," "spectral galleon") that clashes with emotional immediacy. Psychic distance remains consistent, but voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure—syntax is uniform across calm and climactic beats. The orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) caps Q6 at 7.8, but execution issues lower the score within that range.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent mix of scientific lexicon and lyric description that suits a neutron star researcher filtering the world through patterns and decay. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how Elena notices structure, husks, and pulses. Recurrent phrasing like “preprocesses reality” and reiterations of similar abstractions slightly flatten the rhythm and verge on conceptual sloganeering. Still, POV control is clean and the narrative stance modulates appropriately with her evolving humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a clear lyrical texture built on recurring motifs of light, resonance, and adaptation. Diction and rhythm largely suit a meditative, speculative fable and remain consistent across high and low-pressure beats. At times, the elevated register verges on homogenizing Elara’s interiority into generalized poetic narration rather than a fully idiosyncratic mind. Nonetheless, POV control is clean, with no leakage or unexplained shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that suits the speculative, quasi-mystical premise without losing clarity. Diction like “silently expressive” and “unshaken marvels” recurs as motif rather than mere redundancy, and the narrative distance remains stable around Elara. There is no head-hopping despite group presence, and the modulation from descriptive calm to heightened stakes during Kai’s outburst is smooth. At times the register becomes slightly generalized or abstract, limiting how sharply individual perception cuts through the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically rich yet controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature anchored in Elias’s weary, tactile awareness of the drowned library. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, and the narrative distance stays steady, never slipping into omniscient explanation. Though highly stylized, the register fits the mythic, underwater-gothic mode and never jars against the character. A slight modulation toward harsher, more fragmented rhythms at peak pressure might further underline emotional strain.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with consistent diction and a gentle, ritualistic cadence that matches the material. Dialogue is slightly elevated yet coherent and goal-driven (Mira persuading, Tomas resisting then joining, Lena claiming her role). Psychic distance stays stable; we’re close to Mira conceptually even when segments focus on others, without disorienting head-hopping. The tonal sameness across speakers flattens character-specific idiolect somewhat, especially for Lena and Tomas.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lush, mystical lexicon that suits Elias’s sensibility and the occult apparatus he uses. Phrasing like “pilgrim of sparks,” “foggy lucidity,” and the detailed attention to light and inversion give the narrative a distinct texture. There are occasional dips into generalized spiritual diction (“inner fire,” “healing from within”) that feel less idiosyncratic than the best lines. Overall, POV control is clean and the rhythmic modulation across the scene supports the mood and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled, consistently lush, and clearly filtered through Elias’s visionary, mathematical, and grief-driven mind. Lexicon choices like “hyperbolic geometries,” “pseudospherical helices,” and “retrocognitive” align with his specialized obsessions, giving the narration a distinctive texture. The psychic distance stays stable in a close third, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The main limitation is tonal uniformity in the lyric intensity, which sometimes blunts modulation across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person narration has a consistent elevated, slightly lyrical diction that suits the dystopian-fable mode. Phrases like “cotton candy ghosts” and “chains discarded like old skin” demonstrate a controlled, evocative voice. There is some repetition of signature phrases (“staggering grace,” “patiently strategic”) that begins to feel like a tic rather than development. Nonetheless, POV distance is steady, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature—synesthetic hearing of color, technical yet mythic diction, and a preoccupation with absences and silences. Rhythm and syntax mostly support mood, and the elevated register fits a solitary, obsessive inventor in a strange environment. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; interiority and description share a unified texture. Occasionally the lyricism risks uniformity, but it never fully drifts into generic or mismatched register.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical third-person, with a distinct preoccupation with light, color, and coded perception that matches Elara’s obsessions. Psychic distance remains steady and controlled; we never abruptly leave her sensorium or knowledge state. Diction is elevated but coherent for the quasi-fantastical milieu, and patterned phrases (“luminous disbelief,” “illuminated moments”) teach their own rhythm. While the lushness risks monotony in places, it largely supports tone and theme rather than sliding into generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice—lyric third with mock-epic flourishes and Elias’s self-narration—is distinctive and consistent. Diction choices like “Lo, the heart of earth yields its molten soul” and “weighty lightness” feel intentional and character-inflected rather than generic. At times the elevated register risks over-saturation, flirting with pastiche more than layered depth. Still, POV control is clean and the voice is a clear asset.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The close third-person voice on Elara is generally stable and suited to the material, with some strong rhythmic sentences and a coherent internal lexicon. However, several moments read like out-of-character editorial intrusion or drafting notes (“No—word count overrun, but adjust:”, “Actually:”, “But precisely:”), breaking immersion and POV confidence. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract/philosophical register that feels less organic under peak stress. Dialogue is brief but serviceable, lacking much subtext or individualized idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrically consistent for most of the piece, with controlled, ornate diction that matches the mythic-fantastic mode, and the oracle’s dialogue is distinct enough from the narration. Yet the same elevated register sometimes bleeds into dialogue in ways that flatten character distinction. More damagingly, the sudden meta lines about word count and adjustment shatter POV integrity and tonal continuity. This break prevents the voice from feeling fully controlled or publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice strikes a distinctive blend of mechanical precision and lyricism (“servos whirring,” “mundane mysticism,” “quiet alchemy”), which suits a contemplative robot POV. Lexicon and phrasing mostly stay plausible for a sentient machine with upgraded cognition, and the repeated “remarkably composed” motif provides tonal continuity. Some abstraction and elevated diction verge on generic SF-poetic, but they don’t break coherence or clarity. POV remains stable and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and consistently lyrical, with a clear affinity for sensory and metaphoric description that suits the setting. Occasional quasi-omniscient touches (hearing her “buried grief” via whispers) are in keeping with the story’s magical-realist frame and don’t break coherence. Still, repeated phrase structures and favored abstractions (“ambiguously clear,” “resonant hush,” “transparency”) give the voice a faintly patterned, non-human smoothness. Dialogue is essentially absent, which fits the “after words” concept but also limits opportunities for sharper, character-distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinctively lush without losing basic clarity, with strong phrases like “specter of the earth itself” and “flowers rioted in scarlet defiance.” POV is stable and the occasional dialogue is serviceable, if somewhat expository. The diction maintains a consistent elevated register that suits the quasi-mythic tone. At peak beats, the auditors’ lines lean toward declarative explanation, but overall the voice feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the SF setting and Elara’s quasi-poetic obsession. Phrases like “mechanically warm touch” and “twilight…like a velvet shroud” establish a recognizable texture, and POV slips are minimal. However, at emotional peaks the narration sometimes tips into generalized abstraction (“time’s sideways dance”) rather than staying tethered to Elara’s particular perception. Dialogue is sparse and functional but unremarkable, doing little to deepen voice distinction between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly lush, and well-suited to a musician haunted by a spectral diva; diction and rhythm generally feel controlled and intentional. Repetition of key phrases (“in-between spaces,” “wordless conversation,” “lanterns”) functions as motif rather than artifact, supporting the accumulative texture. There’s minor sameness in sentence music and some familiar constructions, but no true head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall, the narrative voice feels distinct enough to carry the premise without distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is coherent and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature centered on periphery, sway, and atmospheric detail. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent with the piece’s lyric ambitions and Elara’s role as an oracle, and there are no POV slips or unjustified knowledge leaps. Rhythms modulate reasonably—longer, ornate sentences dominate but are occasionally balanced by shorter, grounding beats. The main constraint on a higher score is that the lyricism is fairly uniform in register; there’s little modulation between fever-haze, realization, and acceptance beyond content.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—phrases like “drowsy alertness” and “predatory sharpness” are character-colored and consistent with Jax’s temperament. The modulation from investigative cool to haunted clarity is smooth, and the psychic-show snippets are integrated without jarring register shifts. POV boundaries are respected; we stay inside Jax’s perceptual and conceptual frame even when dealing with big abstractions. A few lines veer toward authorial summary rather than lived perception, but they don’t disrupt the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to the keeper yet slightly elevated, with a distinct, incantatory rhythm suited to the mythic, timeless setting. Diction (“congealed night,” “regenerative silence,” “seasons drifted”) is controlled and pattern-consistent, teaching its lyric mode early and sustaining it without head-hopping or register slips. The modulation from library to burrow to refuge adjusts cadence—burrowing passages compress, the refuge slows—without losing coherence. Even without dialogue, the narrative stance feels specific rather than generic, anchored in the keeper’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is generally consistent and lyrical, with a gentle, wind-like cadence that suits Elias and the setting. Some diction choices and metaphors feel more like an authorial lyric register than a character-specific perceptual signature, but they don’t break POV logic. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, and Lila’s single spoken line feels age-appropriate and earned. Overall, the voice is pleasant and controlled, if somewhat polished and homogenous in emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and texturally distinct, with consistent diction (“bronze quiet,” “lumen-orbs,” “dreamless void”) that suits the setting and stakes. Focalization stays close enough to Thorne to feel character-inflected while retaining an almost mythic narrative distance. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with patterned phrasing that feels intentional rather than mechanical. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates slightly as discoveries deepen without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person POV is stable, with a consistent elevated, slightly gothic diction that fits the setting. The narrative voice has texture (“familiar enigma of solitude,” “transpose life into a new key”) and maintains distance appropriate to a fable-like spy tale. At times the register drifts toward purple and generalized metaphor rather than closely filtered perception, which flattens Elias’s individual sensibility. Dialogue is brief but serviceable, though the spies’ single line feels somewhat generic for professional operatives.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture grounded in paradox, repetition, and ritualistic cadence. Third-person close focalization stays steady on Elias, and rhetorical terminology (anaphora, chiasmus, zeugma) fits the chosen conceit. Patterned elision and looping syntax are taught early via the loop-pedal motif and then meaningfully developed. At times, the elevated diction risks feeling more authorial than character-anchored, but it remains coherent within this stylized frame.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that favors musical and reflective imagery. Diction and rhythm match Elara’s interior world and modulate well as the ritual intensifies—sentences lengthen into swells that echo musical crescendos. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the single line of dialogue feels in keeping with the overall texture. A few repeated phrases are clearly intentional motifs rather than artifacts, and they don’t disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and confident, with a consistent elevated, lyric-fantastical register that suits the premise. Phrases like “procedural generation” and “algorithms of fate” add a distinctive, game-informed flavor, though they occasionally jar against the otherwise mythic tone. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains reasonably controlled, though interior access often defaults to conceptual labels rather than character-colored perception. Some diction and constructions (“periodically eternal cycles,” “labyrinth of self”) feel more like prompt echoes than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to the sensory-strange world of vibrated music and mirrored silences. Diction and rhythm show deliberate control, with recurring phrases (“faint rustle of turning seasons,” “filament of hush”) establishing a chant-like cadence. POV distance stays coherent around Elara, with only light, external access to others’ reactions. At times the lyrical register edges toward uniformity, but it never breaks plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is mostly steady, with scientific lexicon (“barometric pressures,” “anemometers,” “theodolite”) plausibly matching a meticulous observer and giving the prose a textured, slightly formal feel. Her way of noticing—vectors, micro-vortices, storm logs—acts as a perceptual signature. A few phrases (“credibly curious,” “progressed laterally,” “weaponized carrier pigeons”) read more like imposed prompt language than organic interior phrasing, slightly straining naturalness. Overall, though, POV control is clean and the narrative stance is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the subject, with a consistent perceptual signature keyed to light, crystal, and scent. Syntax modulates with emotion—the prose tightens somewhat under peak grief without losing its ornamental texture. Register stays coherent; the few technical phrases (“unique terpenes mimicked neurotransmitters”) still feel anchored in the story’s quasi-scientific, fantastical milieu. There is minimal exposition and no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is coherent, lush, and confidently lyric, maintaining a consistent psychic distance close to Elias while allowing some elevated diction that plausibly fits a poet. Patterned phrasing (e.g., “ethically playful,” “texture of time”) works thematically and helps teach the textural/accumulative mode. At times the register veers toward uniform high-poetic cadence that flattens modulation across beats, but it never becomes confusing or technically sloppy. The internal perspective and narrative stance remain stable and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice has a clear, lyrical texture with controlled repetition and a consistent sensibility; phrases like “lost green roar” and “silver dreams” show a distinct ear. Psychic distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue reads naturally within this heightened register. At times the diction drifts into abstract, slogan-like constructions (“In magnificent simplicity, life unfinished bloomed eternal”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise grounded lyricism. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong but could benefit from a touch more restraint at peak thematic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a professional of emotion and scent. Diction choices like “professionally thorough,” “affectionate detachment,” and the specific fragrance notes create a distinct perceptual signature without drifting into alien registers. Dialogue is sparse but natural and aligned with character status; it serves to modulate pressure rather than explain. Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and consistent in diction, with occasional nice turns like “whimsically attentive eyes.” Dialogue is clear and functional, if sometimes expository and a bit too polished for natural speech. There’s limited modulation of distance; we hover at a similar reflective altitude throughout, which keeps emotional peaks from hitting harder. Some repeated phrasing (“cautious exuberance,” “whimsically attentive”) and slightly purple constructions hint at a crafted but not yet distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear taste for luminous, quasi-mythic phrasing that suits the speculative setting. POV control is steady around Elara, and the limited dialogue feels coherent with the elevated narration, if slightly formal. Rhythm and diction modulate decently with emotional beats, especially as the search culminates at the arbor. The main limitation is a relative sameness of register—few shifts in texture that might sharpen key turns or distinguish character voices more strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice blends scientific attentiveness with lyrical, almost musical diction in a way that feels consistent with a natural history illustrator obsessed with resonance. Phrasing like “waters spiraling into a void humming with nascent sounds” and “embryos of roars, whispers unfurling like ferns” gives the piece a distinct sonic texture. POV remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or unearned omniscience; the narrative confidence matches what Elara could plausibly infer. At times the register edges toward high-poetic abstraction, but it remains internally coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person focalization is stable and closely aligned with Thorne, whose perceptual signature blends craft, magic, and quasi-mathematical language in a distinctive way. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with a deliberate, incantatory feel that suits a ritual scene, and the voice modulates gently as he moves from grief to charged hope. Diction occasionally edges toward a slightly authorial lyric register, but given Thorne’s role as a conjurer-analyst, it remains plausible. Overall, the voice is consistent, textured, and memorable without slipping into true opacity or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“sapphire hush,” “kindly methodical”) that feels tied to Elias’s contemplative, hidden life. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from becoming sing-song, and the narrative distance remains stable. Brief dialogue at the end is spare and in-character, allowing the voicey narration to carry most of the weight without tonal clash. There’s a mild risk of the narrator’s language being slightly more elevated than Elias himself would use, but the piece commits to a unified, gently mythic register that makes this feel intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a recognizably lyrical, slightly baroque texture that fits a brooding botanist. Patterns like “circuitously sincere” and the looping syntax help characterize his rationalizing mind, even if they verge on overuse. POV control is clean and there is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. The main constraint is a tendency toward uniform elevated diction that sometimes feels more like authorial style than the exact contours of Elias’s consciousness under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly sardonic lyricism that matches Elias’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, and the descriptive texture reads like the perceptions of a weary artist, not a neutral camera. Dialogue is limited but mostly works; occasional aphoristic lines are a bit writerly yet still plausible for two exhausted, self-mythologizing artists in a ruined world. Psychic distance is steady and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent and confidently lyrical, with a clear taste for sensory detail and elevated diction. POV focus stays cleanly on Thorne and Elara without leakage, though interior access is shallow, favoring description over thought. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, with Elara’s line contributing tone more than subtext. The register occasionally drifts toward generalized mythic commentary, but not so far as to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to a visionary archivist; diction like “curated absences” and “reactively visionary” gives it a distinct texture. Rhythm across the three intervals is controlled, and the collective visions are rendered clearly. Some phrasing feels prompt-expository or slightly over-insistent (repetition of “navigate absences,” “reactively visionary”), which can read more like frame than lived voice. There is otherwise no head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct, elevated diction that suits the baroque, metaphysical tone and Elias’s meticulous sensibility. Sentence rhythms vary and often mirror the sense of descent and motion; the prose maintains a consistent distance without head-hopping or stance wobble. A few phrases risk sounding generically poetic rather than character-particular, but overall the perceptual signature (maps, angles, infrastructure) remains clear. No dialogue prevents showcasing contrast in spoken idioms, but the narrative voice itself is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, speculative tone, with consistent diction and perspective. Sentences have a measured musicality that supports the “unheard symphony” motif, and the narrative stance stays convincingly within Elara’s knowledge and concerns. The repetition of prompt phrases (“courageously kind,” “sculpted space for reflection”) shows through a bit as scaffolding rather than purely organic voice. Still, the overall texture feels controlled and distinctive enough for publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confidently lyrical, and well-matched to a dimensionally-aware immortal in a cosmic setting. Diction and syntax maintain a distinct texture, with recurring patterns like “hushed thunder” and prismatic imagery forming a recognizable signature. There is some risk of tonal sameness—nearly every line is turned up to a high-poetic register—but it remains legible and controlled rather than muddy. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a baroque, slightly gothic texture that suits the setting and concept. Diction like “deathly vitality,” “chemical zest,” and “liquefies his rigid adherence to scruple” maintains a coherent stylistic register. At times the abstractions and elevated vocabulary slightly exceed what a character under acute time pressure might consciously articulate, but the heightened mode feels intentional rather than careless. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and the narrative stance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyric, with a distinct lexicon (textures, glows, refractions, gold leaf) that clearly belongs to a craftsman of materials and time. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled; the narrative maintains a stable psychic distance close to Thorne’s sensibility without head-hopping. The diction (“incandescent restraint,” “cataloged whispers,” “textures of different times”) is elevated but coherent with the premise and never breaks its own register. Under stress, the voice remains composed rather than frayed, which suits the character but slightly limits emotional volatility.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a clear lyrical pattern built around “layering,” tides, and textured perception that feels specific to this protagonist. Diction is elevated but coherent with the piece’s conceptual ambition, and focalization stays stable without head-hopping. The patterned repetition of key terms mostly reads as intentional motif rather than artifact. At times the narration drifts slightly away from the character’s bodily immediacy into essayistic phrasing, which marginally flattens the psychic distance in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a distinctive slightly-lyric texture (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “moment suspended inside the whisper of closing pages”) that matches the story’s aims. The shifts into remembered dialogue are clean and clearly signaled by the hum, and narrative distance doesn’t waver confusingly. Rhythm generally modulates well between description and internal realization. The main limiter is occasional diction that feels a bit more abstracted and essayistic than Elias’s interiority would naturally support at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, readable, and occasionally striking in its imagery (“word spread like fireworks,” “the sea whispered approval”). POV stays essentially with Elara’s frame while occasionally adopting a lightly omniscient, summary mode that fits the fable-like compression. The diction is consistent, though it sometimes drifts toward promotional or sloganic language that feels less like Elara’s inner texture and more like authorial commentary. Dialogue is sparse but functional, largely expository rather than layered with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits a reflective, scientifically literate astronaut in 1972. Technical terms (reaction chemicals, camera type) and lyric phrases blend into a unified narrative stance that feels intentional rather than patchwork. At times, the narration edges into authorial abstraction (“dawning hush,” “dawnlit melancholy infused the scene”) that feels more like imposed mood than lived perception, putting a thin veil between reader and Elias’s immediate experience. Nonetheless, point of view control remains steady and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a clear sensory bias toward sound and touch that matches a blind artisan focalizer. Diction is elevated and lyrical but generally coherent with the quasi-mythic tone of the piece, and POV leakage is minimal. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, though some phrases (“magnetic calm,” “whispered story”) flirt with self-consciousness and recurrence. Overall, the narrative stance feels unified and distinct without experimental slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, with a consistent blend of dry humor and lyric description aligned to a seasoned, slightly jaded explorer. Diction and metaphor choices (“If silence had a map…,” “serene predator biding time”) create a clear perceptual signature without head-hopping. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between external detail and close interiority. Occasional lushness edges toward purple but remains mostly in service of mood and character.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, slightly archaic-lyric voice is stable, with rhythmic sentences and recurring diction that suit the mythic tone. Phrases like “wild hush,” “cryptic bell tuner,” and “spectral symphonies” create a distinct texture and the narrative distance stays consistent. At times, the prose lapses into formulaic repetition of its own favored constructions (“Infinitely patient,” “cryptically,” “wild hush”), which risks self-parody. Still, POV control is clean and the voice is coherent and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a consistent slightly elevated, lyrical register that suits the mythic undersea setting. Diction like “gathered hush” and “ephemeral whispers” builds a recognizable texture without losing clarity. At peak stress, the language remains polished rather than fraying in ways that might reflect her physical and mental strain, which keeps the voice from feeling fully character-specific. Still, point of view control is clean, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture built from refrains of copper, hush, and labyrinth, and it holds steady throughout. The diction is elevated but coherent for a gothic, mythic mode and doesn’t break plausibility for the focalization. Rhythms are generally well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching the winding setting. Some repetition of favored constructions and imagery edges toward sameness, but not enough to muddle perspective or emotional stance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, confidently lyrical, and stable in distance, with a consistent gothic-alchemical texture that matches the material. Patterned phrases (“over the hush of winter-cracked fields,” “loving venom,” “mournful elation”) create a chant-like rhythm that supports the accumulative mood. At times, that repetition flattens modulation and edges toward sameness rather than sharpening specific beats. Nonetheless, there’s a clear perceptual signature and no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and clearly tailored to Elara’s poetic worldview, with strong rhythmic control (“From splintered wharf to sacred shore, we thread the tide’s forgotten lore”). Diction stays in a mythic-register that fits the quasi-fable mode and rarely clashes with the character’s implied lexicon. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shifts, and the voice maintains coherence through both quiet description and climactic transformation. A slight tendency toward uniform lofty phrasing prevents it from feeling even more individually idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits the contemplative, enchanted tone. Diction and syntax are generally confident, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Yet repeated phrases (“warmly curious,” “purposeful wandering,” “cautious enchantment”) start to feel like scaffolding rather than organic voice. More modulation in rhythm and a few fresher idiomatic turns would help the voice feel fully singular rather than gently patterned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture and clear futurist-nostalgic bias in what Elara notices. Diction and imagery are controlled and consistent, giving the prose a recognizable signature. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register jumps, and even the single line of dialogue from the vendor bot fits the tonal frame. Occasionally the lushness risks feeling slightly uniform, but it never undermines clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but not opaque, with a consistent perceptual bias (threads, stars, silence, and tiny physical sensations). Elara’s spoken foolishness contrasted with the more elevated, metaphor-rich narration creates a clear and effective distinction between her performance and inner world. Syntax and rhythm show variety and intention, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. A slight tendency toward repeated constructions and key phrases ("echoed silence," "adjacent possibilities") keeps it just shy of a truly distinctive, high-literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to a numinous, spirit-haunted setting. Diction maintains a coherent elevated register without egregious slips into incompatible jargon, and psychic distance stays stable with no head-hopping. Recurrent phrases (“fierce tenderness,” “space where apology waited unspoken”) risk feeling like template rather than character-specific idiom, slightly flattening the perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional at the climax and does not disrupt voice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct—lyric, image-rich, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a translator and survivor. Diction like “lotus-hearted threnody” and “patois’s layered rhythms” feels deliberate, giving the piece a strong sonic and rhythmic texture. At times, the elevated register risks feeling uniformly lush rather than modulating with stress, but it remains controlled and legible. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly ornate lyricism that suits the dreamy, fog-sheathed atmosphere. Phrases like “pensive mirth” and “fold of a daydream” establish a recognizable tonal signature, and POV boundaries are respected. The diction does, however, circle familiar constructions and abstractions, giving some passages a slightly samey, over-polished feel rather than a fully idiosyncratic mind on the page. Still, control is solid and the voice is clearly intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The elevated, lyrical third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual bias toward sound-imagery and restoration metaphors that fits Elias. Limited omniscience slips into Lena’s inner experience during the awakenings, but the move reads deliberate and controlled rather than muddled head-hopping. Rhythms vary and the patterning of phrases like “methodically playful” helps define tone. At times the register risks uniform grandness, giving fewer sharper, grounded beats that might heighten contrast and emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and stylized, with a lush, baroque diction that suits the speculative, conspiratorial mood. Refrains like “candidly cryptic” and inventive coinages (“digital pollen trails,” “hyperbolic curves that defied Euclidean tax ledgers”) give the piece a distinct sonic and conceptual signature. However, the same density of figurative language and high-register phrasing occasionally blurs emotional immediacy and keeps us at a more mythic than intimate distance. Dialogue is sparse but functional and tonally matched to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is distinctive, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm and a clear perceptual bias toward marine and botanical imagery. Psychic distance stays stable, and the elevated diction suits the mythic, timeless frame. Refrains like “shyly unstoppable” and “reef-shadow joy” build a recognizable cadence without causing confusion. Occasional over-insistence on signature phrases nudges toward self-consciousness but does not break POV or tonal control.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility, with recurring motifs (“gently systematic,” glass, foxglove, echoes) giving the prose a recognizable texture. Rhythm and syntax are generally controlled, with cadences that suit the quasi-mythic, atmospheric mode and no POV slippage. Some phrasing edges toward self-conscious (“with that ethereal method, she ignited the action”) and layers modifiers where spareness might hit harder, but this does not break voice coherence. The diction remains consistent with the elevated, fantastical register the piece teaches early.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice on Elara is consistent, with a rich, slightly archaic diction that suits an arcane linguist and this world. Thorne’s dialogue is distinct enough—more grounded and terse—so their exchanges carry believable status tension and emotional subtext. The narrative rhythm handles long, baroque sentences interspersed with shorter beats fairly well, though certain repeated constructions (“carefully reckless,” “cautious exuberance”) start to feel like visible craft seams. POV stays cleanly anchored in Elara; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and colored by Elias’s machinist sensibility and reverence for the site, with a recognizable rhythmic pattern of lush, image-heavy sentences. Lexicon and figurative choices (“stone lungs,” “values woven whole”) suit the quasi-mythic, fable-like register. At times the diction repeats signature phrases (“dappled resolve,” “slyly heartfelt,” “the building breathed”) enough to feel mannered rather than organically modulated with emotional intensity. Still, there is a distinct perceptual signature and no POV leakage or mechanical dialogue problems.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Elias’s perspective, with a lyrical, metaphor-rich texture that matches his obsessive, quasi-mystical attention to pigeons and dust. Psychic distance is mostly well controlled, with only mild omniscient broadening at and after his death, which still reads coherent under an accumulative/lyric mode. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Lila’s few spoken lines feel plausibly distinct in rhythm and directness from the more ornate narration. The repetitions of key diction (“blooming,” “withering,” “trails”) form a deliberate tonal pattern rather than an accidental tic, though the density edges toward over-insistence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyrical voice is consistent, with strong textural identity (“fractured hush,” “featherly determined,” “tree that drank storms”). Diction and syntax create a recognizable perceptual signature, and the narrative stance doesn’t wobble or leak into other POVs. Rhythmic control is generally good: sentence music supports the ethereal mood without losing basic clarity. The high abstraction level occasionally risks blur, but the voice feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical with a distinct “shadowseam wonder” texture, and the third-person focalization around Elara holds with only minor bleed into Theo’s interior. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate and mostly controlled, matching the dreamy, accumulative mode. Dialogue is sparse and slightly elevated but still functional and in-character. The main limitation is relative sameness of register; the voice does not significantly tighten or roughen under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s idiosyncratic worldview (“merry dirge,” “cheerful gloom”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a consistent whimsical-melancholic register that feels intentional rather than generic. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and the voice modulates slightly as she moves from questioning to acceptance. At times the register edges toward ornate, but it suits the piece’s mythic, non-realistic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice carries a consistent, slightly heightened lyricism aligned with Jasper’s analytic but romantic outlook. Occasional omniscient dips into Elara’s backstory and the man’s “abandoned artist days” stretch strict close-POV, yet the stance remains coherent and doesn’t confuse. Diction and rhythm (“calculated wilderness,” “feral energy”) create a recognizable texture without major register clashes. The few lines of dialogue feel natural and economically reveal the nascent bond between Elara and the man.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctive, with a lush, slightly ceremonious diction that matches the mythic-romantic register (“obsidian grace,” “comet’s sigh,” “liquid starfire”). POV is stable; we never slip outside Elara’s perceptual frame until Kai’s brief, simple response at the end, which reads cleanly. Dialogue is sparse but natural in context, and the narration modulates from languid lyricism in exile to slightly quicker strokes as she frees herself and descends to Kai. The risk is that the elevated register remains almost uniformly high, with few sharper, plainer beats to vary texture and underline pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture, with patterned diction around light, mist, and perception that clearly belongs to this consciousness. POV is stable, and the narrative distance stays aligned with what Elias can perceive and infer. Rhythmic control is generally strong, with sentences modulating to match contemplative pressure. Occasionally, abstractions like “noctilucent reckonings” feel like the author’s coinage more than Elias’s inner lexicon, but they don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyric texture—“hard softness,” “silver vein,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”—that maintains a coherent stance on fire, pain, and the natural world. POV remains cleanly with Elias, with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is modulated reasonably well between description and reflection. Dialogue mostly advances goals and carries some subtext (he soothes by revealing vulnerability), though several lines feel too rhetorically polished or mature for the characters, especially Lena. Overall the voice is confident and consistent, if occasionally more “literary narrator” than fully character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, marrying scientific diction (“variables,” “matrices,” “vectors”) with dreamlike imagery in a way that feels particular to a “logical dreamer.” Rhythm and sentence structure vary enough to maintain flow, and there is no POV leakage or stance confusion. The elevated register is stable and intentional across the piece, even under peak beats. While occasionally dense, the voice remains legible and distinct rather than generically poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric but not opaque—with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound and subtle vibrations. Diction like “what walls dream about” and “seismic sorrow” feels native to Elias’s worldview rather than imported abstraction. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re in his head without head-hopping or register whiplash. Occasional repeated phrasing (“legacy’s burden,” “ivy-veiled passage”) brushes against over-insistence but doesn’t seriously harm control.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the material, with a clear preference for soft consonance and repeated motifs (“dusky,” “echoing,” “grace”). Focalization stays close to Elowen’s perceptions without leaking into other interiorities, and tense/stance are consistent. At times the diction edges toward uniformity—similar textures recur so often that individual beats blur slightly—but it remains controlled rather than sloppy. The voice modulates gently rather than dramatically; there’s less rhythmic shift at peak moments than the stakes could support.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and distinctively elevated, with a clear taste for metaphor and ceremonial cadence that suits the fantasy-diplomacy frame. Phrasing like “forever war peace negotiator” and “operatively gentle” risks sounding slightly mannered, but the overall register holds steady. There’s good rhythmic modulation between long, lyrical sentences and shorter, declarative ones at key beats (“Peace bloomed tentative, a fragile flower amid thorns”). Dialogue is sparse but functional, and there’s no POV leakage or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled elevated diction that suits both Elias’s grand-scale crimes and the quasi-mythic ritual he performs. Sentence rhythm varies enough to carry momentum, and recurring phrasings (“fractured grace,” “manufactured drought”) feel like deliberate motifs rather than tics. The narrative stance comfortably blends his interiority with descriptive flourish without slipping into omniscient commentary beyond what his self-awareness could plausibly frame. At times the voice leans into abstraction and stacked modifiers, slightly hazing immediacy, but it remains coherent and character-compatible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyric, and confident, with a recognizable texture of musical and textile imagery. Diction is elevated but internally consistent with the mythic-fable register the story chooses. The narrative stance doesn’t slip or over-explain; it maintains a controlled distance that suits the allegorical tone. Some phrases (“bodily poetic,” “chaste courtesan”) recur enough to feel slightly mannered, but they don’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited POV on Elias is stable and controlled, with a consistent elevated-but-readable diction that suits an “urbane calligrapher.” The narrative voice has a clear texture—looping metaphors, recurrent motifs, and measured sentences—without head-hopping or register breaks. At times the patterned phrasing (“meteor hush,” “uncommonly serene,” “half-lit epiphanies”) verges on incantatory repetition, but it remains legible and intentional rather than sloppy. Distance control between present perception and remembered bars is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, blending scientific diction (“iron oxide flecks,” “vector sums”) with mythic and occult language in a way that fits an “esoteric realist.” Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with lush but legible sentences that maintain a consistent psychic distance from Elara. The narrative stance remains stable and confident, and the patterned phrases (“blushing stillness,” “transiently rooted”) read as intentional leitmotifs rather than tics. Overall, the voice feels singular and well-matched to the material without slipping into incoherent register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive blend of technical vocabulary (“lost wax caster”) and incantatory phrasing that fits Elara’s mindset. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. At times, the elevated diction edges toward uniform rapture, flattening modulation across beats, but it remains coherent and legible. The voice feels like a deliberate stylistic stance rather than generic fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive texture—lyric, slightly archaic, and image-saturated—that remains consistent and suits a seer caught between times. Recurrent phrases (“ethereal grit,” “precisely playful”) build a recognizable sonic pattern and tonal unity. At times, the elevated diction and conceptual language (“conceptual repricing”-like formulations, “equations of chaos”) feel more like authorial overlay than Elara’s lived idiom, distancing us slightly from her interior. Still, POV control is stable, with no head-hopping, and the voice modulates enough at the climax to land the shift into wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly ornate lexicon that fits an introspective astronomer in a hybrid-science-mystic world. Repetition of certain phrases (“empirically ironic,” “reimagined,” “dusky”) risks feeling mannered but does create a recognizable texture. POV boundaries are clean and the narrative stance stays consistent in time and knowledge. The voice is strong but not yet so singular or rhythmically controlled under pressure as to reach elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear pattern of pairing abstract concepts (“cellular memory,” “shifting grace”) to concrete ritual action (winding the box, reality warping). POV distance is mid-range third-person with some slight omniscient framing, but it remains stable enough and suits the quasi-mystical setting. Rhythms and diction feel intentional, though occasionally they veer toward uniform solemnity, which can flatten dynamic contrast. There’s little spoken dialogue, but the silence is a deliberate stylistic choice that reinforces the sanctuary’s atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the subject, with controlled repetition and motif-building around glass, fog, and frost. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate and consistent with Elias’s craft-focused perception without straying into clinical or academic registers. POV stays cleanly with Elias’s knowledge and attention; there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. Under emotional intensity, the prose tightens in cadence without losing clarity, especially in the synchronized breathing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated and lyrical but not incoherent, with a clear perceptual bias toward craft, stone, and growth. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences carry a textured cadence that suits the quasi-mythic setting. Dialogue is generally natural and purposeful, with Lila’s sharper, skeptical tone contrasted against Elias’s gentler persistence, though a few lines carry more exposition than subtext. Psychic distance remains stable and appropriate, avoiding head-hopping or unexplained omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person, close-ish voice is stable, lyrically minded, and often striking in its diction (“petals unfurling in ethereal glows under starlit vacuum,” “mirror-fractured void”). Repeated phrases like “simply complicated” and “brightened disquiet” give the piece a deliberate, incantatory rhythm that matches the recursive premise. Yet the voice leans toward uniform abstraction; emotional and sensory registers don’t modulate much under pressure, which keeps Elara’s perspective from feeling fully individuated rather than generally poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is lush and musical, with recurring sound and music imagery that create a distinct texture; it generally maintains a consistent third-person focus around Elara. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying exposition and stakes without glaring unnaturalness. However, the late meta-asides (“But wait, trim back—actual count must fit… [Word check internal.]”) abruptly fracture the established voice and POV, reading as out-of-story scaffolding. This break significantly undermines the piece’s otherwise confident stance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited, lyrical voice is consistent and recognizable, with a strong taste for lush metaphor and patterned phrasing. The narrative maintains a stable focalization through Elara, and the chimera’s brief spoken lines fit the established register. Recurrent phrases (“blissfully aberrant,” “trapped freedom,” “unkindled solace”) build a deliberate incantatory texture but verge on self-quotation, slightly flattening rhythmic variety. Overall, the voice feels controlled and intentional, if occasionally more abstract than the emotional stakes warrant.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is mostly steady and apt: slightly elevated, tactile, and shaped by an archivist’s methodical sensibility, with consistent diction and sensory bias. The single line of dialogue suits Elara’s warmth and curiosity. But the abrupt intrusion of meta-narratorial asides about word count and “Elara’s tale ends” breaks the established POV stance, reading as authorial artifact rather than something grounded in her consciousness. That slippage keeps the voice from feeling fully controlled at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture (e.g., “petals of hush unfurling like frost flowers”) that matches the mythic tone. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent with the quasi-sacred, ritualized frame, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Repeated locutions like “hammered repose” and “gently luminous” read more as intentional leitmotifs than as tics, though they verge on overuse. Overall, the POV control and sonic patterning are strong enough for high-tier magazine consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and has a distinct lyrical texture (“a thistle-blown echo of lost grandeur,” “a shard of hush”). Diction and rhythm match the quasi-mystical SF setting and Elara’s contemplative temperament, and the retrocognitive passages remain clearly anchored in her perception. There is some risk of sameness in cadence and a tendency toward uniformly elevated language, but it stays coherent rather than drifting across registers. The narrative stance never overreaches what Elara could plausibly infer, and compression of time (vigil nights) is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with lush, incantatory diction that suits a mystic archivist and an accumulative structure. Refrains like “preemptively nostalgic” and “hush” create a recognizable perceptual signature, and the narrative distance stays stable. At times, the register slips from embodied lyricism into essayistic abstraction, slightly flattening immediacy. Overall, it’s a strong, coherent voice with only minor moments of over-explication.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elias’s craft—fire, light, and pattern shape his noticing in a character-specific way. Chant snippets provide rhythmic variation and tonal contrast, embodying the “serious playfulness” and reinforcing mood without breaking POV. Syntax and diction are controlled and modulate well between incantatory and descriptive passages, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the narration leans into elevated diction that slightly homogenizes Elias’s inner texture, but it remains believable for a mythic/fable-like register.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, poised between lyricism and clarity, with a distinct texture in phrases like “fragmented skies trapped in eternity” and “his warm observance weaving empathy into foresight.” Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay in Elaron’s perceptual orbit even as Mira speaks, and the narrative certainty matches his quasi-mystical yet impressionistic foresight. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, distinguishing Mira’s rawness from Elaron’s measured gentleness. Occasional elevated abstractions (“core concept that haunted her”) feel slightly more essayistic than embodied, but they don’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with coinages like “xenial trellis” and “intangibly tangible” creating a distinctive texture that feels anchored in Elara’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, tightening around moments of panic and loosening into more meditative description without disorientation. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice distinction, but the narrative stance is confident and stable, with no head-hopping or register jolts. Patterned phrases (stretch/contract) feel intentional rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent and confidently lyrical, with a distinct lexicon around prisms, hush, and transit that gives the piece texture. POV is stable around Elias with no leakage, and dialogue is functional and natural enough within this slightly elevated register. That said, recurrent coined phrases like “fluidly logical” and “vaulting hush” start to feel mannered, and sometimes the narration sounds more like an external stylist than Elias’s particular perceptual bias. The rhythm is controlled, but the stylistic signature risks sameness over the story’s span.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a clear, slightly lyrical SF register that matches Elara’s role and the “futuristic nostalgia” tone. Lexicon and imagery are consistent (chrome megacities, synth-waves, nano-mists) and the narrative distance stays close enough to feel embodied. Some diction leans generic or slogan-like (“most perilous quest,” “wisely adventurous”), and there’s little modulation of voice under peak stress, which makes the prose feel uniformly polished rather than pressured. Still, the piece reads smoothly and confidently with no POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close, mythic-lyric voice is stable and confident, and the patterned diction around shadows, scars, and thresholds feels intentional rather than accidental. There’s a distinct rhythmic texture that supports the solemn, ritual-like mood. That said, the register is uniformly elevated, occasionally drifting toward purple abstraction and reducing the sense of a specific mind perceiving. Tightening some of the more decorative constructions would heighten the impact of the best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinctive, lush diction that matches the surreal setting and maintains consistent psychic distance. Neologisms and coined phrases (“shadowseam wonder,” “liquid starfire”) build a recognizable texture. That said, the register occasionally drifts toward generic speculative-poetic stock (“otherworldly light,” “inner universes”), softening the sense of a highly individual consciousness. There’s no dialogue to stress-test voice under direct interaction, but the narrative stance itself remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a recognizable, slightly archaic lyricism that suits the decaying-manor Gothic. Diction and syntax maintain a stable register; the narrative doesn’t slip out of Elias’s sensibility in any jarring way. Repeated turns of phrase (“eloquently silent,” “golden shadows”) are deliberate patterning rather than outright voice drift, though they approach mannerism. Overall, the perceptual signature feels unified and deliberate enough for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close-third voice is steady, ornate, and suitably baroque for the setting, with consistent access to Elowen’s perceptions. Syntax and rhythm are mostly well controlled, producing a lush, incantatory feel that matches the occult orchard. However, repeated phrasings like “factually mystical” and some meta-sounding insertions (“core concept of murmured allegiance”) read more like external prompts than a fully naturalized narrative idiom. That slight artificiality keeps the voice from feeling entirely singular and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to an introspective archivist in the 1870s. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a distinct textural pattern in phrases like “tactfully hopeful” and “bureaucratic tombs” that feels intentional rather than generic. There’s some distance between period setting and slightly modern-feeling narrative idiom, but it doesn’t break immersion. Overall, the POV handling is confident and stable with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a consistent dystopian-lyric register and some striking phrases (“the tyranny of indifference that choked free thought,” “a map suggested by fractured light”). POV remains anchored in Elias’s experience even as the narration occasionally zooms into broader exposition about the regime. At times, the diction slides into familiar SF rhetoric and abstract nouns, blurring the distinctiveness of Elias’s perceptual signature. Still, the rhythm is generally controlled, and the voice supports the story’s mood and concept without major leakage or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is distinctive and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses music, mist, and memory (“his breath syncing with the haze that clung to his bones”). Diction is elevated but generally coherent with a mythic, ritualized frame; psychic distance stays stable and there is no head-hopping. At times, repeated constructions (“eerie nostalgia,” “quietly vivid,” “vested hush”) feel like pattern rather than fresh perception, which slightly dulls the impact. Overall, the voice is strong but not yet as modulated or surprising as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a consistent lyrical, slightly whimsical diction that fits the world and Lir’s sensibility. Phrases like “mossy delight” and “skyborne arbor” create a recognizable texture, and the few dialogue lines are serviceable if not especially layered. At times, the narration feels more like an external fabulist voice than deeply inside Lir, which limits psychological sharpness. Overall, POV is controlled and clear, but the voice risks sameness and doesn’t yet reach exceptional distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly formal texture that fits the subterranean, quasi-mythic atmosphere. Diction choices like “uncertainly certain” and “he embodied uncertainty certainly” are distinctive, if occasionally self-conscious. POV is steady on Elias with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance does not claim knowledge beyond his experience. Rhythm is generally well controlled, though there’s a mild uniformity of lush cadence that could benefit from sharper modulation in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct diction pattern (“luminous regret,” “factually mystical,” “kintsugi intentions”) that feels intentionally stylized rather than generic. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping and a stable psychic distance that can flex to accommodate both incantatory description and interior stakes. At times, the register risks purple and slightly abstract phrasing, but it remains legible and emotionally aligned with Elara’s heightened state. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Thorne’s brief line fits the established elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close-third, lyrical voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to sound, light, and bodily sensation. Recurrent diction (“luminous ache,” “modestly fearless”) feels like deliberate motif rather than accident, even if a touch insistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice could risk a bit more variation in rhythm or texture under peak pressure, but it’s already at a strong, publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive lexicon and rhythm, fusing bodily precision with mathematical and UV imagery in a way that feels particular to Elara’s altered state. POV control is steady with no head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts, and the patterned diction (proprioception, integrals, fractals) is consistent. There is some register strain—highly articulated abstractions during peak somatic distress—but her engineered, interrogated mind partly justifies this elevated interiority. Even so, the density of conceptual language occasionally distances us from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-focus lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a strong sensory and conceptual texture that fits the fantastical setting. Diction (“between-worlds translator,” “liminal seas,” “dreamstuff”) is elevated but coherent with the world and Elara’s role, and POV boundaries are clean. Rhythms modulate decently between expansive description and more focused action as she moves painting to painting. Occasionally, the register verges on uniformly lush, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and clearly filtered through someone both technically minded and accustomed to the uncanny (“dust accumulation patterns,” “clockwork spirals”). Diction and syntax are elevated but feel like a chosen narrative texture rather than unmotivated purple prose, and the POV doesn’t leak into omniscient commentary. The single spoken line of dialogue from Theo fits his established calm, pragmatic authority. Minor moments of phrasing redundancy keep this just short of a truly standout, idiosyncratic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with lush, ornate diction that matches the baroque setting and Elias’s ritualistic mindset. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively, especially around the rupture, with shorter, sharper clauses conveying impact after slower, descriptive build-up. There are no POV slips or unjustified changes in stance. The end’s incantatory repetition fits the lyrical mode but risks feeling slightly heavy-handed rather than purely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lush, and plausibly rooted in a “poetically inclined” ex-revolutionary, with syntax and diction reflecting his ornate sensibility. Rhythm and register are controlled enough that the baroque texture feels intentional rather than accidental, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At peak moments, the narration compresses into charged, image-rich sentences that match heightened pressure. Occasionally the voice leans more toward authorial lyricism than embodied perception, but it never breaks coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, consistent lyric texture—“tinkersong wonder,” “covenant of rust,” “imprisoned starlight”—that feels unified rather than stitched together. Diction and imagery stay in a coherent register suited to a mythic, craft-centered fantasy. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the cadence modulates reasonably well between exposition and action despite generally high ornamentation. Some repeated constructions and coined terms risk sameness, but they read as motif rather than accident.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and clearly tuned to Elara’s sensory biases, with repeated lexicon (“petrichor,” “resonant hush,” “hinged”) creating a distinct, if insistent, texture. Rhythm and diction mostly suit a lyrical, mystical register and do not break POV plausibility for this genre. There’s no head-hopping, and the brief quoted line from the guardian leader fits the established tone. Repetition edges toward mannerism, occasionally flattening modulation, but the voice remains coherent and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture built from recurring phrases (“turbine-hum reverie,” “timewoven,” “scaffold”) and sensorially rich descriptions. POV control is clean; we stay in Elara’s perception, and the narrative lexicon, while elevated, is consistent with the chosen style. Rhythmic variation and metaphor use generally feel intentional, not random. The main limit is that the register sometimes tips toward abstract-poetic slogan rather than character-specific thought under stress, slightly flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, close, and lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“umbral tenderness,” “amber pavilion,” “dawning hush”) that feels aligned to an artist’s sensibility. Rhythm and syntax are controlled and intentional, with long, flowing sentences matching the meditative mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; time and focalization are clear throughout. The main limitation is occasional sameness of register—nearly all beats are couched in the same lush tone, with little modulation in texture for different emotional intensities.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and suitably solemn, with a strong perceptual signature keyed to archives, sigils, and symbolic debris. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, incantatory sentences that fit the “searing reverie” mode yet generally remain legible. POV stays cleanly with Elias, including in the retrocognitive overlay (“Elias-yet-not”), and the narrative doesn’t cheat by knowing things he couldn’t witness. At times the diction edges toward uniform grandiosity, but it still reads as an intentional stylistic choice rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and comfortably close to Elias’s perspective, with alchemical metaphors and elevated diction that fit the mythic register. Phrases like “uncorked his mind like a volatile elixir” and “working memory, that forge of the present mind” show a coherent stylistic identity. There is some sameness of cadence and an occasional didactic explanatory tilt, especially around “working memory,” but no serious POV leakage or register whiplash. Overall, the voice is polished and controlled if a bit uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, assured, and lushly lyrical, with a consistent lexicon that fits a venerable scribe steeped in dead languages. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and there’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition. At times the diction leans toward ornate (“velvet disquiet,” “luxurious unease”) in ways that risk calling attention to themselves rather than deepening perspective. Trimming one or two self-conscious flourishes would heighten the voice’s power under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with consistent diction and a strong perceptual signature—cosmic, botanical, and ritualistic language all feel of a piece. Third-person focalization stays steady on Elara without leakage, and the syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm despite many long sentences. At times the register drifts toward grand abstraction (“entropy’s relentless decay,” “disorder molecules aligned in impossible symmetry”) that sounds more authorial than character-bound. Even so, the voice remains coherent and controlled, suitable for a high-fantasy/lyric speculative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent slightly elevated, lyrical register that fits the quasi-mythic tone. Elias’s perceptions are reasonably filtered through his professional and sensory focus (microclimates, bell, wind), giving some perceptual signature. At times the diction edges toward formulaic repetition of key phrases (“solstice hush,” “credibly curious,” “microclimate variations”), which can feel prompt-driven rather than organically voice-driven. Still, POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and confident, with a distinct, elevated lyric texture that matches the cosmic/spiritual subject. Diction and rhythm are largely controlled, and the narrative stance feels anchored in Elias’s contemplative perspective. However, the voice tilts into generalized “poetic” phrasing at times, with repeated constructions and abstractions that feel more like authorial commentary than character-specific perception. Slightly more modulation and concreteness under emotional pressure would sharpen the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to a “tranquilly perceptive” recluse; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. Repetitions like “mute eloquence,” “tranquilly perceptive,” and “contextual clues” risk a faint sense of patterning, but not enough to break the spell. Psychic distance is steady, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, gesture, and landscape rather than exposition-heavy thought.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly baroque lyricism that suits the altered-time premise and Elias’s sensibility as a horologist. Diction choices like “chronosurgeons,” “anticipatory voids,” and “echo-coins” build a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility. Rhythm varies and intensifies around key beats (the capsule opening, the shard’s activation) without becoming opaque. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the patterned weirdness is taught early and sustained to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly attuned to sensory and metaphorical nuance, matching the poet protagonist. Diction and rhythm are controlled and deliberate, with recurring phrases (“burnished hush,” “cobalt lagoon”) forming a recognizable sonic pattern. There is no POV slippage or head-hopping; distance remains consistently intimate-yet-observational. At times the lyricism risks sameness of register, but it does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with recurring diction (“brazen calm,” “architectural secrets”) that builds a recognizable tonal pattern rather than random variation. POV is effectively anchored through Elias’s priorities and knowledge, even though the narration occasionally slips into a slightly omniscient, prophetic register in the future-projection passage. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with denser description during reverent moments and tighter lines during physical work and illness. A bit more textural variation or sharper edge in the language during peak pressure could make the voice more memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“luminous skepticism,” “bronze quiet,” “chemical sacrament”—that feels coherent with Elara’s intellectual yet sensuous mind. Psychic distance is stable, and the narrative doesn’t head-hop even when Kai and Mira arrive. Dialogue is sparse but functional, differentiating them minimally while advancing the core situation. At times the voice leans heavily into abstract, academic diction, but it mostly feels motivated by who these characters are rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Thorne’s sensibility, with consistent diction and imagery. The integration of Eldari, bird-voiced fragments, and ritual phrasing feels controlled and pattern-taught rather than gimmicky. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the elevated register risks slight homogeneity of tone, but it largely suits the mythic, solemn mode.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lush, metaphor-rich, and consistent in its diction and rhythm from opening to closure. Refrains like “wild hush” and “intuitively descriptive” create a recognizable cadence and atmosphere, and dialogue feels in-character, if stylized. Psychic distance is handled cleanly; we remain anchored in Elias’s consciousness even as the prose tilts lyrical. The density of figurative language occasionally risks sameness of texture, but not to the point of obscuring POV or events.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is mostly stable and gently lyrical, with recurring phrases (“echoed silence,” “true north”) creating a recognizable texture. However, repetition and abstract diction accumulate toward the end, where the voice drifts into slogan-like cadence more than character-specific perception. The meta line “Word count pulsed to finality” breaks POV integrity and shatters the illusion of being inside Elara’s experience. Overall, the voice is competent and sometimes striking, but not yet refined enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly elevated fantasy diction that fits the premise and sustains a unified texture. Sentence rhythm is generally controlled, with some nice cadences (“the pocket sundial lid clicked shut, pocketing noon once more”) and no POV leakage or tense confusion. There is occasional purple or slogan-like repetition (“sacredly playful,” “apprentice of wonder”) that feels more like taglines than lived perceptions. Dialogue is brief but in character and functional, though not especially layered in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent lexicon (“luminous absence,” “penumbra,” “interregnum”) and a strong rhythmic control that suits the ritual tone. Focalization is stable around Thorne; the narrative does not leak into anyone else’s interiority or omniscient commentary that breaks the spell. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent and feel deliberate rather than generically florid. There is some risk of tonal sameness, yet the voice remains distinct and controlled enough for high-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built on reflection, liquid/stone imagery, and controlled sentence music. Diction and syntax are steady and confident, with no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. The voice modulates somewhat as intensity increases (e.g., when her visions “cracked open”), though it remains uniformly elevated, which occasionally flattens dynamic range. Still, the overall control and distinctiveness of the narrative texture are high.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct texture built from chess vocabulary and ritualized, almost liturgical phrasing. Repeated motifs (“woven hush,” “fidgeting productively”) contribute to a recognizable cadence rather than simple redundancy, and the rhythm modulates appropriately as he dives deeper into the tapestry. Register remains largely consistent with a slightly heightened, fable-like tone that suits the piece’s mythic frame. It stops short of feeling singularly idiosyncratic, but it is controlled and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent, with a clear lyrical signature that suits the mythic setting. Dialogue is relatively sparse but functional, distinguishing Elara’s playful provocations from the more hesitant youths. The narration occasionally leans into abstract phrasing, yet POV control remains stable and there’s no head-hopping. The modulation between incantatory narration and concrete action generally tracks emotional intensity well.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinct, with a consistent lexicon blending alchemical, mechanical, and marine imagery. Patterned diction (“kintsugi intentions,” “quilting memories,” “dire enchantment”) gives the piece a recognizable signature and is maintained under peak stress. At times the voice verges on uniform in register and density, with little modulation between high-pressure and lower-pressure beats, which can blur emotional contour. Still, POV control is clean and the stylistic ambition mostly pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with lyrical yet controlled diction that fits an introspective, artistic protagonist and a meditative mode. Imagery choices (“quartz that shimmered like captured memories,” “lanterns flickering like dying stars”) reinforce tone and subject rather than feeling random. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping, and psychic distance stays relatively steady. A few turns of phrase edge toward generic-poetic, but the overall perceptual signature remains distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture with controlled, recurring motifs (“screaming tenderness,” “vibrations of intent,” scent imagery) that feel unified rather than random. POV remains stable in Elias’s perception, and the rare dialogue lines are clean and believable. At peak beats, the diction heightens in a way that mostly suits the quasi-mythic tone, though it sometimes approaches purple. Overall, the voice is confident, consistent, and memorable, if not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture, with consistent diction that matches Elias’s haunted, ritual-tinged worldview. Syntax and rhythm vary in ways that support mood, and the narrative distance stays steady even as we move through time and moon phases. The phone voices are brief but distinct enough in cadence to register as particular presences rather than generic oracles. While elevated, the language generally feels controlled and character-compatible rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinctive, elevated diction that suits a hyper-rational yet haunted protagonist in a baroque post-virus world. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with a consistent pattern of dense, metaphor-rich sentences modulating into slightly plainer lines around dialogue and key actions. Dialogue is sparse but functional, revealing the new subtext (Elias can now lie) without over-explaining. The intellectual, occasionally ornate register sometimes flattens emotional immediacy, but it reads as an intentional stylistic choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly keyed to Elias, with a strong perceptual signature in how he notices symbols, gaps, and relics. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, modulating between long, opalescent sentences for atmosphere and tighter lines around key actions (the plunge, the touch, the pinning of the flower). The narrator’s knowledge remains plausibly bound to Elias’s inference; even speculative leaps are clearly framed as his interpretive work. A slight tendency toward overt thematic statement in the closing paragraphs prevents this from reaching the very highest band, but the voice is distinctive and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suits a solitary, reflective map dealer, with consistent access to his thoughts and perceptions. Lexicon like “empirically intuitive,” “geothermal vents,” and “ink residue analysis” helps anchor his professional mind without feeling gratuitously technical. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip into omniscient head-hopping. At times the register edges toward uniformly elevated and poetic, which can feel slightly at odds with the grounded empirical persona, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    The lyrical third-person voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to the material, with a consistent lexicon of silk, lace, thorns, and celestial wounds. POV sticks cleanly to Elowen’s lens, and the few lines of dialogue distinguish her controlled authority from Thorne’s quieter concern. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and cadences often land on charged images. The main limitation is a narrow tonal register—elevated and ornate throughout—which, while intentional, gives little modulation between ascent danger and mystical revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinctive “scientifically romantic” texture—mixing technical and poetic diction—and it maintains a stable third-person focus on Lirien. Some phrases (“directed spontaneity,” “relational gravity”) achieve a memorable idiolect, and the accumulative rhythms suit the ritual frame. Dialogue, however, is somewhat stiff and ornamental, often echoing the narration’s register rather than sounding like spoken language under emotional pressure. Overall, the voice is striking but occasionally too uniform and elevated to fully differentiate characters or modulate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with idiosyncratic diction (“feral nostalgia,” “jaded wonder,” “lightning-scarred tree”) that clearly belongs to Elara rather than to a neutral narrator. Psychic distance is well controlled: the narrative hovers just outside immediate sensation but dives closer at key beats (the envy cresting, the eruption through the roof). There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the temporal confusion is framed as her trait rather than as structural sloppiness. At times the lyricism risks uniform cadence, but it generally supports mood and character.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is a controlled, lyrical close third that stays filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with a strong tactile/auditory perceptual signature compensating for her anosmia. Rhythm and diction mostly feel deliberate and consistent, and the single bit of dialogue (“Breathe between the lines, child…”) lands with character-specific resonance. However, the abrupt meta intrusions at the end (“But wait, the count exceeds…”, “system counts only narrative words”) break the established stance and read as scaffolding rather than intentional POV slippage. That tonal fracture lowers the score despite otherwise solid control.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly Elara-centered, with a strong perceptual signature in how she notices runes, storms, and ritual minutiae. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths that suit the hush/pressure dynamic, and there is no head-hopping or stance wobble. The elevated diction fits the high-fantasy, ceremonial tone and rarely drifts into incongruent registers. At times the narration leans so hard into poetics that it risks smoothing over the rawness of her fear, but it remains coherent and persuasive.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with Elara’s sensibility clearly shaping diction and imagery (tabloid-inflected yet gothic, steeped in music and hauntings). Dialogue is heightened but matched to the supernatural, metaphor-obsessed context and reveals character rather than serving as mere exposition. The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance, sliding in and out of interiority without confusion or head-hopping. Lyric compression and patterned metaphors are taught early and sustained, so the stylistic risk feels intentional rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close/omniscient-hybrid voice is stable and confidently lyric, with recurring phrases like “resounding hush” and “wanderingly exact” creating a distinct texture. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic-cosmic register the piece aims for. At times, the abstract vocabulary crowds out felt immediacy, but it doesn’t break POV logic. Rhythm and repetition support the ritualistic tone rather than read as pure artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a measured, slightly archaic diction that matches the remote station and metaphysical concerns. Phrasal patterns like “fjord quiet” and “eminently peculiar” create a recognizable texture, though they skate close to self-conscious mannerism. The narrative distance mostly stays inside Elias’s perceptual frame, and the modulation from workmanlike detail to visionary description is smooth. It’s a strong, unified voice, if not quite singular enough yet to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—precise technical terms alongside lush, luminous imagery—that fits Mira’s mind and the setting. Diction and syntax are controlled, and the narrative distance stays stable; we never wobble into unjustified omniscience. Dialogue is economical and character-appropriate, with Elias’s explanatory cadence contrasting Mira’s more inward, associative reactions. The lyric register edges toward uniformity at times, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, blending analytic diction with lyric observation appropriate for a professor’s daughter steeped in probability and philosophy. Recurrent phrases (“clover melancholy,” “lucid contradictions,” “theoretically rebellious”) create a recognizable texture without fully collapsing into mannerism. The narrative maintains stable focalization and a confident, slightly elevated register that suits the character’s background. Some lines flirt with abstraction, but overall the rhythm and perspective are controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistent: lush, slightly gothic lyricism grounded in concrete detail (“shadows clung like forgotten secrets,” “trapped stars”). POV control is stable, with a clear external narrator closely tracking Elias’s world and choices. Dialogue feels natural enough and carries subtext—Elias’s evasions and Mira’s mounting dependence are embedded in how they speak. There’s a mild risk of the elevated diction floating above the lived grittiness of the milieu, but overall the modulation of rhythm and texture serves the story’s haunted, subterranean tone.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lush, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility; the diction (“walnut-ink archivist,” “stardust regrets,” “context changes”) builds a distinct imaginative register. Rhythms modulate between longer, incantatory sentences for atmosphere and shorter, declarative beats at key ritual moments (“Now,” she whispered…). The spectral lover’s few spoken lines feel appropriately spare and tonal, avoiding clunky exposition. Repetition of certain coined phrases (“haunted euphoria,” “gently thorough”) edges toward mannerism but doesn’t break distance control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient, slightly whimsical voice is confident and consistent, with playful yet controlled phrasing (“improbable chains linking a ghost train’s whisper to a fox’s howl”). Elias’s jokiness in dialogue contrasts effectively with his desperation, and the community’s politeness is conveyed through small lexical choices (“courteous impatience,” “politely bartered”). The narrative distance remains stable and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. It stops short of being formally daring, but it’s distinct and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensorially rich, and clearly anchored in Elar’s non-visual way of knowing the world, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Lexicon and metaphor (languages as “living scrolls,” notes as “braille melodies”) reinforce the character and world rather than reading like generic lyricism. Rhythm modulates appropriately, with longer cadences in reflective moments and a sense of crescendo as he nears the stillpoint. At times the density of figurative language edges toward uniform lushness, slightly reducing the dynamism of the voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct lyric-scientific texture that feels appropriate to a “celestial signal interpreter.” Rhythms vary, and recurring diction around gravity, bends, and threshing creates a coherent perceptual signature. The narrative stance remains within Elara’s plausible conceptual lexicon, so the elevated prose doesn’t feel alien to her mind. It stops short of exceptional primarily because some phrases repeat and the lyricism occasionally smooths over sharper emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear preference for poetic metaphors (“sign language flowed from Elara like liquid moonlight”) and a steady, almost incantatory rhythm. POV is stable, essentially close-third on Finn with some soft omniscient flourishes around the crowd, and there’s no confusing head-hopping. Dialogue and whispered lines fit the elevated tone and don’t break register, though they can feel slightly contrived. At times the lyricism risks uniformity, but the voice remains controlled and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a consistent lexicon and emotional register that fits Elara’s intense, pattern-seeking mind. Lyric diction (“volcanic tenderness,” “molten lava cooling into obsidian”) gives the piece a recognizable texture, and POV boundaries are respected. At times the high-register, metaphor-heavy style edges toward sameness and slight overload, with key phrases repeating rather than evolving. Still, distance control is solid and the voice supports the story’s aims more than it distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature centered on vibration, color, and bodily sensation, and it maintains stable access to Elara without head-hopping. Diction (“auroral sorrow,” “quantum-laced serums,” “velvet shroud”) is elevated but coherent with the piece’s speculative-poetic aesthetic. Rhythm modulates reasonably well, tightening as her drumming intensifies and relaxing slightly at the closing exhale. At times the narration edges toward uniformly lush description, but the pattern is taught early and remains controlled enough not to obscure action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a textured but controlled vocabulary that suits a perceptive, slightly lyrical maintenance worker. Diction like “pocket-sized prophecies” and “clip-clop… precise and arrogant” gives the narration a distinct flavor without losing clarity, and the physics exposition is mostly integrated as Elias’s reasoning rather than authorial lecture. Dialogue distinguishes Harlan’s bluster from Elias’s undercutting quiet, though their idioms are not radically different. Occasional near-slogans (“To prove whispers travel farther than shouts”) read slightly more like thematic labeling than in-world speech, but they don’t break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the mythic register, with strong rhythmic control and a clear sensory palette. Phrases like “stillwater tension” and “edge of a half-spoken secret” establish a distinctive texture and are reused to create pattern, not by accident. At times, diction slides toward ornate (“spiralingly calm,” “celestial fire”) in ways that slightly flatten distinction between character and narrator and risk purple-leaning abstraction. Nonetheless, POV stance is stable and the voice feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyric texture (“amplified quiet,” “velvet sky,” “forests of second thoughts”) that suits the contemplative stakes. Diction sometimes leans more toward authorial-poetic than character-particular, but chess- and magnetism-inflected images keep it anchored enough to Elias. There is good rhythmic variation and confidence in the descriptive mode, even if it occasionally overdecorates. POV remains stable and modestly deep without head-hopping or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident and lyrical, with a distinct maritime-romantic texture that suits the premise. Dialogue between Elara and Kai feels natural for the world, conveys subtext (“combative tenderness”), and advances both conflict and relationship. Occasional exposition (“It was the era after the Cataclysm…”) slightly breaks the otherwise close, textural feel but does not create POV confusion. Overall, the narrative stance is stable and well-controlled under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct: a slightly elevated, lyric third-person that coheres with the protagonist’s operatic self-performance and the dystopian setting. The pattern of grandiose internal narration of mundane acts is clearly taught and sustained without head-hopping or distance confusion. At times, diction risks being more ornate than this rural widow’s likely interior lexicon, but the piece reads as a controlled stylistic choice rather than a slip. Rhythm modulates effectively around key beats (the blood nick, the talisman’s completion, the final extinguishing of the lamp).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and distinct, with a consistent register of elevated, imagistic language that suits the material. Diction choices like “lantern-moth hush,” “fleeting umbras,” and “paraphrase the world’s oldest silences” establish a coherent perceptual signature. There are no POV slips, and the narrative stance stays tightly aligned with the poet’s aesthetic consciousness. A slight risk of ornamentation crowding emotional specificity keeps it short of exceptional, but the voice is strong enough for serious consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a tactile, sensuous attentiveness that fits a blind/colorblind artist in a craft world. Diction and rhythm are controlled, often musical, and there’s no POV slippage or head-hopping. Brief dialogue at the end feels natural and distinct enough to mark Mira versus Elias. At times the lyric register risks uniformity of tone, but it remains coherent and serviceable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-closish voice is consistent, with a strong lyric signature grounded in synesthetic sound imagery and careful repetition of key terms (“prism-song,” “golden shadows,” “texture”). Rhythm and syntax are generally well controlled, shifting between long, lush sentences and tighter beats at moments of insight. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping; the narrative certainty matches what Elowen could infer in this stylized world. A slight overuse of certain constructions and adjectives keeps the voice from feeling entirely effortless at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled elevated diction and a strong textural pattern of cosmic-mechanical imagery married to grief. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to carry the accumulative, incantatory feel without full monotony. The perspective stays tightly aligned with Elara’s experience even in its loftier formulations, avoiding head-hopping or jarring register shifts. Occasionally the rhetorical weight of certain phrases feels more authorial than character-filtered, but not enough to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a strong sensory palette and a quasi-omniscient tilt that fits the mythic-intellectual subject. Phrasing and diction (“topographic map of madness,” “Fibonacci echo of ancient follies”) feel curated and deliberate, giving the narrative a distinctive texture. Dialogue is brief but functional, sounding plausible for characters steeped in this family mystery, and it advances both plot and thematic exposition. At times the register edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lush, confident, and consistent, with a strong rhythmic control and a clear perceptual signature tuned to history, pattern, and sensory richness. Lexicon and syntax are elevated but feel apt for the mythic, literary register and for a character steeped in archives and incantations. Shifts in intensity (e.g., during the revelation and veil-shattering) are well handled without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the lyricism verges on uniform saturation, leaving little tonal contrast, but it remains legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable texture built on repeated motifs (“softly deliberate,” dusk, petals, luminosity) and a measured cadence that suits the character. POV remains stable and confident; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond what the frame implies. At times the diction skirts purple through dense metaphor strings, but the pattern is taught early enough that it reads as intentional rather than intrusive. Modulation under peak pressure (during the ritual and metamorphosis) maintains clarity despite heightened language.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on animals, textures, and quiet sensory detail. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly well-matched to a reflective, gentle handler in a liminal night scene. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and shifts between present observation and memory are clean. A few phrases feel more authorial than character-rooted, but they don’t significantly damage the coherence of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct lyric texture (“meteor hush,” “cosmic dust settling after a star’s quiet death”) that feels intentional rather than generic. Psychic distance is well controlled; even the more baroque metaphors feel filtered through Elena’s heightened, post-surgical consciousness. Telepathic plant speech is handled cleanly and consistently in italics, without POV leakage or confusion. At times the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical with a strong perceptual signature—“spatially imaginative,” psychometric, attentive to echoes and architecture. Syntax and rhythm are mostly well controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a cohesive tonal register. Occasional abstraction and repeated key terms (“incubate,” “unused love”) slightly blunt intensity by feeling authorial rather than purely character-rooted. Still, the stance toward the material remains stable and confident, and the modulation from mystery to quiet resolution is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to the cosmic subject matter, with consistent diction and rhythm. Phrasing like “shadowed rapture,” “unwritten calendar,” and “silent symphonies” builds a distinct texture that feels deliberate rather than generic. At times, the elevated register drifts toward uniformity, giving fewer sharp shifts in cadence as pressure rises. Still, focalization remains clear and there’s no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, with controlled, incantatory rhythm and consistent diction throughout (“fractured croon,” “wave functions coiling like smoke”). The POV remains stable and legible even as it brushes against quasi-omniscient formulations (“occasionally everywhere”), which read as in-world quantum effects rather than head-hopping. Refrains and parallel structures are used deliberately to sustain tone and cadence. At times the density of imagery risks sameness, but it rarely slips into confusion or tonal drift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and distinct, sustaining a high-lyric register without frequent stumbles. POV stays cleanly with Elias’s perceptual frame, though the diction sometimes feels more omnisciently ornate than character-bound, which is workable given his philosopher identity. Lexical and syntactic patterns (“rustflowers,” “steam-blood,” “probable miracles”) create a recognizable texture that modulates appropriately as the hum intensifies. There is no dialogue to test, but internal descriptive cadence generally supports rather than fights the story’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a mythic/lyric tale, with some nice rhythmic choices (“brambles parting like reluctant curtains”). POV is controlled and consistent; we do not slip outside Elara’s frame in a confusing way. That said, the voice lacks a sharply distinctive perceptual signature—phrases like “gently persistent,” “unused courage,” and “shoreline’s lullaby” recur in a templated fashion rather than evolving with her state. Dialogue is clear but on-the-nose, often serving to state theme rather than reveal character through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that matches the gothic/techno-lyric mood (“seraphically mundane,” “frostbitten hope”). Elias’s perceptions are the primary filter, and even when the narrative accesses fortress logs, it feels like a natural extension of his altered neural state rather than head-hopping. Rhythm varies effectively between compressed exposition and more spacious, imagistic lines. The register skirts purple but remains coherent with the chosen aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient-yet-close narrative voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and tonally consistent, with a clear taste for elevated, almost liturgical diction (“regally unpretentious,” “cascade of silken ruin”). Its texture suits an ancient, mythic setting and feels like a singular stance rather than generic fantasy prose. At times the density of ornament flirts with purple, but syntactic control and viewpoint stability keep it from tipping into confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but focalization and distance remain steady and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical scientific register that fits a seasoned ocean observer. Recurrent phrasing (“periodically eternal,” “moored yet drifting”) reads as intentional motif rather than accidental repetition. The prose modulates with pressure—tapping rhythms accelerate, storm swells, revelation “crests”—without becoming overwrought or losing clarity. There’s no dialogue to test range, but interior description and narrative stance are controlled and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a strong lyric texture and recurring phrasing that feels intentional (“thunderous serenity,” “margin of daylight”). Diction generally suits an introspective stargazer in a half-mystical SF setting, and the rhythm is controlled enough that the prose reads as deliberate rather than accidental. However, the register occasionally overreaches into purple, and repetition of key coinages risks feeling like a stylistic tic rather than deepening modulation. Still, the perceptual signature is clear and consistent through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a confident, slightly mythic register that suits the setting and Mira’s elder status. Diction and syntax are controlled; the narrative stance never slips into unearned omniscience, and the single spoken line feels in-character. At times, the elevated, abstract phrasing (“implanted destiny,” “charged for reconstruction’s next phase”) distances us from Mira’s felt experience. Still, the voice is distinct and coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture, with a good balance of concrete sensory detail and interior reflection. Diction generally feels appropriate to Elena—educated, reflective, shaped by therapy—though occasional lines (“some strike of life,” repeated “somatic markers”) sound a bit constructed or thesis-like. Dialogue is sparse but functional, if slightly on-the-nose in carrying thematic language. Overall, POV control is solid and stable, with no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and recognizably Elias’s, with a strong sensory and metaphorical bias that suits a visual artist obsessed with perception. Rhetorical questions and elevated diction create a distinctive texture and a stable psychic distance. At times, though, the voice tips into uniformity—similar sentence rhythms and repeated constructions—and the rhetorical-question tic begins to feel like an authorial pattern more than organic thought. Still, POV control is clean and the narrative stance fits the piece’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, elevated diction that suits the mythic-SF atmosphere. Elowen’s perceptual bias—toward patterns, wildness, and temporal oddity—comes through in the imagery. That said, some phrasing (“consciously wild nature,” “serene anger”) feels more like authorial labeling than organic internal language, and the register borders on grandiose in places. Dialogue is sparse but functional, serving theme and plot without breaking the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confidently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature focused on cold, quiet, and circuitry. Elevated diction mostly feels aligned with Elara’s reflective, archivist mind, and the rhythm modulates well between long, vertiginous sentences and sharper beats at key turns. There is some repetition of key phrases (“dizzying quiet,” “contraband truths,” “scandalize”) that borders on incantatory; it works as motif but occasionally feels like template reuse rather than deliberate variation. Still, POV distance and access are steady, and the voice carries the story’s mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of desert imagery and moral language. Recurrent diction (“tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet,” “senselessly perceptive”) establishes a distinctive texture, though it approaches self-conscious patterning at times. POV is stable and distance is well controlled; the brief dialogue at the end matches character and stakes. The lyric compression under pressure remains legible and largely avoids unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctive, rich with sonic and visual metaphors that suit the premise. POV distance is steady: we remain close enough to Elias’s perceptions to feel his professional instinct while inhabiting a mythic register that fits the story’s scale. Some diction—especially in the more declarative thematic lines—feels a bit more authorial than character-filtered, slightly thinning the illusion of his personal sensibility. Overall, the prose rhythm and patterning (“feral lullaby,” “patterns break”) are intentional and carry through the climax without sacrificing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice around Elara is stable and distinct, with a consistent blend of elevated diction and observational sharpness that fits her background and intellect. Sentence rhythm varies and often supports mood, and the metaphorical language is thematically aligned with astronomy and journalism. Dialogue is somewhat theatrical, but it has recognizable goals (accuse, deflect, probe, confess) and subtext around shared history. Occasionally the narration leans into a generalized lyric register that feels more authorial than strictly Elara-filtered, but not enough to break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled, image-rich diction (“history’s throat,” “meteor hush”) that feels of a piece with Elias’s world and trade. POV remains cleanly anchored in his perceptions even as time folds and the lab shifts around him. The baby’s digitized line, “Daddy, the stars itch; make them quiet,” is a striking, tonally apt intrusion that advances both plot and emotion. At times the elevated, poetic register risks smoothing over his individual quirk or cadence, but it still reads as a coherent, deliberate narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, maintaining a consistent perceptual filter through Elara’s artistic and socially attuned sensibility. Phrasing like “lilac unease” and “emergent hush” gives the prose a recognizable texture without tipping into total abstraction. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, sliding between external action and internal reading of group dynamics without confusion. The voice feels polished and apt for the piece, though it doesn’t yet attain a truly singular, unforgettable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“warm coldness,” “aberrant mercy,” “arms of steel”) that matches the mythic-apocalyptic register. Psychic distance is mostly stable around Elara, with only modest, controlled zooming outward to the plaza and Kael. While the density of coined phrases can verge on mannered, there’s a recognizable perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy prose. Dialogue is minimal but works when it appears, and there are no disruptive POV slips or stance confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and colored by Elena’s synesthetic perceptions, giving the narrative a recognizable texture and lexicon. Rhythm and diction are generally controlled, with recurring motifs (echoes, colors, timelines) used deliberately to build a lyrical pattern. At times the register leans into slightly generic phrasing for big emotions (“despair’s brink,” “career shattered by scandal”), which flattens distinctiveness. Still, there’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the voice carries the piece’s magical-realist tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, comfortably mixing sensory lyricism with lightly technical language (Damasio, somatic markers) in a way that feels plausible for this character. Repeated phrases (“fractally precise,” “willowglass hope”) function as motifs rather than pure tics, and the rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-directed, reinforcing affection and doubt without overexplaining. Occasionally the narratorial register edges toward slightly purple abstraction, but clarity and control hold.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and imagistic, with a distinctive lexicon around heat-mapping, thermals, and emotional spectra. POV control is clean; we never slip out of Lira’s frame in a confusing way, even as historical information and human memories bleed through. At times the register veers into explanatory or meta (“core concept incarnate,” “factually mystical artifact”), which flattens the otherwise textured lyric tone. Rhythm is generally varied, though some cadences and constructions repeat enough to feel patterned rather than fully intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrically consistent, and aligned with the mythic, ritualistic subject matter. Diction and rhythm are deliberate and cohesive across the piece, with no POV leakage or stance confusion. While the lyric register is fairly uniform (there’s little modulation into rawer or more fractured texture under pressure), it suits the contemplative, accumulative design. The absence of dialogue is a non-issue here and keeps the focus on narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and coherent, with a distinct lyric-espionage texture (e.g., "zephyrs whispered in silver hush," "burned spy"). POV stays cleanly anchored in Elias, and the diction matches a hardened but reflective operative. Dialogue is functional and clear but sometimes veers toward thematic declaration rather than subtextual tension. Recurrent turns of phrase create a recognizable cadence, though they occasionally risk sameness in rhythm and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct, elevated diction that fits the quasi-mythic tone and stays stable throughout. Recurrent phrases (“ambient awareness,” “spindrift serenity,” “percolate”) teach a stylistic pattern early and are reused with some intentional echo. At times, the register edges into self-conscious lyricism that feels more authorial than truly character-bound, slightly flattening the character’s individuality. Still, POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive: contemplative, image-driven, with a consistent meditative cadence that suits a zen potter in a mythic wasteland. Diction like “phototropically bent toward kindness” pushes toward the abstract but still feels thematically motivated rather than academic. Psychic distance and stance are stable; we never leave Kai’s perceptual frame even as the narration becomes more lyrical. Some rhythmic and figurative sameness keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s world of tools, plants, and light. Dialogue is mostly natural, with soft, goal-driven exchanges that suit the tone, though Elara’s lines occasionally slip into didactic metaphor. There is mild POV looseness in the confident reading of Mira’s interior state that feels more authorial than purely inferred, but it doesn’t seriously damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical-abstract register that suits the cosmic, fantastical setting. Diction such as “atomically reflective” and “vibrational resonance” walks the edge of over-technical, but it does create a distinct texture for this world. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and psychic distance stays reasonably controlled. Repetitive phrasing (“By the hum of an ancient stone circle…”) slightly flattens the rhythm but does establish a recognizable incantatory pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical, with recurring diction around “prismatic,” “spiral,” and “quiet” establishing a recognizable texture. POV remains firmly with Elara until Theo speaks; there’s no confusing head-hopping, and the brief dialogue feels natural for the heightened, intimate moment. Rhythm and sentence variety are generally strong, though the voice leans into a slightly uniform, elevated register that blurs individual idiosyncrasy. The pattern of whimsical, myth-tinged narration is well taught and sustained through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical diction with lyric touches in a way that feels plausible for a scientifically minded yet poetic protagonist. Recurrent phrases (“cautiously hopeful,” “ethereal grit”) create a recognizable texture without fully tipping into self-parody. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, particularly Harlan’s blunt ambition contrasted with Elara’s focused urgency. There is some rhythmic sameness in the piling of metaphor-laden clauses, but not enough to break POV control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and sensory richness that suits the mythic, speculative tone. The narrative rhythm shifts appropriately—more expansive early, tightening around the mutiny and climax—without losing clarity. At times the diction drifts toward generic grandiosity and repetition (“vital key lost to time,” repeated “wistful” and “fallow”), slightly diluting the distinctiveness of Elias’s perceptual signature. Still, the POV never wavers, and the voice feels coherent and controlled across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly gothic diction that suits the quarry and cold-case ambience. Repeated phrasings and parallel structures (“furrowed hush,” “mist coiling,” opposites paired) create a recognizable texture and pattern. At times the narration tilts toward an abstract, authorial register—especially in summarizing the aftermath—which slightly distances us from Elara’s embodied perception. Still, POV remains stable and legible, and the voice has enough distinctiveness to stand out.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a strong lyric bent that suits Elara’s idealistic, map-obsessed perspective. Repeated phrasing like “nervously confident” occasionally feels like a label rather than fully embodied voice, but overall diction and rhythm remain internally coherent. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, especially in Elara’s confrontational “Question this,” which matches her blend of fear and bravado. The narrative modulation under pressure (more clipped in confrontation, more lush in atmospheric description) is controlled without POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical bent and a perceptual signature focused on motion, light, and pattern (“fluttering cartography,” “pixelated amnesty”). The bridge-fiddler persona and his observational habit give the diction some grounding, and POV does not leak. That said, the register sometimes drifts into an ornate, essayistic mode that feels more like an abstract poet than a working musician, which can strain plausibility. Repeated signature phrases reduce the sense of spontaneity in the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctively lyrical, with controlled rhythm and a recognizable diction (“dusky harmony,” “polished calm,” “paths circle back”). Dialogue, though sparse, is functional, carries subtext (Raoul’s greed vs. Elias’s warning), and fits the established register. The narrative occasionally edges toward a generalized poetic register that feels slightly above what this specific consciousness might naturally think, but not so much as to break POV. Overall distance and stance remain stable and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistent with a contemplative, quasi-mystical frame; POV remains centered on Thorne with only light, acceptable access to Lyra. Phrasing such as “he healed with words, his voice a balm” and “witness to wonders, they shone” shows a deliberate, lyrical rhythm. At times the diction slides toward generic poeticism, which blurs character-specific perception into authorial voice. Still, distance and stance are controlled, and the prose maintains a recognizable texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated, incantatory diction that matches the mythic-fantastical register. Phrasing like “warlike serenity” and “serene inevitability” gives the prose a recognizable texture and aligns with Thorne’s druidic, ritualistic perspective. There is occasional abstraction and repetitive constructions, but POV control remains tight and free of head-hopping. The lyricism is effective overall, if sometimes slightly uniform in cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and sensorially rich, with a recognizable diction around “cobalt,” “rifts,” “intersection,” and “anxious elation” that feels like Elara’s visionary filter. Rhythm alternates between long, lyrical sentences and shorter declaratives in a controlled way that suits the dreamlike mode. That said, some phrase and structure repetition (especially “purposefully curious” and similar cadences) edges toward sameness and gently blunts impact. Overall, the POV control is clean with no head-hopping, and the lyric mode remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual bias toward ritual detail and metaphoric thinking that fits Elara’s temperament. Diction is elevated but coherent for the chosen dark-lyric mode, and psychic distance stays stable without head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge. Recurrent phrases (“fiercely gentle,” “dusky resolve,” “inlaying meaning”) create a deliberate incantatory texture rather than simple redundancy, though they flirt with overuse. Modulation under pressure—the rhythm quickening around the bloodletting and visions—is effective without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and plausibly tied to Harl: it mixes technical appraisal language with rock-roadie metaphors in a distinct way. Refrains like “Confidently uncertain” and “after the applause” give the piece a recognizable cadence. At times, the narrative register slides into slightly generic uplift (“embracing the unknown,” “forever forward”), which feels more like authorial summary than character-specific thought. Overall, POV control is solid, but the voice could trust implication more and rely less on slogan-like repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a distinct, gently formal, analogical texture that suits a cuneiform translator-philosopher. Diction choices like “Lorentz force,” “charged ether,” and “conceptual repricing of flux” mostly feel motivated by his mindset, though they occasionally edge toward authorial essaying more than embodied perception. Rhythm is varied enough and the lyric compression is handled with confidence. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and there is no head-hopping or POV confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture in images like “her joints whirring softly like distant chimes” and “voice a cascade of ticking echoes.” POV distance is steady; we never head-hop, and interiority is folded into the descriptive cadence naturally. Dialogue is sparse but functional, matching the elevated tone without feeling stilted. At peaks, the register gets close to overtly aphoristic, but it maintains a unified, confident narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly elevated lyric register that suits the meditative, speculative tone. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“resonant hush,” “latent radiance”) operating as motif rather than accident, and the narrative generally respects Elias’s knowledge and vantage. Occasional omniscient-leaning summaries of bunker history still feel compatible with his long experience. The main limitation is a mild sameness in register—always high, always solemn—that leaves little modulation in voice as pressure changes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a coherent perceptual signature focused on mapping, structures, and flows; the diction (“serpentine whispers,” “palimpsest of fellow seekers”) suits a slightly heightened, literary register. Rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanical, and the absence of dialogue fits the solitary, inward focus. Some repeated phrasing (“daringly methodical,” “raw solace,” “alluded”) reads as prompt-echo rather than organic voice, and the analytic, almost essayistic turns at the end slightly distance us from embodied experience. Overall, though, the voice is controlled and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, marrying ornate diction to her dreamy yet cautious sensibility. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to keep the lyricism from going numb, and the register fits this speculative, quasi-mythic frame. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance remains consistent. A few phrasings skirt purple, but overall the voice feels confident, intentional, and coherent with the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinctive lyrical texture that suits Elara’s sensibility and the fantastical setting. Lexicon and imagery (provenance, mulberry ache, velvet, glacial seers) are consistent and character-plausible for a scholar-artist in this world. There is no head-hopping; interior access is coherent and modulates with emotional intensity. The lush register occasionally flirts with over-saturation of similar motifs, but it remains legible and controlled rather than muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, elevated texture that suits the mythic, ritual frame (“radiant hush,” “helix of emerald light,” “a hush within hush”). Focalization through Lirien is consistent; we never slip into other minds, and the diction matches the timeless, ceremonial atmosphere. Rhythmic control is generally strong, with long, rolling sentences that mirror the aurora’s flow. At times the lyric register veers toward sameness and self-consciousness, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic-fantasy setting, with consistent diction and psychic distance. Elara’s perceptions (vines as lovers’ secrets, clouds parting) give the narration a distinct sensibility. Some phrasing and cadence repeat (“vineyard hush,” “kindly decisive”), creating a slight sense of patterned artifice, but not enough to break immersion. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the visionary sequence remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice has a consistent, gently elevated lyricism that suits the premise, and Elias’s dialogue is recognizably distinct from Alex’s guardedness. Phrasing like “sincerely insincere” and “curated empathy” gives the narration a distinctive, somewhat wry texture. At times, however, the register drifts into self-conscious aphorism and meta-commentary, making the voice feel more like an essayist than Alex-bound perception. Despite that, POV remains stable and clear throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person voice has a strong, lyrical texture with consistent sensory and metaphoric biases that feel appropriate to a mystic-scientific seeker. Voss’s sparse dialogue contrasts well with the lush narration, and POV distance remains stable. The main issue is the intrusion of meta-narrative drafting commentary (“Wait, overshot; trim”), which breaks the established spell and briefly confuses stance. Overall, though, the perceptual signature is distinct, and the experimental touches don’t fully derail coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctly lyrical, with a strong preference for textural, mythic diction that suits the setting and scale. POV distance remains stable: we see through Thren’s priorities without head-hopping or intrusive author explanation. Rhythmic control is good, especially in the escalating time-sweep and the climactic flock sequence. Some uniform loftiness of register slightly flattens modulation across beats, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture and recurring phrasal motifs (“brilliant dimness,” “sacred simple”) that feel intentional rather than generic. Diction is elevated but largely plausible for a reflective mage in a mythic-tech setting, and the narrative distance stays stable. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, especially around key beats like unstrapping and mist walking. The main limitation is that the narration sometimes speaks more like a thematic essay than Thorne’s embodied consciousness, which slightly loosens the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong imagistic texture (“meteor hush,” “ink-black sea”) that suits the fable-like tone. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional without head-hopping or stance confusion. Brief dialogue is clean and goal-directed, serving concept and plot. At times the elevated register risks distancing us slightly from embodied immediacy, but it largely holds together as a coherent narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a recognizable lyric-science-fantasy diction (“wavelength align with purpose,” “cosmic chatter”). The prose maintains a consistent register and vantage without head-hopping or unexplained shifts in distance. While the voice fits the material, it feels more like a generalized elevated SF-narrative idiom than something uniquely Elara’s; her individual perceptual biases could be sharper. Still, rhythm and stance are controlled, and the narrative handles its abstractions without losing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical, consistent, and suits the mythic register of reapers and rifts. Diction like “distant intimacy” and “reluctant harvests” creates a distinct perceptual texture that feels character-bound rather than generic fantasy prose. Rhythm modulates decently with intensity, tightening as monsters emerge and softening at the close. At times the voice edges toward purple with stacked modifiers and repeated lexical motifs, which occasionally feel like style for its own sake rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice stays consistent and colored by Elowen’s perspective, with a lyrical, slightly archaic diction that suits the mythic tone. Narrative distance modulates appropriately—from broader cosmic description down into his sweating, shaking focus during the repair. At times, the voice over-relies on repeated epithets (“lukewarm mage,” “earnestly naive”) rather than fresher turns that would keep the rhythm from feeling patterned. Still, there’s a distinct perceptual signature in how physical minutiae (drips, pendulum swings) are noticed and elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice on Elias is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly elevated diction that fits the quasi-mythic mood of the setting. Recurrent phrases (“precisely humane,” “mirrored hush”) and the syntax of the narration establish a distinct texture that remains controlled and legible. Occasionally the narrative slips toward abstract, editorial phrasing (“His motivation burned steady: to spin stories into shared meaning,” “motivation fulfilled”) that feels more authorial than character-bound. Dialogue is sparse but functions cleanly as action, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lush, and clearly filtered through an alchemist who thinks in precise yet poetic terms; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction and syntax maintain a distinct, elevated texture that suits the mystical orchard and ritual frame. Rhythmic variation is decent, though the sustained high-register lyricism risks feeling uniform over the piece. A few abstract formulations (“ancient freshness,” “touch of wonder descended”) feel more authorial than character-specific, modestly diluting the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    The limited third-person voice is consistent, with a sensibility that blends technical focus and lyric perception, fitting a “pattern seeker” mind. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying urgency and trust without exposition dumps; Lena’s brief lines feel distinct enough and goal-driven. Rhythmic control is generally strong, especially in the central crisis where sentence structure tightens around action. The final run of clipped, aphoristic sentences risks feeling slightly programmatic rather than entirely organic to the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled elevated register that fits the cosmic-dojo premise (e.g., “temporal vortices,” “vivified unity”) and avoids jarring shifts. POV remains stable around Kai’s experience, with only occasional omniscient flourishes that don’t muddle focalization. Dialogue is sparse but functional, clearly signaling status dynamics (“You feel nothing” / “Precisely why I claim it”) and moving the conflict forward, though it edges expository at times. The prose texture is distinctive, if occasionally more declarative than felt in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly baroque texture that matches Elias’s reflective, puzzle-oriented mind. Diction like “orthogonal path,” “innovation’s brook,” and “evolution’s brutal poetry” establishes a coherent stylistic register. At times, the lyricism edges toward self-consciousness and abstraction, but it never fully breaks clarity. There’s no dialogue to test, yet the narrative stance itself is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and textured, with repeated phrases (“mournfully eager,” “off-key wind”) functioning as intentional motifs rather than tics. Syntax and rhythm support the accumulative design: long, flowing sentences match the swirling winds and endless echoes, while sharper clauses mark key turns (first blower roaring to life, blowers sputtering out). Diction is consistently elevated but suits the mythic-gothic frame of a ghostly conductor in an echo tunnel. At times the narration verges on uniformly lush, leaving less modulation between calm and peak beats than optimal, but control never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to a liminal, quasi-mystical being; diction like “stacked infinities” and “foggy lucidity” creates a strong perceptual signature. The lyric mode is taught from the opening and maintained without head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythms and syntax mostly support the atmosphere and remain legible even when abstract. There is some recurrence of favored constructions (“interiorizing,” “boundaries of light”) but it reads as intentional pattern rather than mechanical tic.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a lush, almost liturgical lexicon that fits both alchemy and ruined holiness. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with deliberate patterning around the approximations and key insights. The elevated diction sometimes pulls toward authorial rather than strictly character-bound voice, but it remains internally consistent and supports the mythic, ritual mood. No POV slippage or stance confusion undermines the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technical radio detail with lyrical cosmic imagery. The diction (“fantasy practicality,” “star-whispers,” “void-veins”) feels unified to this world and character rather than generic. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from droning, and there is no POV slippage. At times the voice risks purple flourish, but it doesn’t break distance or legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lush, slightly lyrical texture that fits Elias’s ardent, optimistic sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately with rising pressure (e.g., more staccato beats during radio-tuning and spectral overlap). Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct enough, especially in the brief exchange with the pessimistic parallel Elias. Occasionally the register edges into self-conscious abstraction (“permanent transient,” “wedding timelines”) that feels more authorial than character-bound, keeping this just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suits a fevered, hyper-perceptive architect; diction like “rational enchantments,” “realistically imaginary,” and “unsettling calm” coheres as a distinctive register. Rhythm and syntax have clear patterning that supports the lyric, accumulative mode, and the interior filter remains consistent with Elias’s abstract, design-minded perspective. Repetition of certain coined phrases skirts self-consciousness but reads more as intentional motif than artifact. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice holds under the climactic pressure of the eruption.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-matched to the speculative setting, with phrases like “crystalline minds awakening” and “somber marvel” establishing a distinct texture. POV is stable and legible, mostly tracking Kai while giving Elara’s stance through observable behavior and limited telling. Dialogue is clearly attributed and functional, though often expository rather than subtext-rich. The voice does risk mild sameness in its solemn register but remains controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close on Elara is stable and controlled, with a consistent, slightly lyrical narrative texture (“reeling hush,” “mist-clad atrium,” “echoes left behind”). Dialogue is functional, clear, and non-clumsy, though often serves as direct exposition of theme rather than subtext. The voice has a recognizable cadence and tonal coherence, particularly in its quiet, hushed register. Some phrasing becomes repetitively poetic, verging on purple, which flattens distinctiveness at key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent sensory and conceptual palette (hush, pulses, phase, cables) that feels tied to Elara’s perspective as a spelunker and tech-adjacent professional. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to sustain momentum, and the occasional heightened diction suits the quasi-lyric, SF-horror atmosphere. There is minimal dialogue and no head-hopping, so focalization remains clean. A few stock phrasings and repeated constructions keep the voice from reaching truly distinctive, signature territory.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and stays close to Elara’s sensibility. Recurrent phrases and images (snow, opal light, midnight solace, heartbeat counts) create a distinct texture and controlled rhythm. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the ghost’s clipped, glitchy utterances contrasting with her steadier tone. A few constructions feel slightly redundant or self-conscious, but overall POV control and modulation under pressure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistently lyrical, and tuned to Thorne’s sensibility, with textured diction that matches the piece’s preoccupation with sensory language. Repetition of phrases like “quietly articulate” and some patterned syntax read as intentional motif rather than artifact. Psychic distance stays stable; we inhabit a close but stylized lens without head-hopping or register breaks. The one line of direct thought (“The birds script the air…”) fits and slightly modulates rhythm without disrupting stance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and recognizably filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction around plants, cold, and cosmic play. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the more incantatory repetitions (“harmony untamed,” “gravitationally playful”) fit the mythic mode even if slightly overused. Dialogue is sparse but functional, though often on-the-nose in articulating the story’s thesis rather than embedding subtext. Overall, POV control is solid and confident, just shy of truly distinctive nuance under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, lyrical, and well-matched to the subject, with rhythmic sentences and recurring phrasal patterns that feel intentional rather than accidental. Diction is elevated but consistent with the fable-like, poetic register; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Repeated formulations (“resonantly soft,” “gap between knowing and understanding”) are noticeable but patterned rather than sloppy. While not formally dazzling enough for the highest band, the POV control and voice texture are clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly textured—lyric but controlled, with recurring turns of phrase (“respectfully rebellious,” “brittle hush”) that feel intentional rather than random. Free indirect access to Elias’s perceptions (slots as “unmet eyes,” ghosts in pinball) grounds the elevated diction in character rather than generic purple prose. Dialogue is sparse but functional and tonally apt, contrasting his mild politeness with his covert acts. There is occasional risk of over-embellishment, yet the rhythm generally supports mood and pressure rather than diluting it.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture—rhythmic, image-rich, and consistently tuned to Elias’s quiet, reverent perspective. Phrases like “whispering gleam” and “faded popcorn dreams” build a recognizable sonic palette, and the modulation from eerie discovery to charged restoration reads controlled. At times the register feels a bit homogenously poetic, blurring the difference between narrator and character sensibility, but it never slips into obvious head-hopping or flat generality. The voice is strong and publication-ready with only minor risk of overrichness.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lucid, lyrical register that matches the intellectual/mystical subject matter. Diction like “pseudosphere,” “horocycle,” and “hyperbolic tessellations” feels motivated by Eliza’s mind rather than imposed jargon. Rhythm leans toward long, similarly cadenced sentences, which creates a hypnotic effect but occasionally risks monotony and softens moments that might benefit from sharper, shorter beats. Still, the perceptual signature—scientific-poetic, mildly obsessive—is distinct and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-closish POV on Elara is stable and well controlled, with no head-hopping or stance drift. Voice has a distinct lyrical texture—“luminous absence,” “improbable beginnings,” “colors harvested from sunrises long past”—that feels consistent and character-appropriate for this mythic mode. Rhythm modulates reasonably with pressure, tightening during the multi-dawn sequence while keeping the same tonal palette. Occasionally the diction verges on uniformly elevated, but it reads as an intentional stylistic choice rather than register confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent in register and psychic distance, maintaining a clear external vantage with light interior access to both characters. Rhythms and diction establish a recognizable texture suited to mythic fantasy, and point of view remains stable without head-hopping artifacts. Yet the voice relies heavily on a narrow palette of repeated phrases (“cosmic hush,” “improbable longing,” “enveloped secrets”), which begins to feel templated rather than idiosyncratic. Greater modulation and specificity would be required for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with rich, controlled diction that matches an aging, bookish folklorist and leans into lyricism without losing clarity. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the descriptive texture feels unified rather than generic. There are no POV slips or inexplicable knowledge jumps; the narrative maintains a coherent distance. The elevated register is arguably a touch more ornate than Elias himself might think in extremis, but it reads as an intentionally literary filter rather than a drift.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice leans slightly toward Elara while still tracking external action cleanly, and the diction is consistent, with a mildly elevated, mythic-tinged register that matches the premise. Dialogue generally feels natural and goal-driven, especially Elara’s barbed but caring commands contrasted with Kai’s uncertainty. Narrative distance and tense remain stable, and there’s no head-hopping. At times the prose voice lapses into generalized lyric description that feels more authorial than character-filtered, softening the distinctness of Elara’s perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated and consistent, with recurring phrases (“radiant hush,” “essence”) creating a distinct sonic pattern. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable and clearly subordinate to the narrative texture. POV distance stays stable, with no intrusive head-hopping, and the narrator’s omniscient-lyric stance matches the fairy-tale register. At times, the diction edges toward homogenous solemnity, which flattens emotional modulation across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and attuned to Lirien’s craft and obsessions, with a controlled repetition of key phrases that builds texture rather than confusion. The fisherman's shade’s speech is spare but distinct in rhythm from the narration, and the diction of the piece maintains an elevated, incantatory register that suits the premise. POV boundaries are respected and there is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks immersion. The voice could feel even more singular if Lirien’s perceptual quirks under stress were sharpened beyond shared lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and suits a methodical, observant protagonist. Elias’s perceptual signature—attention to maps, contours, shadows, and archival detail—feels distinct and is maintained under pressure. There is some repetition of key descriptive phrases and conceptual labels, which slightly flattens rhythmic variety. Overall, POV control is firm and there is no head-hopping or unjustified register lurching.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct: lyrical, scientifically literate, and suffused with a quiet, analytic melancholy that clearly belongs to Elara. Diction (“Schrödinger’s wave of probability,” “sea’s vast superposition”) is elevated but plausibly aligned with a physicist-diver’s inner language. POV remains stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythms and cadences modulate successfully between dense description and more declarative lines at key beats, supporting the piece’s lyric-essay hybrid mode.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) that suits the fable-like mode. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly consistent; invented terms and metaphors feel of a piece with the world. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the ghost’s “voice” is handled cleverly through visual reformation rather than clunky dialogue. Repetition of certain coined phrases edges toward mannerism but doesn’t yet break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is mostly consistent, with a lyrical, slightly ornate texture that fits the fantastical setting and Lira’s temperament. The perceptual signature—curiosity, tenderness toward Elowen, attention to light—is clear. However, the meta-textual intrusions about word counts and trimming violently break POV and register, reading as an external drafting note rather than anything Lira could think or perceive. That seam undercuts confidence in the narrative stance and prevents the voice from feeling fully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends professional meteorological lexicon with intimate, grief-driven metaphor. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative distance remains stable. A few recurring diction choices (“quietly explosive,” “dusty starlight dusted”) flirt with self-conscious patterning, and the register occasionally leans into elevated abstraction that slightly outstrips plausible in-the-moment cognition. Overall, though, the voice feels unified and confident, enhancing rather than obscuring the piece’s emotional and conceptual aims.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, slightly heightened lyricism that suits Elara’s pattern-driven perception. Diction like “fractually precise strokes” and “hush’s rupture” fits a contemplative, literary tone and rarely feels out of register for the piece’s stance. Occasional authorial generalizations about the guild (“their scholarly minds too rigid for fractal chaos”) tip toward omniscient commentary but do not disrupt coherence or focalization. Overall, the perceptual signature—attention to pattern, light, and gesture over faces—remains stable and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a clear, slightly ornate narrative texture that matches Elara’s imaginative, self-narrating nature. Her habit of speaking to herself is handled consistently and reinforces both character and tone. Occasionally the diction pushes toward repetition (“diligently curious,” “sociably”) and decorative flourish, but it remains controlled and legible. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion; the narrative distance feels well managed for this kind of whimsical fantasy vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward mechanical and celestial imagery that fits Elias’s vocation. Syntax and diction are controlled, and the elevated register feels intentional rather than random, suiting the mythic-fantastical frame. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. At times the narration sounds more like an external poetic intelligence than Elias’s own inner rhythm, but it remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person narration has a consistent, mildly lyrical texture with some memorable turns (“voice like gravel,” “brambled hope stirred”). POV stance is stable, if somewhat distant, and doesn’t slip confusingly between heads despite covering multiple characters. At times the register feels a bit generalized or summary-like, keeping us outside the characters at moments that could bear more intimate access. Overall, it’s controlled and readable, but not yet singular or sharply character-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a timeless, quasi-mythic subject; diction like “pane of hush” and “time’s final ripple” feels coherent rather than arbitrary. The prose rhythm modulates between slow, contemplative build and a slightly quickened pulse during the singing and Doomsday Clock movement. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty stays anchored to what Elias can plausibly perceive or infer. At times the elevated register risks slight sameness of tone, but it remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, marrying gritty physicality with a lyrical, slightly sardonic texture that fits Elias. Phrasings like “gracelessly, like the birds’ gears” and “winds howled like thwarted lovers” show controlled rhythm and patterning, even if a touch writerly for his psyche at times. Psychic distance stays stable; we are inside his perceptions without head-hopping or stance confusion. The brief snippets of dialogue are minimal but sound natural and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture, blending musical and chemical lexicons in a way that feels particular to Elias (e.g., “symphonically minded approach to molecular bonds,” “dissonant chord in his soul’s symphony”). The perceptual filter is stable and mostly plausible for a poetic-minded scientist. Occasionally, the register slides into abstract or corporate phrasing (“eco-healing materials,” “formulations for foam-derived emulsifiers”) that jars slightly against the otherwise sensuous, metaphor-driven narration. Overall, the voice is strong and coherent but not yet seamlessly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s conceptual, numerical way of seeing the world. Repetition of phrases like “mindfully scattered” and the technical, quasi-mystical register around “glimmering parole” feel patterned rather than accidental. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience beyond the slight mythic zoom-out, which matches the established narrative stance. Rhythm and syntax mostly serve the accumulative mode, though they occasionally verge on uniform in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in taste, texture, and craft; phrases like “remorse stored deep like salt in cured meat” feel character-specific. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled and lyrical without losing clarity, and psychic distance stays consistent. A few repeated metaphoric binaries (“sturdy / brittle”) are slightly on-the-nose but coherent with the story’s tonal aims. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative confidently inhabits Elaris’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear penchant for lush, musical phrasing that fits a choral librarian protagonist. Multilingual moments (“¡Uníos, unite, єднайтеся!”) are well handled and rhythmically integrated, and the third-person focalization stays tightly on Elara. At times the diction veers into slogan-like repetition (“vigorous tender,” “borrowed starlight hush”), but it remains legible and purposeful rather than confused. Overall, the narrative stance feels distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive—dense with helix, entropy, and neuro-technical diction that clearly belongs to Elara’s mind. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with long, incantatory lines that fit the reverie mode and stay consistent. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; interiority and description share a single, coherent texture. Repetition of key terms feels mostly like purposeful motif rather than scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinctively ornamental, with a clear perceptual signature built from refraction, spectra, and inversion metaphors. Diction is elevated but consistent with the fantastical register and Elara’s role as archivist; there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony and support the lyric-arcane mood. At times, repeated constructions (“clandestinely luminous,” “latent blaze,” “seeds of vigilance”) verge on self-conscious motif rather than organically modulated voice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its musical metaphors and attentiveness to vibration and motion rather than sound. POV distance is stable and appropriate, staying close enough to Elowen’s sensibility without slipping into authorial explanation. Rhythms modulate well between longer, flowing sentences for atmosphere and tighter ones at key actions (“Then, he began to strum…”). A few repeated formulations (“symphonically minded,” “empathy in motion”) flirt with self-consciousness but don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture that blends chess, magnetism, and quiet grief into a coherent perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with patterned phrases (“translating silence,” “thoughtfully precise”) reinforcing motif rather than reading as template. Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate; we never slip into knowledge Elias cannot have. Occasionally the narration edges toward overt essayistic statement, but it doesn’t break POV or undermine the otherwise strong voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and confidently patterned; “theatrical sincerity” is convincingly embodied in the narration and his spoken appeals to the diary. POV remains stable and the diction has a distinct texture that suits a quasi-mystical, philosophizing tinker. At times the narrative register feels more like an external literary consciousness than Elias’s inner language, creating slight distance. Still, the overall rhythmic and tonal control is strong and serves the material.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, sensuous texture, with strong olfactory focus that matches Elara’s sensitivity and profession. Diction and rhythm are consistent and controlled, leaning into lyricism without losing track of scene. The narrative distance remains stable, and there are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell. Occasionally the register edges toward ornate abstraction, but it mostly feels like a coherent, intentional stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and colored by Elara’s pilot/orchard-worker sensibility, with consistent attention to flight dynamics, orchards, and environmental cues. The lyric-technical mix (“core resonance,” “liquid starlight,” “hyper-vital moss”) feels cohesive for this SF-mythic register. Psychic distance remains well-controlled; we stay anchored in her perceptions without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. Occasionally the language edges toward generalized portent, but it doesn’t break the voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits a meticulous investigator. Phrases like “hazy precision” and “digital web mapping how air currents had surged” give the narration a recognizable texture without breaking POV plausibility. There is some repetition of constructions and key phrases that edges toward self-conscious patterning. Still, focalization and distance remain stable and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent high-register diction and strong sensory layering, particularly around synesthetic perceptions. Third-person close on Elyra is stable; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the prose maintains a recognizably singular texture. At times the language risks uniform elevation, but it fits the mythic, ceremonial frame rather than clashing with it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly elevated fantasy-lyric register that matches the premise and never breaks POV. Phrasing like “avalanchingly quiet” and “canyon hush” gives the prose texture without major register clashes. At times, diction trends toward generalized loftiness rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature for Elaron. Overall, control is solid and readable, if not yet distinctive enough for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—dense imagery, mathematical-astral diction—that feels unified with Elias’s mind. POV remains stable and primarily close-third on Elias, with Mira’s shifts indicated through action and dialogue rather than head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but effective, carrying subtext (his use of her own voice, her wild laughter when overtaken by his drive). At times the elevated register risks uniformity across speakers, but the overall control and consistency under pressure hold.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Kael notices auroras, relics, and routine fatigue. Lyric diction (“across the fade from memory to myth,” “ridgewinds whispered approvals”) feels intentional and mostly well controlled, aligning with the mythic tone rather than drifting into generic high lyric. Dialogue is brief but natural and character-appropriate, with Lira’s bluntness contrasting Kael’s tentative offers. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and rhythmic variation is good enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that suits a character who is both scientist and mystic, with patterned phrases (“firmly grounded,” “shifted hush”) functioning as intentional motifs. Diction and imagery—“crystalline pavilion,” “frozen prayers,” “captive feelings”—are consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility rather than feeling imposed from outside. Psychic distance and tense are stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. Occasionally the elevated register verges on uniform lushness, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is a consistent, high-lyric third-person with dense imagery (“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry,” “hardened tears of a colossal oak”) that suits the mythic, sacrificial tale. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with patterning of key phrases that supports the accumulative structure. At times, the register leans toward purple, but it remains legible and intentional rather than haphazard. POV is stable and modestly close to Elara without intrusive authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical, with a strong sensory palette and recurring diction that feels intentional rather than generic. Third-person focus stays tightly with Elar’s perceptions and priorities—craft, stone, sound—without head-hopping or register slips. Rhythms modulate between sweeping description and more clipped, process-oriented lines in the shaft, giving some dynamic range. At times the elevated, incantatory tone flattens emotional spikes (many clauses carry similar weight), but overall the voice is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture that fits Elara’s sensory and metaphysical orientation, with recurring attentiveness to texture, smell, and ambient sound. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, and the psychic distance stays stable; we don’t get unmotivated head-hopping or register lurches. Repetition of certain constructions (“cyclically spontaneous,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams”) verges on self-conscious patterning, but remains legible. Overall the voice feels particular and competent, if not yet singular enough for elite-tier distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is largely consistent—lyric, sensory, and close to Elias—with dialogue that feels apt for the setting and characters. The perceptual filter (reticent, observant skipper) is mostly stable. However, the mid-to-late intrusion of raw drafting commentary (“No—that exceeded; trim in mind…”) abruptly breaks POV, stance, and rhythm, reading as unintentional artifact. This rupture disqualifies the piece from higher-band voice scores despite its underlying strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctively baroque, with phrases like “star-fretted dome” and “veil’s frayed edge” giving a strong tonal signature. Diction is occasionally overwrought but remains coherent with the mythic-gothic register and Elias’s persona. POV is stable and free of head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge leaps. Rhythmic variation could be sharper—many sentences share similar lush, clause-heavy structures—but the voice feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a meticulous craftsman who thinks in terms of light, pigments, and subtle shifts. Diction and syntax have a distinct texture (“stories clung to her like dew on spider silk,” “sun trails—those golden arcs”) without drifting into registers that feel alien to the character. Psychic distance is stable, with interior commentary and external observation braided smoothly. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates gently with the rising intensity of the experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet grounded in Elias’s occupational lens—tools, corridors, and maintenance rhythms sit comfortably beside more numinous imagery. Syntax and rhythm are well modulated, with long, sinuous sentences matching the labyrinthine setting without collapsing into confusion. Diction is elevated but internally consistent; it never sounds like an expository essay or alien register. Overall, the POV control and narrative texture would be at home in serious literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably elevated for the material, with strong rhythmic control in many lines. Diction fits the mythic register and rarely clashes, and the narrative stance stays stable and close enough to Elara to feel anchored while still allowing grander commentary. There are some repetitive syntactic moves and a tendency toward high abstraction in places, but they don’t break POV or clarity. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and deliberate, if occasionally a bit uniform in its intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated but controlled diction that suits a literary, almost fable-like tone. Elara’s perception filters much of the language (attention to sorrow, quiet, and books), giving a mild but coherent perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse yet functional and in-character, though not especially textured. At times the narrative register leans toward abstract/philosophical phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound, but it doesn’t seriously disrupt POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with Elias’s way of noticing (erosion, small salvations) clearly shaping diction and imagery. Lyricism is controlled enough that the narrative remains legible; phrases like “creeping normality noticer” and “heuristically gentle” signal a slightly cerebral sensibility that fits him. Dialogue between Elias and Mira is spare, efficient, and subtext-rich, letting shared history and emotion sit in implication rather than exposition. At times the register edges toward self-conscious cleverness, which may feel a touch mannered for a top-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably lyrical, with a distinctive lexicon (“quartz hush,” “cloud-forged silver,” specific frequencies) that feels tailored to this world. Refrains like “gently meticulous” and “illusions faded to memory” create a deliberate incantatory rhythm rather than accidental redundancy. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion; the narration holds to Elias’s technical, reverent sensibility. The risk is a certain sameness of cadence across the piece, but clarity and tone never suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and well-suited to a liminal, noirish pirate underworld, with nice phrasings like “comforting shadows laced with threat.” Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-distinguishing; Thorne’s few lines land in character and move the scene. The repeated phrase “curiously steadfast” reads a bit like thematic labeling rather than organic voice, and some late-summary sentences feel more like editorial stance than Lila’s filtered perception. Overall, though, POV control and rhythmic variety are strong and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon that mixes tech and the numinous in a way that feels character-specific. Sentences like “nostalgia clung to every chrome spire and vine-wrapped tower” demonstrate a strong rhythmic and imagistic control. However, the meta-textual bracketed sentences about “final adjustment” and “word count calibrated” abruptly break immersion and undercut the narrative stance. Aside from those artifacts, POV and distance remain stable and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and colored by Elias’s artistic, observant mind. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a lyrical bent that suits the reflective, solitary scene. At times the register veers toward purple or repetitive (“auroral sorrow,” “uncorked creativity”), but clarity and focalization remain intact. There’s a distinct perceptual signature, even if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, sensuous, and clearly colored by Elara’s aesthetic sensibility; phrases like “her fingers tracing zinc ridges like Braille confessions” feel both world- and character-specific. POV control is solid—no head-hopping, and interior access is woven through action without explanatory overkill. Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural, especially in the child’s blunt “Papa, it’s only half,” which efficiently delivers both plot and theme. The register is occasionally a touch ornate, but it remains coherent with the chosen lyrical, high-concept mode.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, assured, and distinct, with patterned diction around resonance, color, and sound that suits the mythic mode and post-verbal premise. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is stably close-omniscient filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm is generally well-controlled, with long cadenced sentences that match the contemplative tone. Some high-register abstraction verges on uniformity, but it remains within a coherent stylistic choice rather than feeling like drift.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct: lyrical, slightly ceremonial, but filtered through an android’s programmed nostalgia in a consistent way. Diction and rhythm support the tone of “fragmented wholeness,” with recurring cadences (“Chaos contained—method perfected”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance stays mostly tight under pressure. Occasionally the register leans a bit generalized or slogan-like, which slightly flattens the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady and lyrical, with recurring images like “sandstorm calm” providing a distinct texture. POV is generally controlled, even as it occasionally glides into light omniscience about the group’s emotions without causing confusion. Dialogue, brief as it is, feels stylized but functional, carrying clues and a sense of ritual storytelling. At times the register veers toward generic uplift, but overall the voice is consistent and suited to the fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits Elara’s identity as a “lyrical code breaker.” Diction and rhythm are generally consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative comfortably handles conceptual moves like “poetic algorithm” and “dance as explanation” without losing clarity. At times the register edges toward uniformly elevated, but it still feels like an intentional stylistic choice rather than an accident.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without slipping into abstract vagueness, and maintains a distinct texture (maritime, ritualistic, faintly folkloric). Diction and rhythm are well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences matching the contemplative, uncanny mood. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts, and the occasional elevated phrasing still feels plausible for this slightly mythic narrative frame. Some cadences verge on uniformity, but not enough to blunt the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close-ish narration maintains a stable, lyrical voice with controlled repetition of key phrases (“tranquil blaze,” “whispered secrets,” “smoothed hush”), establishing a clear stylistic identity. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic tone, and focalization doesn’t leak beyond what Elias could plausibly perceive or intuit. At times the voice flattens character distinction—Elias and the narrator sound identical—and the relentless poetics risk monotony rather than modulation under stress. Still, the stance is coherent and the pattern is taught early and sustained through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person-limited voice centered on Elara is consistent and controlled, with a gently ornate, lyrical texture that suits the premise. Diction like “dust motes in sunlight” and “murmurs grew insistent” creates a distinct perceptual signature without major register slips, and POV modesty is maintained. Dialogue is clean and serviceable, with subtext in their evasions and evasive banter about “fancies,” though it sometimes edges toward statement rather than indirection. A few repeated formulations (“patiently nimble”) feel slightly writerly, but overall rhythm and distance control are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and a strong atmospheric signature. The piece teaches its lush, metaphor-heavy style early and sustains it through the climax without losing basic clarity. Rhythmic control is generally good, with variation in sentence length that supports mood shifts from stillness to ritual intensity. Occasional repetitiveness in phrasing and heightened register (e.g., repeated “tragically radiant,” dense metaphor stacks) keeps it short of truly exceptional control for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear preference for elevated diction and long, rhythmic sentences that suit this quasi-mythic confession. POV is steady third-person centered on Elias, with no leakage into other consciousnesses or unearned omniscience. The cadences modulate slightly as the ritual intensifies, and the repeated motifs (“calibrated treason,” “pearl twilight”) create a recognizable texture. At times the register flirts with purple, but it remains controlled and intentional rather than sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent in its elevated diction and image patterns, well-matched to a mythic/fantastical frame. Third-person close on Elyra is stable, and the limited dialogue is functional and tonally coherent. Recurrent phrasings (reed, hum, webs) feel like deliberate motif rather than clumsy repetition. There is mild risk of uniform lyricism flattening moment-to-moment modulation, but control and texture are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with recurring maritime and icy imagery giving it a distinct texture. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic/ritual frame, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotone despite a high metaphor load. The narrator does not overreach beyond what Elara could plausibly infer in this supernatural context, maintaining POV modesty. Some phrases (“borrowed starlight,” “weaving truth”) recur close to the line where they might feel mannered, but they still align with the story’s internal logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Kai’s contemplative, image-rich consciousness. Diction like “scintillatingly somber” and “demure audacity” fits the elevated, almost mythic register and doesn’t break POV plausibility. Rhythm varies and the narrative stance remains steady; there’s no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts. The main limiter is that the voice is very polished but a shade uniform emotionally—less modulation between calm, doubt, and insight keeps it from absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a confident blend of tactile detail and concise techno-explanation (“flawed diamond lattice,” “harmless harmonics”). Elias’s perceptual priorities—debunking myths, reading anomalies—shape the narration in a way that feels character-bound rather than generic omniscience. At times the register drifts toward expositional summary when describing Voss’s creditors and the scavengers’ rumors, softening the immediacy. Still, rhythm and diction are controlled, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and confidently lyrical, with a strong, recognizable texture (e.g., “lightning’s gritty whimsy”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly fitting for a visionary in a heightened SF-lyric register. At times the patterned phrasing (“gritty,” “whimsy,” “variant allegiance”) becomes self-conscious, but it’s still coherent rather than sloppy. POV remains cleanly anchored in Elias’s perspective without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident and cohesive, with a distinct lyric texture (“lonesome splendor,” “feral loft,” “positively wistful promise”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, suiting a slightly elevated, poetic sensibility that matches Elias’s vocation. Dialogue is brief but natural enough and clearly distinguished in function from the narrative voice. Psychic distance remains steady; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, and the lyric, sensuous register is consistent with Elias’s perception of sound and body; rhythmic variation generally matches rising pressure. Phrases like “logically emotional” and “fleshly ethereal” give the voice some distinctive texture, and the psychic distance stays reasonably tight. However, the heightened, almost erotic diction in several peak lines (“orgasmic clarity,” “fleshly click”) occasionally tips into self-conscious purple, which can distract from rather than deepen the moment. A few cleaner, sharper sentences at the climax would better showcase the strong underlying voice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, slightly archaic register that fits the mythic-revolutionary tone and Elara’s meticulous mindset. Diction choices (“softly purposeful,” “unyoke them softly purposeful”) create a recognizable texture without drifting into register incoherence. Limited dialogue is clean and economical; Kai’s single line crystallizes the story’s ethos without breaking voice. Some repeated phrases function as motif rather than artifact, though the pattern is close to saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and textured, blending professional observational language with lyric flourishes in a way that feels appropriate for an introspective, educated investigator. Phrases like “fortified vulnerability, armor and wound intertwined” carry a distinct rhythmic and conceptual stamp. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; access to Lila’s memory remains clearly mediated through Elara’s experience. The modulation under pressure is smooth, maintaining clarity even as the prose becomes more charged near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and generally well controlled, with a lyrical, quasi-liturgical narrative register that fits a chaplain’s interiority and the quasi-sacred space of the shop. There’s a distinct rhythmic texture—long, flowing sentences punctuated by shorter emphatic beats—that modulates reasonably with emotional intensity. Dialogue is slightly aphoristic but consistent with the tone and advances theme and plot without obvious exposition-dumps. At times, the narration drifts into an elevated, authorial abstraction that feels less like Elias’s own mind and more like imposed rhetoric, but not enough to collapse POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, playful, and confident, with a strong rhythmic and metaphorical texture that aligns with Elara’s irreverent worldview. The third-person close is stable, and the diction (“drunk philosopher,” “viral rust,” “evolution’s lazy sprawl”) builds a coherent tonal universe. There are moments where the density of coined phrases and parallel constructions risks feeling mannered or samey, but legibility is maintained. Overall, the voice is a major strength and feels publication-ready with modest trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person close voice has a recognizable texture—coolly observant with occasional lyric flourishes about absence and echoes. POV is stable and access to Elara’s perceptions is consistent. However, the bracketed self-corrections about word count and recounting (“[412—no, recount properly.]”) read as authorial scaffolding rather than intentional voice, breaking the illusion. At times the diction shifts toward commentary more than character-filtered narration, diluting distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with controlled, elevated diction that suits the mythic-fantasy frame. There’s a distinct texture—“shadow-laced,” “gnarled apple trees blooming under the ceaseless sweep of the beacon”—that marks this as a particular narrative stance rather than generic fantasy prose. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying status dynamics (the wraith’s contempt, the dryad’s rigidity). At times, the narrative voice drifts into declarative thematic framing that flattens subtext, but POV distance and access remain stable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and has a distinct texture, balancing lyricism (“windborne solace,” “silk tearing slowly”) with clear scene progression. Liora’s perceptual signature—fixating on sounds, endings, and talismanic objects—gives the narration character-specific bias, while Tomas’s plain, rasping lines contrast effectively. There is some elevated diction, but it feels in keeping with a literary, slightly dissociated mind rather than intrusive authorial commentary. POV remains steady and reliable, with no disruptive slips or explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and maintains a stable focalization through Elena, with occasional but controlled insight into Theo’s stance. Diction (“intersubjective understanding,” “destiny’s quiet ache”) sometimes drifts toward abstraction, yet the overall rhythm and imagery feel deliberate and cohesive. Theo’s dialogue reads more formal and aphoristic than natural but is tonally aligned with the piece’s fable-like mode. The voice is distinctive and confident, though a bit self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the fable-like mode, with phrases like “whisperfield calm” and “line walker” giving it a distinct texture. Distance control is consistent: we hover just outside the line walker, close enough to observe but not to dwell in his private thoughts. Dialogue is sparse but in-character—plain, declarative, and aligned with the “strangely honest” trait. At times the diction risks sameness through repeated constructions, yet it never breaks POV logic or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture (“earnest whimsy,” “dove gray whispering promises”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative stance feels consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. However, phrase repetition and a narrow emotional register create a slight sameness of tone across beats. The near-total absence of dialogue until the one quoted line limits opportunities for modulation and subtext in spoken voice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature that marries scholarly precision to wonder (“atomsplosion, psychodeliria,” “hemmorhage of heroes”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and relatively stable, with the prose tightening slightly under emotional pressure (during testimony) without losing coherence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays appropriate to a reflective, quiet scene. At times the register verges on ornate, but it still feels motivated by the world and character rather than generic “literary” overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive: lush, metaphor-heavy third-person close with a clear perceptual signature centered on entropy, tech-ruin, and tidal imagery. Diction choices like “magnetic whispers,” “prophecy-forged fingers,” and “tidal remnants of visions” feel of a piece and suited to this mythic-lyric mode. Psychic distance stays stable; we are close to Elias’s obsessions without head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. At times the density of metaphor slightly flattens modulation between calm and peak beats, but overall rhythm and image control remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and colored by Elias’s sensibility—technical yet reverent toward instruments and phenomena, with a lyrical tilt (“pixels of fire,” “vacuum’s lie”). Diction and rhythm show deliberate patterning, especially around repeated motifs like “luminous ache” and “ephemeral,” which suits the story’s ambitions. At times, the register tips toward over-poetic, with stacked metaphors and ornate phrases that risk calling attention to themselves rather than the moment. Still, POV control remains clear and stable, and the voice feels like a coherent aesthetic choice rather than generic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear preference for poetic compounds and rhythmic phrasing (“pulsing stillness,” “radiant haven,” “hymning the mundane”). POV is mostly steady through Elara’s lens with brief, controlled shifts into a more omniscient register, and dialogue, though sparse, reads natural enough for the heightened tone. The diction is elevated but coherent for this quasi-mystical hospice setting, and the narrative stance does not wander into explanatory scaffolding. The main limitation is that the lyrical register sometimes smooths over sharper, character-specific textures that might distinguish the voices more.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with controlled, elevated diction that suits a scholarly, arcane setting. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and the prose often carries both worldbuilding and mood in the same line (“no longer tethered to mundane laws, cutlery twisted time in kitchens worldwide”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; POV distance is stable. At times the register edges toward lushness that risks uniformity of tone, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly archaic sensibility that suits the fae folklore ambience and Elara’s reflective mindset. Recurrent phrases (“shrewdly innocent,” “yearned,” “innovation”) help pattern the piece but sometimes verge on feeling like prompt obligations rather than organic diction. There’s solid control of psychic distance, staying near her perceptions without head-hopping, and no dialogue issues. A bit more rhythmic variation and less reliance on high-concept abstractions in the narration would sharpen the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, mythic-lyric register that suits the fable-like premise. Diction and syntax show deliberate rhythmic control, and the star- and sea-inflected vocabulary feels coherent with Elara’s worldview. Recurrent phrases (“bloomed,” “zephyr,” “pearl of stillness,” “reflectively vibrant”) begin to read as prompt-driven rather than entirely organic, slightly flattening the distinctiveness of the voice. Still, POV control is solid and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is stable and textured, with a clear lyrical signature in its nature/tech metaphors and rhythmic sentences. Elara’s way of noticing (fractals as “neural networks long extinct,” pendant as “trapped sunlight”) feels character-coherent and not generic. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, carrying subtext about recognition and shared hurt without over-explaining. The main weakness is occasional diction and repetition (“protected vulnerability,” “honeyed hush”) that feel more like authorial motif than living thought, slightly blurring the boundary between character voice and crafted overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical register and no POV slippage or head-hopping. The diction and rhythm are deliberate, leaning into incantatory repetition that suits the mythic mood. That same density risks sameness—phrases like “against the current,” “swirling hush,” and “solemnized” recur enough to feel slightly templated rather than freshly modulated under rising pressure. Overall, the voice is distinctive and controlled, just shy of fully surprising line by line.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-but-lyric voice is consistent and distinctive, with playful yet controlled diction that matches Elowen’s whimsical nature. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, supporting the sense of ritual and wonder without obvious head-hopping or stance confusion. Even when the camera widens to the village, the narrative stance feels coherent and confident. The voice is compelling enough for publication, though its safety (little modulation under stress) tracks the low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature focused on pattern, light, and bodily endurance. Diction—“safekept starlight,” “ephemeral cartography,” “moving stillness”—is elevated but coherent with Lir’s alchemical sensibility. The narrative distance stays stable, never slipping into information he couldn’t plausibly perceive. While lush, the voice remains controlled enough that it doesn’t drift into self-conscious ornamentation or explanatory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s reflective mind, with technical detail (gears, angles, prisms) comfortably sharing space with metaphor. The diction and syntax establish a strong, almost incantatory rhythm suited to a contemplative, accumulative piece. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and focalization remains tight. Occasionally the register edges toward uniform grandiosity, flattening emotional nuance under a single elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and recognizably its own, with recurring phrases (“shingled hush,” “boundary-lessly”) building a patterned texture. POV distance stays stable and appropriate to a reverie-like, slightly elevated register. At times the diction approaches over-lush, but it remains legible and supports the dreamy trance state rather than fighting it. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative rhythm modulates reasonably with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (circus-inflected metaphors, attention to tools and light). Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to sustain the lyricism, and POV never wobbles. A few abstract formulations (“harvest lessons from loss,” “core concept that haunted her”) slightly thin the otherwise character-grounded diction, but overall control remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lush, metaphor-rich idiom that matches the surreal setting and Elias’s reflective state. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with patterned phrases (“chronologically confused,” “eroded hush,” “stories collected, ghost appeased”) that support the fractured-temporal mood. Dialogue, when it appears, is spare but functional and distinct between the older Elias and his youthful ghost. The voice occasionally risks purple, yet it maintains control and coherence under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a mildly elevated, technical-lyric register that suits an introspective engineer. The “maze of intentions” / “equations for hope” lexicon builds a recognizable perceptual signature without major register slips. There is some repetition of key phrases that flirts with monotony but doesn’t break the spell. Absence of dialogue keeps the voice unified but also limits opportunities to contrast internal and external modes.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct preference for hushed, crystalline imagery that matches Elias’s interiority and the sanctuary’s ethos. Syntax and rhythm are generally controlled and musical, and the diction is stable across the piece. However, recurrent phrases (“glacial hush,” “excruciatingly gentle,” “petrichor nostalgia”) verge on self-conscious patterning and slightly erode freshness at key beats. The voice is strong and recognizable but would benefit from more modulation and restraint to reach top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is a consistent, elevated close third with a clear lyric bent, and POV control is steady. Recurring formulations (“serene upheaval,” “by training instincts,” “hindsight clarity”) create a pattern but also feel like visible scaffolding rather than organic thought. Diction occasionally slips into abstracted, thesis-like phrasing that slightly distances us from immediate experience. Overall, it’s competent and sometimes elegant, but not yet at an unmistakably singular or risk-tightened level.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elias’s contemplative worldview, with marine and botanical metaphors harmonizing nicely. Kael’s dialogue and diction feel distinct from Elias’s register without breaking tone. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with sentence length modulating to suit descriptive and reflective moments. The only restraint on a higher score is a touch of uniform preciosity—almost every line reaches for beauty, leaving less room for sharper, plainer textures under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lyric third-person voice is assured and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—sensuous, image-rich, and slightly archaic in cadence. Diction and syntax fit a reflective, symbol-attuned traveler; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm modulates enough to avoid monotony, and focalization stays close enough to Elias’s emotional state to feel grounded. The elevated register pushes toward lushness but remains coherent with the story’s ambitions and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive, baroque lexicon that suits a prince trapped in a decayed, ornate world. “Hypothesizing” as a repeated mental action gives the voice a recognizable cognitive texture. However, diction can verge on self-similar—“quaking,” “reverie,” “bittersweet,” and elaborate metaphors recur enough to flatten modulation in high-pressure moments. Despite that, the POV remains stable and legible, with no intrusive authorial drift or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is mostly steady, lyrical, and attuned to Lira’s perceptions, with a consistent elevated register. Some phrasing feels generically poetic rather than uniquely her, but the overall texture is controlled. The presence of drafting notes (“Wait, over—trim. No, restart count properly in mind.”) abruptly breaks POV integrity and editorial polish, materially lowering the score.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a recognizably mythic-intoned diction (“bruised autumn sky,” “defiant hush,” “liquid songs”). POV stays cleanly with Elara’s perceptions, though some abstractions read more like authorial commentary than her lived texture. The voice is polished and confident but not yet distinctive enough in its idiosyncrasies to feel unmistakably singular at a top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confidently lyric, with a consistent third-person focalization through Elowen’s sensibility and a strong perceptual signature (petal-sighs, memory-waves, approximated infinities). Diction and rhythm are controlled and largely coherent with an otherworldly, reflective consciousness; the pattern of pings, petals, and gears is taught and sustained. There is some repetition of key phrases and constructions that risks a slight sameness of cadence. Nonetheless, POV control remains clean and the voice feels intentional rather than generic or committee-averaged.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a meditative, elegiac piece; phrases like “thundering calm” and “shattered memories” feel of a piece rather than pasted-on. POV control is clean—no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge—and the sentence rhythms modulate nicely between longer, incantatory lines and sharper beats at key turns. The repetition of a few coined phrases (“fiercely meditative,” “thundering calm”) functions as motif more than tic, though it edges toward overuse. Overall the voice is confident and distinct enough for literary publication, if not yet startlingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated, lyrical diction that matches Elias’s near-mystical relationship to time and guilt. Sentence rhythms are varied and generally well-controlled, and the perception filter (clockwork, tides, balance) feels specific to him. Occasionally, phrasing drifts toward generic portentousness (“searing reverie,” “ethically diligent heart”), which slightly blurs the otherwise distinct texture. POV control is clean and stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive diction pattern (“velveteen gloom,” “tenderly organized,” “blithe”) that matches the protagonist’s outlook. POV control is stable and free of leakage; narration doesn’t claim knowledge beyond Elias’s plausible inferences. At times the elevated register skirts purple, but it remains legible and thematically aligned. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a unified texture.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The elevated, metaphor-rich third-person voice is consistent in register and suits the quasi-mythic, conceptual focus of the piece. There is a discernible narrative personality in phrases like “cartography of ignorance” and “predictive elegance,” and no head-hopping. That said, the narration often drifts into a more omniscient, declarative stance (“No force could halt...,” “Prevail he did, forever”) that flattens immediacy and tension at peak moments. The voice is distinctive but sometimes prioritizes grand abstraction over lived, character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with consistent diction (“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous”) creating a recognizable signature. The narration maintains appropriate epistemic modesty, never slipping into knowledge Elara couldn’t plausibly infer. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the brief bit of “dialogue” (her lyrics and the faint response) fits the established style. Some ornate phrasing edges toward sameness, but distance and stance remain well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but mostly stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, grave register that suits Elias’s sensibility. Focalization is steady and there’s no head-hopping; his perceptions and metaphors feel anchored in his worldview as an artist of grief and illusion. However, the final meta-textual aside (“No, trim later—wait... [792—final tally...]”) is a clear POV break that reads as an editing artifact rather than intentional slippage. That intrusion undermines the otherwise carefully held narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—baroque, slightly sardonic, and well-matched to a sewer-dwelling philosopher (“voice echoing like gravel in a sieve,” “survivor of salt and pressure”). Diction and rhythm are consistent, with a confident narrative stance that feels like Elias’s mind refracted through elevated prose. There are no POV slips or gratuitous explanations; reflection is anchored in concrete cues. At peak beats the voice remains controlled, though a few stacked metaphors flirt with excess without fully losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct texture (“traveled stillness,” “mandala of silenced storms”) that suits the meditative frame. Limited dialogue is functional and in-character, and there is no POV slippage. At times the register veers toward uniformly elevated phrasing, which smooths out individual character idiom and can feel slightly over-curated. Still, the narrative stance is controlled and recognizable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, mostly close third with a strong flavor of Elias’s idiom (“Life’s like a bad stew—stir it gentle, or it'll curdle”) and a consistent lyric-tinged register. Culinary metaphors and sensory focus give the piece a distinct perceptual signature. Occasional expository/technical phrases (“synaptic plasticity,” “sterile food labs erasing flavors to dull rebellion”) drift slightly out of his informal register, reading more like authorial explanation. Despite that, POV control is stable and rhythmically varied enough to feel polished.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice with light omniscient drift is controlled and consistent, leaning into a lush but not opaque lyricism (“electric honey,” “captured night”). Dialogue sounds natural and goal-driven; Elias and Mira have distinct idioms that reflect their roles and temperaments. The narrative diction is slightly elevated but feels coherent with the fable-like, techno-mythic tone. There are no jarring POV slips or register breaks that undercut intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (streetlights “daydream,” houses “breathe,” silence takes on substance). Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, supporting the meditative, slightly enchanted atmosphere. The distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the elevated register risks uniformity—almost too polished and dreamy—but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent lexicon and rhythm well-suited to a mythic underwater fantasy. Free-indirect access to Elara’s perceptions blends smoothly with Thalor’s telepathic speech, and the nonstandard dialogue channel (thought projection) is handled cleanly. Some phrasing is intentionally elevated (“voice a gentle scalpel,” “conceptual repricing” equivalents) without breaking the established register, though density occasionally risks over-richness. Under pressure, the voice maintains coherence and does not collapse into generic or expository prose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical-scientific register that fits a character obsessed with proofs in a metaphysical trap. Recurring syntactic rhythms and images (“integrals looping infinitely, derivatives chasing their own tails”) give the piece a distinct texture without becoming incoherent. There is some repetition of key terms (“texture,” “boundless confinement”) and a slight tendency toward abstraction, but it largely supports the tone. POV remains stable and modest in what it claims to know.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture (“saffron quiet,” “methodically hopeful,” “smog-choked city”) and stays stable throughout. Diction and rhythm suit both character and mode, with controlled cadences that swell for visionary passages and soften at closure. There’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition; even the brief dips into others’ memories read as a deliberate, omniscient-lyric widening rather than head-hopping. A few lines come close to portentousness, but the overall control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lush texture—“rosewater dread,” “voices defied tyrants,” “arts bundled like babes”—that suits the mythic, subterranean setting. POV is stable through Elara, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps. Rhythm and diction mostly stay controlled, though they occasionally flirt with over-elevated or densely figurative phrasing. The small amount of dialogue is apt and in keeping with the narrative register, though it’s sparse and largely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly patterned, with a consistent fascination with reversals and mechanical/temporal imagery that matches Elias’s mind and the premise. Diction (“counter-clockwise precision,” “time stuttering,” “latent radiance exploding”) is coherent across the piece and modulates effectively toward the climax without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping, and the mildly elevated, mythic register fits the fable-like scope. A touch more variation in rhythm and less reliance on repeated set phrases would push it closer to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is a confident, gothic-lyric close third, with consistent elevated diction (“silken rasp,” “lingering luminance”) that suits the baroque horror tone. Psychic distance is steady; we stay in Elara’s perceptions even as the narration uses stylized metaphor. Occasionally the register feels more ornate than a panicked girl might muster in the moment, signaling an authorial overlay rather than pure interiority. Still, the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled, with no POV slippage or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyric voice is consistent and distinct, with strong rhythmic control and a clear perceptual signature centered on sound and pattern. Diction such as “fractal generating,” “sketched resonance,” and “dubbing” is repeated enough to feel like a system rather than random ornament. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative stance stays tightly aligned with Elowen’s sensibility. At times the density of coined or abstract phrases edges toward mannered, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a confident, slightly ornate diction that matches the mythic-fantastical setting and Elara’s contemplative profession. Sentences carry a distinct rhythm, often pairing physical detail with conceptual weight (“patterns spoke of cycles: tides that birthed cities, watchers who judged wanderers”), and the focalization doesn’t leak into other interiorities. The voice modulates appropriately as pressure rises, maintaining clarity even when imagery thickens. A slight tendency toward repeated constructions (“sunwashed dread,” similar rhythm in several lines) and occasional purple edges keeps it from feeling completely effortless at the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a measured, reflective tone appropriate to a historian protagonist. Diction and syntax are controlled, and certain images (“emotional fire fueling rational blade”) have a memorable texture. At times, the narration drifts into expository or academic register, especially in generalized commentary about postwar narratives and “modern misinformation,” which weakens immediacy. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a recognizable lyrical texture and no POV slippage. Diction and rhythm are deliberate and mostly effective at sustaining a quiet, intense mood. There is some tension between the elevated, metaphor-rich narration and Elias’s grounded, technical profession—the voice sometimes feels more like an external poet than his embedded perception. Still, the stance is coherent enough that the piece reads as an intentional lyric mode rather than an accident of register.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, elevated diction that generally suits the fantastical setting and Elara’s methodical temperament. Phrases like “dappled resolve” and “tranquilly perceptive” build a recognizable texture, and the narrative stance remains stably within her perception and knowledge. At times the register tips toward ornate abstraction, but not so far as to obscure events or contradict POV plausibility. Rhythmic variation and controlled repetition keep the prose from feeling mechanically patterned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistently filtered through Elar’s sensibility, full of craft and light metaphors that match his occupation and state of mind. Rhythm and diction feel deliberate, with a lyrical but controlled cadence and no POV slippage or head-hopping. Even without dialogue, the voice carries urgency and emotional specificity. The uniform high-register lyricism risks slight sameness of texture but remains coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a textured, slightly baroque lexicon that matches a highly technical, damaged obsessive. Phrasing like “intangibly tangible, solid to the eye yet phasing through barriers like a quantum specter” shows a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable, flexing a bit closer at emotional peaks. Occasionally the abstract register (“vacuum energy resonances,” “conceptual pools of unused potential”) risks feeling more essayistic than fully embodied, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility for this character.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and fits the quasi-mythic SF tone, with neat phrases like “brilliant dimness” and “cosmic whispers for scholars who never came.” POV distance is consistent, leaning slightly closer to Elara while keeping the pilgrim more observed. Dialogue is functional and not overused, though sometimes serves as direct thematic statement more than subtext. Rhythmic and lexical choices feel intentional, if occasionally repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and recognizably Elias’s, with a strong preference for sea and craft imagery. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between sensory perception and reflection without head-hopping. Some diction clusters (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret,” “quelled”) are repeated enough to feel like visible craft moves rather than organic thought, which slightly undercuts naturalness. Overall, the voice is controlled and distinctive, if occasionally mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and generally well-controlled, with a consistent elevated, lyrical register that suits the solemn scene. Elara’s perception shapes much of the language, and Kael’s brief dialogue signals a compatible but distinct restraint. Some phrasing edges toward generic-poetic or repetitive (“furrowed hush,” “uncommonly thoughtful,” several near-synonymous abstractions), softening the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Dialogue advances the negotiation but can feel formal and declarative, with limited subtextual sparring.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinctive, with a salty, ruminative rhythm that suits an aging navigator half in love with his own ruin. Phrasal repetitions ("merrily melancholic," "flickering faith," "backlash") largely read as deliberate motif rather than accident. Syntax varies enough to keep the lyricism moving, and POV access never wobbles. At times the register drifts toward grandiose abstraction ("redemption's distant lighthouse," "salt-soaked grace") that feels a hair more literary than this specific man's lived thought, but not fatally so.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable and confident, with a clear tonal signature of weary lyricism (“clean slate smeared with the ghosts of a dirty past,” “jaded wonder”). Diction and cadence generally match the noir-tinged, speculative mood and Jax’s sensibility. A few phrases repeat or feel slightly self-conscious (“delicately robust,” “jaded wonder” re-used as a tag) but they don’t break immersion. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, and the narrative distance stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, with consistent diction (“cosmic intimacy,” “eternal moonlight”) and an apt distance for fairy-tale mode. Rhythm and syntax show some variety, and the piece teaches its lush, incantatory style early. That said, repeated phrases (“paradoxically steady,” “cosmic intimacy”) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers edge into sameness, slightly dulling impact. No head-hopping or stance confusion occurs, and the focalization remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive, lush texture that matches Lirien’s sensibility and the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm and purposeful sentence variation. Lexicon and syntax remain consistent and confident, and the brief quoted dialogue and remembered maternal voice slot naturally into the narrative stance. The voice compresses and sharpens at key moments (the discovery of the mechanism, the binding to the child) without losing coherence. The heightened diction is a stylistic choice that mostly serves mood rather than feeling imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elara’s quasi-mystical, non-human consciousness, with consistent diction (“ghostly resolve,” “recycled steel tomb,” “pacifist alchemy”). Psychic distance stays stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narration’s certainties match what this AI guardian could plausibly perceive. At times the elevated register and repeated conceptual terms create a mild sameness of rhythm and tone, but not enough to obscure events. Overall the voice feels confident and coherent, if slightly over-saturated.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent elevated register and a clear perceptual signature that leans into sensory richness and mythic cadence. Third-person focalization around Elias is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythms modulate reasonably with intensity, and the style supports the fable-like tone. At times, diction stacks abstractions (“texture of transformation,” “celestial ballet,” “vibrant hush”) that risk slight sameness, but they don’t break control.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a recognizable lyrical texture and consistent distance. Phrases like “winking hush,” “twilight’s sly grin,” and “thief in velvet gloves” show a deliberate stylistic palette. At times the diction and metaphor density verge on purple and repetitive, softening impact and making sections feel more like motif recitation than lived perception. Still, POV boundaries are clean, and the narrative stance holds together to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinctive texture built from repeated motifs (“borrowed dawn,” sliding, patterns). Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, and the narrative distance stays stable; we’re clearly in a mythic, heightened mode that suits the material. There’s no dialogue to test range, but the interior-tinted narration carries emotional and conceptual weight effectively. At times the elevated register risks homogeneity, yet it remains coherent for Kael’s visionary, ritual-focused perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric POV is stable and confident, with a consistent diction pattern (“storm-kissed,” “cartography of scars,” “furiously tranquil”) that feels like a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the prose from droning, and interior access is clear without head-hopping or stance wobble. The high-register, metaphor-dense voice is ambitious but mostly under control and aligned with Elias as a poet. A few phrases verge on self-conscious “lyricism” rather than necessity, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent slightly-elevated register that suits baroque dueling philosophers. Dialogue is stylized but coherent with the world and clearly goal-driven—barbed, philosophical, and status-conscious. Repetitions like “dignified chaos” and “diplomatically fierce” verge on mannerism, slightly flattening texture. Still, focalization is clean, there’s no head-hopping, and the rhythmic modulation between description and combat is mostly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm that feels tuned to Elias’s sensibility rather than generic high style. POV control is clean and stable, with no head-hopping and a coherent narrative distance that can glide from close perception to broader phrasing without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but natural within the heightened register and serves character and stakes rather than exposition. Occasional overload of coined phrases (“luminous fracture,” “blooming resistance”) nudges toward self-consciousness, but overall the voice feels intentional and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture and a clear alignment to Elias’s sensibility as a musician and observer of patterns. Diction is generally controlled and imagistic, and the fantastical register remains consistent throughout. At times, the narration leans into generalized emotional labels (“wistful,” “steely longing”) rather than letting subtext carry more of the weight, slightly flattening the voice’s individuality. Still, rhythm and perspective remain coherent under pressure, with no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinct texture—lyrical yet conceptually precise, matching a character who fuses magic and measurement. Phrases like “empirically whimsical flora” and “incantations laced with empirical rigor” create a clear perceptual signature. Rhythm varies, and the narrative distance stays controlled; there is no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge beyond Elara’s scope. On occasion the diction leans toward abstract repetition of its invented terms, but this reads as intentional patterning rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, Elara-centered POV is stable, and the lyrical register is consistent and intentional, with a recognizable pattern of sea/tide/cerulean diction. Hiroshi’s speech is formal and measured enough to distinguish him, even if it sometimes leans into aphorism. The main weakness is a tendency toward repetitive phrasing and elevated metaphor in narration and dialogue alike, which can make the voice feel slightly homogenized and self-conscious. Nonetheless, the voice is controlled and suits the mythic, meditative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice attempts a poetic register but is repeatedly disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The awkward phrasing ("Reflections sharpened, preprocesses reality by...") breaks the POV's internal rhythm. The tone shifts from scientific observation to fable-like whimsy without earning the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stiffened by the forced insertion of specific phrasing ("drifting resonance," "scorched testament"). While the tone aims for the poetic, these mechanical insertions disrupt the natural flow of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "Hush" premise, though it often relies on abstract summaries of emotion ("conveying depths words could no longer touch"). The tone is cohesive but lacks distinct rhythmic variation during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("swelled with eternal silence," "hesitant heartbeats"). Heavy adjectival layering distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice adopts a distant, myth-making tone that prevents immersion in any single moment. Point of view drifts between Mira, generic community perspectives, and historical summary. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on repetitive, prompt-derived phrasing to stitch the narrative together.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is heavily stylized and repetitive, relying on "purple" descriptors and abstract spiritual jargon. The intrusion of trait labels into dialogue tags ("whispered, spiritually curious as ever") breaks immersion and distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by unnatural diction choices ("retrocognized pains") and an over-reliance on an elevated, "purple" register that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.3)
    The voice is damaged by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("staggering grace," "patiently strategic"), creating a robotic and artificial cadence. These insertions disrupt the narrative flow and prevent a distinct, organic POV from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident and distinct, seamlessly blending technical expertise with lyrical, synesthetic perception. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly in Elias's sensory experience ("violet’s faint keen"). The prose style supports the atmospheric tone without sacrificing clarity or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice struggles to integrate the required phrases naturally, resulting in clunky appositives ("Elara, quietly savvy...") and awkward syntax. The tone aims for lyrical but often lands on purple due to the forced insertion of prompt terminology.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is choked with purple prose ("ballet of purpose," "tyranny") that distances the reader. The repetition of the specific phrase "thoughtfully spirited" as a tag feels mechanical and breaks immersion. The archaic, declamatory dialogue style ("Behold!", "Lo") clashes with the gritty setting.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=1.0)
    The voice is that of an outlining author rather than a narrative focalizer, explicitly breaking the fourth wall with editing instructions ("wait, cap"). This failure of distance control destroys narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the robotic insertion of required phrases ("ambered hush" x4, "flaking gold leaf booklet" x3), which creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm. The tone struggles to maintain immersion amidst these forced repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    Voice consistency is undermined by the mechanical repetition of required phrases ("remarkably composed," "mundane mysticism") which break immersion. The narrative distance is too explanatory, filtering the experience through summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice aims for a high-literary tone but lands on sentimentality and over-explanation ("forcing her to admit the betrayal was her own projection"). The narrative distance wavers, hopping into Mira's internal realization ("dawning realization") explicitly despite being centered on Elias. The tone is consistent but cloying.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mythic voice is generally consistent but stumbles into heavy exposition in the final dialogue ("For generations, we deceived ourselves..."), which breaks naturalism. The tone balances the sci-fi and fable elements well, though the register occasionally drifts into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, vacillating between flowery sci-fi description and jarring, bracketed editing commands. The intrusion of "Word count finalized" and "Wait, no meta" shatters the POV and voice control, reading as error or loss of authorial confidence rather than intentional experimentalism. The tone struggles to balance the "mechanically warm" oxymoron with the clinical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on breathless melodrama ("hush of unstruck chords," "communion") and repeats required phrases ("wordless conversation," "lately inspired") to the point of distraction. This repetition flattens the prose texture, making the voice feel constructed around keywords rather than character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical terms with high-fantasy lyricism. However, the narrative distance feels somewhat remote due to the density of abstract descriptors ("sorrow's auroral shimmer"), creating a slight barrier to visceral intimacy with the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("slicing through," "predatory sharpness"). The voice control slips with the forced repetition of the "drowsy alertness" tag, which reads more like a prompt insertion than an organic character state.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice aims for a mythic tone but slips into overwrought grandeur ("fingers steady as forgotten rivers") and abstraction. The POV is consistent, but the heavy filtering through poetic interpretation creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is melodramatic and overwritten ("voice like whispering wind"), lacking distinct texture or control. It prioritizes flowery sentiment over precise observation, resulting in a generic "literary" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone suitable for the genre. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("weeping ink," "fevered life") and relies on "as-you-know" phrasing to integrate the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from melodramatic phrasing ("soul's rusty lock") that creates distance. The tone drifts into breathless pulp registers ("gasping as microdots unfurled") that clash with the literary aspiration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and prone to breaking immersion by explicitly naming literary devices ("a chiasmus forming," "invoked his method: through rhetorical devices"). This creates a lecture-like distance rather than an immersive POV.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    Voice distinctiveness is undermined by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "upturned hush" (five times) and the trait "chronologically homesick" (four times). This mechanical looping flattens the narrative texture and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic, high-fantasy registers ("defiant flick," "radiant promise"). The distance is somewhat remote, observing Elias's metaphysical journey without accessing his grounded, immediate experience. The tone struggles to balance the "ancient" and "procedural" elements, resulting in a disjointed stylistic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its poetic tone but is hampered by mechanical, repetitive phrasing that feels like a checklist response. The lack of distinct voice modulation during the "enthralling" moments flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct but slips into "telling" cognitive processes ("Elara didn't intuit directly; she progressed laterally") instead of dramatizing them. The insertion of prompt phrases like "credibly curious nature" disrupts natural phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice vacillates between florid poeticism ("ethereal filigree") and clinical sterility ("terpenes mimicked neurotransmitters"). This register mismatch disrupts immersion, and the melodramatic tone often feels like a parody of emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice aims for a high-literary register but is frequently disrupted by the mechanical insertion of required phrases, which creates a disjointed, checklist-like rhythm. The prose often slips into purple territory ("velvet murmur," "fractured skies") that feels performative rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the material. However, the distance remains somewhat static, keeping the reader observing the ritual rather than inhabiting the visceral experience of the sound.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric but suffers from a lack of lexical variety, creating a robotic rhythm. The overuse of specific prompt terms ("affectionate," "thorough," "subsume") flattens the distinctiveness of the POV. While the "alchemical" tone is appropriate, the repetitive phrasing distracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is stiff and marred by the forced insertion of specific phrases ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive") that disrupt the rhythm. Dialogue feels like written exposition ("not by mistaken envelope, but choice") rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dialogue is stilted and performs exposition rather than resembling natural speech ("I seek the artist's mark," "It haunts me too"). The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, relying on "telling" the reader how characters feel via elevated abstraction. The POV filters everything through a lens of unearned reverence, flattening the distinctness of the supporting cast.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent tone that suits the high-fantasy content. The perspective is controlled, though the descriptions occasionally lean on standard genre tropes rather than a strictly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for high fantasy, maintaining a formal and elevated tone. However, it occasionally drifts into "purple" descriptions ("facets catching moonlight like captured tears") that prioritize ornamentation over immediacy. The integration of prompt phrases ("gently inventive hands") feels slightly awkward and disruptive to the natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from over-writing ("petrified rivers," "genealogies of the gone") that distances the reader. The repetition of the tag "kindly methodical" becomes a distracting artifact rather than a character reinforcer.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.8)
    Voice is disrupted by the clumsy insertion of required phrases, particularly the ungrammatical usage of "circuitously sincere" as a dialogue modifier. These insertions break the narrative flow and create a sense of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but marred by a heavy reliance on repetitive descriptors and adverbs that flatten the tone. The narrative distance is appropriate, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often defaulting to "adjective-noun" pairings that feel formulaic. The dialogue is expository and lacks distinct idiom between the two characters.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is functional but distant, with occasional unmotivated head-hopping between Thorne and Elara. The tone leans into melodramatic register ("Agony and ecstasy merged") without establishing the intimacy needed to support it.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, toggling between poetic description and the clunky, outline-like structure of the "intervals" sequence. The mechanical insertion of prompt phrases like "visionary resolve reactive to their hollow eyes" disrupts the rhythm and feels distinct from the established POV.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on purple prose and melodramatic phrasing ("shattered like pavement," "birthing new starts"). The POV stays with Elias, but the psychic distance is often too great to feel his specific human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of specific phrases ("courageously kind," "unheard symphony") which flattens the narrative distinctiveness. The tone is consistently elevated and sentimental ("canopy of indifferent stars"), lacking the modulation needed for tension. This heavy repetition draws attention to the writing itself, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistently melodramatic and relies on heavy filtering ("He was dimensionally aware," "He perceived," "He felt") that distances the reader. The register is monotonous in its elevation, lacking the modulation needed to make the climax feel distinct from the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending clinical observation with a mythic tone that suits the "deathly vitality" concept. The control of distance is solid, staying close to Eli’s perception throughout the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly perfumed, often prioritizing poetic sound over clarity. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("gilded-leaf," "incandescent hues," "restrained glows") creates a dense texture that sometimes distances the reader from the character’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated mythic tone that suits the setting. However, the narrative distance is often too great, filtering immediate experience through abstract summaries of perception ("filtered reality differently") rather than immersing the reader in the sensory moment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "gloomy" tone, but maintains a high psychic distance that filters the experience. The use of "voices" for the ghosts works within the established style, though the dialogue leans into aphorism. The writing is confident but occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is remote, summarizing large swathes of action ("Word spread like fireworks") instead of staying in the immediate scene. The voice leans toward purple prose ("kaleidoscope of costumes") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("clawed at the crater's rim like forgotten dreams") that slows momentum. The repetition of specific phrases breaks immersion, making the voice feel algorithmic rather than human.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, frequently distancing the reader from the character's immediate experience with flowery phrasing. The point of view filters the protagonist's experience through a "helpful narrator" who explains the significance of every action rather than letting it unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice aims for a literary tone but veers into purple prose ("dawn bled pink," "silence had a map") and stagey soliloquies. The narrative distance is consistent, but the reliance on filter verbs and labeled emotions ("wit surfacing") distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is marred by excessive repetition of specific phrases ("wild hush," "cryptic") which act as crutches rather than organic description. The register is consistently overwrought and melodramatic, creating a distance that prevents emotional engagement. The POV offers no unique perceptual signature, merely reporting the success of the magic ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a melodramatic, high-fantasy register ("eternal quietude," "desperate plea") that creates distance. The tone feels performed rather than intimate to the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic, high-gothic tone but is undermined by a lack of lexical variety. The prose texture is consistent but monotonous, relying on the same small set of words to evoke mood rather than modulating the voice to fit the shifting tension of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a mythic tone but is frequently disrupted by the awkward, repetitive insertion of required phrases (e.g., "through ephemeral cameo appearances"). This mechanical integration breaks the immersive spell and creates a stilted rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and mythic, keeping the reader at arm's length. The omniscience regarding the villagers and the "sleepwalking paths" feels convenient, and the tone lacks the intimacy required to make the emotional stakes felt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.5)
    Voice is severely damaged by the robotic repetition of specific phrases ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") inserted verbatim multiple times. This mechanical tagging overrides any distinct character voice, creating an artificial, prompt-driven cadence that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and establishes a distinct, if somewhat melodramatic, register suitable for the genre. However, it suffers from heavy filtering ("Elara felt," "She paused") and a tendency to summarize interiority in abstract terms rather than engaging with immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by excessive filtering ("she deduced," "she listened") which distances the reader. The dialogue leans into caricature ("Silly stars!", "Oh dear"), which, while intended as a disguise, flattens the character's voice into a trope without sufficient contrasting interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple prose," relying heavily on adjectival stacking ("ethereal hymns," "cryptic medium," "green gloom") that distances the reader. The tone aims for poetic myth but veers into melodrama, lacking the restraint needed for a publishable literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "purple prose" affectation ("lotus-hearted threnody," "quiet alchemy") that draws attention to the writing rather than the character's experience. The repetition of the specific phrase "shrewdly innocent" within a short space indicates a lack of control over narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.9)
    Voice is flattened by the mechanical, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("within the fold of a daydream," "pensive mirth"), which creates a checklist cadence. This forced inclusion disrupts the narrative flow and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.8)
    The POV shifts from Elias to deep access of Lena’s internal memories ("memories of her childhood... resurfaced") mid-scene, violating the single-POV default without a clear section break. The narrative voice is inconsistent, shifting between action and abstract, flowery summary.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.6)
    The repetition of the phrase "candidly cryptic" as a dialogue tag modifier ("murmured, voice candidly cryptic," "greeted candidly cryptic") disrupts the narrative voice and reads as a mechanical insertion. The tone is consistently melodramatic, lacking the modulation needed to make the "chaos" feel grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("shyly unstoppable," "ensconce") which breaks immersion. The tone is consistently high-poetic but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on a wash of abstract metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is often disrupted by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases, causing register breaks (e.g., "ignited the action" reads like technical direction within a fantasy scene). The prose leans toward purple, flowery description ("venomously poignant," "riotous symphony") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical insertion of required phrases, causing the psychic distance to stutter. The repetition of "carefully reckless" and "cautious exuberance" draws attention to the authorial hand, breaking immersion and flattening the distinctness of Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is strained by the forced insertion of prompt phrases like "slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve," creating awkward semantic clashes. While the technical focus is consistent, the shift to omniscient summary in the final third creates distance when intimacy is most needed.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice adopts a distant, fairytale-like tone that keeps the reader removed from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice maintains a consistent, high-lyric register that fits the genre, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("resolute as quill barbs etched in wind"). The distinctiveness is marred by lexical repetition, but the atmospheric unity is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but heavily overwritten ("ethereal prisms," "charred sigil," "liquid gold"), leaning into purple prose. The forced repetition of specific phrases ("softly ingenious," "captivate") disrupts the narrative rhythm and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but cloying, relying heavily on the "cheerful gloom" motif to the point of redundancy. The tone feels performed and overly stylized, prioritizing poetic posturing over narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.4)

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated register but suffers from a lack of distance control, merging narrator and protagonist into a single stream of abstraction. The "obsidian grace" refrain feels forced rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a "poetic" register that feels forced ("fractal dances," "ethereal veils"). There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature beyond the heavy adjective use. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone is overly elevated for the grounded context of a glazier.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and suitably gothic, fitting the ruins setting. However, the clumsy integration of required phrases ("sensitively perceptive," "after the climate shifts") creates jarring rhythmic breaks that disrupt the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is severely disrupted by the mechanical insertion of required phrases, creating a stilted, artificial rhythm. The tone aims for mythic gravity but lands on melodrama due to a lack of restraint and the intrusive repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive phrasing and overly elevated diction ("fractured grace" is used twice, "thunder" serves as a repetitive pacer). The tone often slips into purple prose that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice is severely compromised by the forced, robotic repetition of specific phrases ("bodily poetic," "alarming serenity") which appear nearly every paragraph. This mechanical insertion destroys narrative distance and distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of prompt phrases, which disrupts the rhythm and creates a stuttering effect. The tone frequently veers into melodrama ("soul's horizon," "narrative gold") that feels ungrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is undermined by severe repetitive loops, particularly the phrase "transiently rooted," which appears seven times. This mechanical cycling of specific tags destroys the illusion of a distinct, observing consciousness and reads like a prompt-adherence glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the awkward, mechanical insertion of required phrases ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") which disrupt the rhythm. The tone leans into melodrama ("fragile steam," "shivering veils") without the grounding of concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the forced, repetitive insertion of "precisely playful" as a universal descriptor for unrelated objects (whispers, straps, sparks, laughter). This creates a mechanical, unnatural cadence that breaks immersion and signals the prompt rather than the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from heavy-handed repetition of specific descriptors ("dusky," "uncloaked," "reimagined"). The elevated tone creates a distance that keeps the reader from fully engaging with Ezar's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a distant, explanatory tone that interprets events for the reader instead of letting them unfold ("Elias knew..."). The narrative distance flattens the emotional impact, describing the characters' internal states with clinical certainty rather than embodying them in voice or action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though occasionally filters the experience through phrases like "He was a man of..." rather than showing it purely through action. The rhythmic control during the breathing sequence is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative perspective head-hops during the climax, shifting abruptly from Elias’s sensory experience to Lila’s internal realizations. Dialogue feels stilted and functional, existing primarily to explain the plot and theme ("I've come back because...").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by excessive adjective stacking and repetitive tics. The frequent insertion of specific phrases ("brightened disquiet") disrupts the narrative flow and makes the voice feel mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=2.2)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its mythic, elevated tone but suffers from high-register clutter and "adjective-itis." The prose frequently tells the reader the tone ("evoking a trapped freedom") instead of evoking it through voice and distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice wavers between atmospheric fantasy and purple prose ("ethereal voids," "sanctuary of precise chaos"). The shift to a meta-authorial voice in the final paragraph creates a fatal consistency break, rupturing the established point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice aims for a mythic register but is undermined by severe repetitive phrasing ("hammered repose" appears four times; "luminous" five times). This repetition flattens the narrative distance and draws attention to the writing rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly formal and stiff, struggling to distinguish narration from the protagonist's internal soliloquies.

The reliance on a repetitive, high-flown register creates a distance that prevents intimacy with the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a "purple" tendency ("encroaching gloom," "shatter the starless void") that distances the reader. The rhyming chants, intended to inject playfulness, feel performative and disconnected from the otherwise solemn narration.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and detached, creating a fable-like distance that inhibits emotional engagement. Dialogue is stilted and artificial ("Your leaving is the cicada's molt"), reading more like a written thesis than spoken language. The tone struggles to ground the high-concept premise in human reality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the surreal setting. However, the flow is disrupted by the awkward and repetitive insertion of required phrases, which occasionally breaks the immersive texture of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice aims for a high, mythic register but is undercut by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper"). This repetition acts as a rhythmic stutter, creating a constructed feel that disrupts the immersive quality of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the surreal setting, but it is marred by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The rhythm suffers from the predictable recurrence of "glitchy," "quantum," and "shadowseam," which disrupts the immersive potential of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative voice is unnatural and mechanical, marred by the forced insertion of specific phrases ("eloquently silent" x4, "evening yawn" x3) that disrupts flow. The tone is consistently melodramatic, lacking the nuance or modulation required for high literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, oscillating between high fantasy registers and clunky, prompt-forced phrasing ("performed the action: unsnap"). The tone is breathless and overwrought, lacking the variation in distance or rhythm needed to land the emotional beats. The repetition of specific phrases ("shivering bliss") flattens the voice into a drone.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the historical setting, maintaining a respectful and somewhat elegiac tone. However, the use of prompt phrases as repeated tags ("tactfully hopeful") disrupts the organic flow of the POV, making the narration feel slightly mechanical in its adherence to constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and melodramatic, frequently summarizing meaning instead of trusting the scene ("a relic from pre-regime days," "a coded promise of freedom"). The distance is consistent, but the tone creates a barrier to immersion by over-interpreting events for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, leading to clumsy tautologies like "vested hush fully vested itself." These forced insertions disrupt the rhythm and prevent the development of a distinct, organic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, relying heavily on "as-you-know" exposition to explain the world rather than showing it. The tone is cloying, with the repetitive use of specific phrases flattening the effect. The distance remains fixed, offering little intimacy with Lir's actual experience beyond surface labels.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the repetitive "uncertainly certain" tic, which draws attention to the writing rather than the character's state. The tone leans into explanatory telling rather than immersing the reader in the immediate sensory experience of the cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice fluctuates between high melodrama ("sluiced," "ether") and clunky technical phrasing ("factually mystical"). This register drift undermines the intended atmosphere, creating a disjointed reading experience that feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache"), which breaks immersion and creates a robotic cadence. The tone vacillates between high melodrama and sudden slapstick without a cohesive POV filter to bridge them.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and elevated but veers into melodrama ("vertebrae aligning in precise rebellion"). There is a reliance on telling and abstract metaphor over immediate grounding, creating distance despite the intense subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but suffers from "purple" tendencies and overwriting. The narrative distance is somewhat remote, prioritizing description of the magic system over the immediate, visceral experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "filtering" ("noting," "analyzing") that distances the reader. The narrative stance is confident, though it occasionally slips into melodramatic descriptors ("grating symphony").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, fitting the "glass orchard" aesthetic, but it maintains a cold, remote distance that prevents emotional connection. The prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("prophetic whorls," "indifferent clouds") without offering a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature. The POV observes the spectacle but lacks the intimacy of a lived struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistently elevated and baroque, fitting the "poetically inclined" protagonist. While successful in establishing a distinct texture, the relentless poeticism risks becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fairytale register but suffers from over-filtering and a lack of distance control. The tone feels forced, relying on repeated phrases ("tinkersong wonder") to assert a mood that the dramatic action does not fully support.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is stiff and robotic, largely due to the forced insertion of mandatory phrases which disrupts the natural rhythm. The overuse of "hinged" and "sensibly eccentric" creates a semantic satiation effect that distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the forced insertion of keywords ("layered meanings," "scaffold," "reimagine"), which disrupts the rhythm and naturalism. The tone wavers between survival grit and high-concept abstraction, struggling to maintain a coherent distance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but heavily overwritten, prioritizing "poetic" diction ("umbral," "trysts," "hush") over clarity and momentum. The tone borders on melodramatic, creating a distance that prevents genuine emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, solemn register, fitting the protagonist's archetype. However, the tone is monotonous and heavy, lacking modulation between the library scenes and the intense vision. The lack of spoken dialogue (replaced by debris messages) flattens the potential for distinct character voices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, high-fantasy register but struggles to integrate the clinical prompt term "working memory" naturally ("forge of the present mind"). The tone leans into melodrama ("whisked every soul," "unquenched fire"), and the narration frequently tells the reader the emotional import of events rather than allowing it to emerge from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose that feels slightly affected. The tonal shift to the "third-grade field trip" is jarring against the "ancient/runes" aesthetic, momentarily breaking the established mood.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the mythic content. However, it relies heavily on abstract telling ("Elara's motivation burned clear") and distancing filters that keep the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is melodramatic and overwrought ("vein pulsing with ancient rhythm," "stars piercing the velvet dark"). This inflated register distances the reader and draws attention to the writing style rather than the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistently elevated and poetic, but this high register ("primal elegance," "captive dawn") creates distance rather than intimacy. The narration often explains the character's emotions rather than allowing the reader to experience them through the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which disrupts narrative distance and texture. The reliance on "telling" summaries ("contextual clues unfolded") creates a detached tone that keeps the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans heavily into "purple" prose ("clocks spiraled into infinities," "anticipatory voids"). While it fits the surreal genre, the density of abstract metaphors occasionally obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the forced insertion of prompt keywords, creating an artificial rhythm. The repetition of phrases like "warmly attentive" and "burnished hush" disrupts the immersive quality of the POV, making the prose feel algorithmic rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the repetitive use of specific tags to define the character. The shift to an omniscient summary at the end distances the reader from the protagonist's final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, prioritizing sonic aesthetics over clarity and resulting in a melodramatic register. The shift to a collective "we" understanding at the end feels unearned by the strictly limited, solitary perspective established in the first half.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent, but the bird dialogue functions purely as mechanical exposition ("Scatter north...") to direct the plot. The prose maintains a coherent tone but relies on "told" solemnity rather than earned gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice attempts a poetic register but is marred by the forced repetition of specific phrases ("wild hush," "intuitively descriptive"). These repetitions create a robotic, unpolished feel that breaks narrative immersion and distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly distanced and poetic, prioritizing purple prose over grounded observation or distinct character texture. The inclusion of the meta-commentary line ("Word count pulsed to finality") betrays the POV, revealing the artifice of the writing process rather than maintaining the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent and fitting for the genre, maintaining a fable-like quality. However, narrative filtration ("Elarion’s motivation surged") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action, substituting summary for embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the setting. However, the frequent repetition of complex noun phrases ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") creates a rhythmic monotony that disrupts the otherwise polished tone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but tends toward "purple" description ("liquid silver," "petrified roots"). The density of adjectives creates a rich texture but occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by the awkward, repetitive insertion of the phrase "fidgets productively." The tone aims for gravity but often slides into melodrama through heavy adjectival modification ("fierce repose," "woven hush").

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, leading to voice convergence where diverse characters all speak in identical high-poetic metaphors. The lack of distinct idioms makes the dialogue feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic ("eternity's dire enchantment," "oblivion's edge"). The tone creates a distance that filters immediate experience through layers of purple summary, preventing visceral engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and repetitive, using the phrase "intimately aloof" twice as a shortcut for characterization. The tone is consistently melodramatic ("fate's impatient knock"), lacking the modulation required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and breathless, relying on purple prose ("thunder that drove her away," "screaming tenderness") that distances the reader. The tone attempts high romance but lands on melodrama, and the dialogue ("You... whispered?") feels staged and unnatural. The POV filters everything through a lens of exaggerated sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and elevated register that suits the fable-like quality. However, the diction occasionally drifts into distancing abstraction ("concrete hives," "loss's atlas") that filters the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally overwrought ("winds howled elegies"). The narrative distance is generally controlled, though it sometimes slips into diagnostic labeling of emotions rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, vacillating between clinical analysis ("Gap one," "Gap two") and heavy-handed poeticism. The overuse of metaphor and adjectives creates distance rather than intimacy. The voice feels like it is performing "literary style" rather than inhabiting the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.9)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice is hampered by the repetitive, forced insertion of the "empirically intuitive" phrase, which reads as a prompt artifact rather than natural narration. The tone leans into melodrama ("trembling script," "quiet despair") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone, but it frequently slips into repetitive tagging that distracts from the immersion. The repetition of specific phrases like "softly commanding" and "lacy menace" creates a rhythmic monotony that feels like a checklist rather than an organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is suffocated by ornamental adjectives and abstract nouns, creating a distance that prevents emotional connection. The tone is monotonously reverent and breathless, lacking the modulation required for a genuine dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized, relying on "purple" phrasing that distances the reader. The tone of "jaded wonder" is achieved through direct assertion more than the texture of observation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=2.0)
    The narrative voice is unstable, shifting from purple lyricism to technical drafting commentary ("But wait, the count exceeds"), destroying psychic distance. The reliance on filter verbs and unearned omniscient insights into the past further dilutes the POV. The final paragraph reveals the narrator as an external editor rather than a coherent storytelling voice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but marred by heavy filtering ("she knew they would," "she believed") and an over-reliance on adjectival stacking. The tone struggles to balance the necessary gravity of the rite with the melodrama of the internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice convergence is a significant issue; both characters speak in the exact same distinct, heavy-metaphor dialect, making them sound like the narrator rather than individuals. The POV is consistent, but the heavy stylized filter creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice attempts a mythic register but is undermined by mechanical repetition of key phrases that disrupts the reading flow. The relentless use of specific descriptors ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") makes the voice feel algorithmic rather than curated.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric but suffers from the forced insertion of prompt phrases, which disrupts the rhythm. The shift from the grounded hydraulic terminology to the abstract "mad horologist" exposition feels slightly jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    Voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("eyes like faded constellations"). Elias's dialogue converges completely with the narrator's idiom, making them sound like the same entity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the POV is consistent, the voice is marred by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, creating a stiff, checklist-like texture that disrupts immersion and distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice suffers from excessive melodrama and a lack of rhythmic variety. The narrative distance remains static, preventing intimacy, and the overuse of adjective-noun pairings ("spectral flowers," "ethereal light") creates a generic lyrical texture. The obsessive repetition of prompt phrases disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent fairytale-like distance but leans heavily on exposition ("Rumors began to slither") and summary, preventing intimate engagement with the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy, lyrical tone, though it leans toward melodramatic affect ("whispers hummed," "forgotten dreams"). The consistency provides stability, but the lack of tonal variation flattens the emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally leans into repetitive tagging (the phrase "confidently uncertain" appears three times). The tone matches the surreal subject matter, but the reliance on abstract assertions about the character's state creates some distance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dialogue is unnatural and expository, functioning to explicitly name prompt elements rather than reveal character ("Tonight, we disrupt"). The narrative voice is overly poetic and affected ("evaporated like morning mist"), creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and melodramatic, frequently breaking immersion to deliver adjective-heavy emotional dictates ("tender ferocity"). The tone struggles under the weight of forced phrasing, creating a distance between the reader and the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, leaning into a melodramatic register that often obscures clarity. The framing device of the "universe inhaling/exhaling" feels imposed and grandiose rather than grounded in the character's immediate perceptual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dialogue is stiff and theatrical, functioning as exposition rather than natural speech ("Shouts pierce storms... whispers die!"). The narrative voice drifts into melodrama ("pocket-sized prophecies," "titans"), creating a distance that hinders immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone but suffers from high narrative distance and melodramatic phrasing ("conduit for celestial intent"). The omniscient perspective hovers over the characters, describing their states with abstract labels instead of grounding the reader in a distinct, lived-in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is affected and melodramatic, relying on vague portents ("hush where past meets prophecy") to manufacture unearned gravity. The tone is consistent but breathless, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity or distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but heavy-handed, relying on high-fantasy melodrama ("yearns for unbound freedom"). Dialogue feels staged and functional ("Cut deeper, love—fight for it!") rather than natural to dock workers, even within a fantasy context.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice successfully balances the protagonist's cold detachment with the grandiose, archaic style of her spoken performance. The distinction between the narrator's observations and the character's "act" is well-maintained, creating a cohesive and distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a distancing, elevated register that filters immediate experience through flowery abstraction. The repetition of specific phrases ("lantern-moth hush," "aesthetically driven") feels like a checklist rather than a natural rhythmic choice. POV interiority is often diagnostic ("He knew this path led...") rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fable genre, but it is marred by the repetitive insertion of the phrase "innocently cunning." This repetition breaks the immersive quality of the prose and draws attention to the prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.4)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent but creates distance through heavy abstraction and formal phrasing ("tyranny of hours," "subdued ardor"). The consistent register provides a fable-like quality, but it sacrifices intimacy and immediacy in the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.7)
    The voice is marred by the forced, verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("steadily curious," "inherited mystery") which breaks immersion. Dialogue is stiff and functions purely as an information dump ("I need to confide something," "Grandmother said we'd inherit this duty"). The narrative distance is inconsistent, toggling between melodramatic omniscient claims and limited action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register, but often slips into purple prose ("frozen scream of light," "naive skin"). The tone is heavy and lacks dynamic range, keeping the narrative at a single pitch of breathless abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, awkwardly blending high-fantasy register ("primal essence") with sci-fi elements ("comparison archive") that clash tonally. The forced repetition of the phrase "softly deliberate" (appearing four times) disrupts the rhythm and reads as a mechanical insertion rather than a distinct voice trait.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrator is overly helpful, immediately decoding symbols for the reader. The repeated insertion of the prompt phrase ("quietly vivid") disrupts the narrative distance and voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, though it leans heavily into purple prose ("evaporation's hieroglyphs," "displaced miracle's odd grace"). The tone matches the surreal intent, but the density of metaphor sometimes obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("visions bloomed," "visualized," "ignited") that distance the reader. The 1942 letter's phrasing ("love incubates eternal") breaks character voice to force a prompt word, disrupting the period authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly florid, prioritizing poetic effect over clarity or emotional grit. The high narrative distance and lack of distinct perceptual grounding make the experience feel observed from afar rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent in its lyricism but suffers from register clashes, mixing high-fantasy imagery ("petals sigh") with hard sci-fi terminology ("wave functions," "quantum weave") in a way that feels jarring. The narrative distance remains static, observing the protagonist from a detached, poetic remove.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose. The narrative distance remains stable, but the reliance on abstract concepts ("veil of rote logic," "compass of epiphanies") distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from artificial elevation and archaic phrasing ("hush of dawn," "twilight called her") that creates distance.

The narrative tone is monotonous, failing to modulate with the intended emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but distanced by high-register, "writerly" diction that filters the experience. The narrative tends to summarize Elias's philosophical conclusions rather than letting the reader infer them from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mythic tone and narrative distance are consistent and appropriate for the fable-like structure. The voice is controlled, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("constellations inched their celestial waltz").

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice attempts a lyrical elevation but often slips into purple prose ("liturgy against isolation," "blue ghosts"). The flow is noticeably damaged by the repetitive inclusion of required phrases; "periodically eternal" appears three times in a short span, drawing attention to the writing as a construct rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.5)
    Voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("awkwardly confident," "barefoot") which disrupts the narrative flow. The register feels artificial, prioritizing poetic-sounding labels over distinct, grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward melodramatic markers ("insurgent war cries," "banner of lost children") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, alternating between sensory immersion and clinical explanation of the prompt's terms. The dialogue is particularly unnatural, forcing prompt phrases ("quietly talented," "somatic markers") into spoken speech in a way that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and distancing, prioritizing purple prose over clarity ("echoing like accusations"). The POV filters the world through heavy-handed interpretation, robbing the reader of the chance to decode the scene for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornate, prioritizing "purple" descriptors ("seconds bloating into eternities") over immediacy. The tone struggles to balance the "feral" subject matter with the rigid, academic register of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.6)
    The mythic voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened register that suits the subject matter. However, the tone often drifts into distant observation, and the reliance on heavy adjectival phrasing ("feral lullaby," "velvet sky") creates a texture that feels more curated than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice suffers from "purple prose" and unnatural dialogue ("let's orbit this claim with logic's gentle gravity"). The tone feels performative, with characters speaking in thematic thesis statements rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and lyrical tone that fits the "meteor hush" motif. The POV remains firmly anchored in Elias's perception, effectively filtering the fantastical elements through his specific guilt and expertise.

    The voice is consistent but marred by purple prose and melodramatic phrasing ("impose whimsy," "unlearning haze") that creates distance. The tone feels artificial, prioritizing poetic posturing over grounded storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice relies heavily on sensory lists and abstract noun pairings to convey depth. The narrative distance is stable, though it tells the reader what to feel ("despair's brink," "rising nostalgia") rather than evoking it through distinct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct but marred by the excessive repetition of key terms (&quot;fractally precise,&quot; &quot;willowglass hope&quot;), which flattens the texture. The tone drifts into melodrama that feels at odds with the purported scientific skepticism of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice is consistent but suffers from "prompt-itis," forcing specific phrases into the narration awkwardly. The shift to distant summary in the final third breaks the established narrative intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone, fitting for a fable, but is undercut by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. While the distance is appropriate for the genre, the repetitive tagging of Elias's emotional state flattens the distinctiveness of the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice attempts a high-literary register but is severely compromised by the forced repetition of specific phrases ("prudently daring," "silver hush").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, often suffocating the action with poetic assertion ("symphony of held breaths," "velvet hush"). While the "zen" tone aligns with the protagonist, the heavy-handed filtration creates distance, making the story feel like a fable rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly poeticized, bleeding into the dialogue so that characters speak in written prose ("every door has dark corners, but gauge true..."). The "helpful narrator" explains emotions and motivations immediately, stripping the scene of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is stiff and disrupted by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases (e.g., "By the hum of an ancient stone circle" used four times). This repetition creates a robotic cadence that flattens any distinct perceptual signature. The tone wavers between high-fantasy lyricism and awkward technical jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is compromised by severe repetitive tics, specifically the phrase "inevitably whimsical" appearing four times. Dialogue is unnatural and melodramatic ("voice prismatic with quiet ache").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice struggles under the weight of forced phrase insertion ("cautiously hopeful" appears nearly half a dozen times). While the tone aims for a serious, noir-sci-fi aesthetic, the repetitive diction breaks the immersive spell, making the narration feel like a checklist exercise rather than a distinct POV.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("symphony of frozen echoes"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Elias felt," "found") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly overwrought, prioritizing poeticism over clarity. The narrative distance collapses frequently into filter verbs ("she knew without seeing," "she chose the method"), and the tone remains at a breathless, melodramatic pitch that lacks modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is disrupted by the robotic repetition of prompt phrases ("nervously confident," "reversible exile") which flattens the POV's distinctness. The tone wavers between melodramatic ("curling like doubts," "clammy maw") and mechanical, failing to establish a consistent perceptual signature for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, awkwardly blending a rustic fiddler persona with the artificial insertion of prompt labels ("Dynamically observant," "pixelated amnesty"). The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on a repetitive, adjective-heavy register that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("perceptively calm" appears four times), which destroys immersion. The tone drifts into melodramatic adjective-stacking ("bruised purple," "unyielding boundary") and lacks the rhythmic variation needed to distinguish the narrator's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a distancing, slightly archaic register ("roseate hues," "incantations") that dampens immediacy. The narrative filters experience through explanation and abstract summarization instead of grounding the reader in the visceral reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy tone but leans toward melodramatic phrasing ("serene inevitability," "insidious whispers"). This adjectival density slows the pacing and creates a distance between the reader and the immediate action, making the experience feel more observed than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("purposefully curious" x3, "anxious elation" x5). This checklist-driven cadence disrupts immersion and prevents a distinct perceptual signature from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, prioritizing adjectival density over clarity. The intrusion of the narrator's interpretation ("this is the sign") and the repetitive use of specific descriptors undermine the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice aims for a gritty, lyrical tone but occasionally overwrites ("relic of glory turned ghost"). The narrative distance is generally controlled, but the reliance on summary labels for emotional states creates a filtering effect that distances the reader from Harl's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but suffers from mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("kindly," "methodical," "touching distance"). The repetition of these tags becomes distracting and makes the narration feel constructed around a checklist rather than flowing from a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    The mythic, elevated register is consistent but creates emotional distance, occasionally slipping into purple phrasing ("cataclysm of unraveling calendars"). Dialogue tends toward the expository ("Your core fluctuates wildly"), serving to explain the magic system rather than reveal character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from an intrusive narrator who over-explains the protagonist's inner state. The tone drifts into purple prose ("devoured connection," "infinite shards") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly filtered and summarizes emotional states ("raw solace seeped in," "guilt over the accident") instead of allowing them to play out in scene. The repetition of the prompt phrase "daringly methodical" as a character tag feels mechanical. The POV distance is inconsistent, toggling between omniscient summary of his history and immediate sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and melodramatic ("veil fluttering like whispered secrets") with a heavy reliance on filter verbs ("she spotted," "she lifted," "she felt"). The perspective offers no unique perceptual signature, reading like a generic third-person account.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "purple prose" syndrome, prioritizing ornate phrasing ("spectral fingers," "humid longing") over clarity and emotional honesty. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a dense, artificial rhythm that draws attention to the writing rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but creates distance through formal, slightly archaic phrasing and heavy modification. The reliance on filter verbs ("sensed," "scanned," "glimpsed") and abstract descriptors dampens the immediacy of the POV, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is shattered by the clumsy insertion of required phrases ("timeframe of after forgiving"), resulting in jarring, ungrammatical constructions. The tone oscillates between flowery description and mechanical checklist-filling.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is heavily overwritten, relying on oxymorons ("sincerely insincere") and interpretive labels ("curated empathy") to tell the reader how to feel. The repetition of specific character tags creates a mechanical rhythm. Narrative distance is inconsistent, hovering between internal thought and external sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, using a controlled lexicon ("fractaled," "hydro-static," "visage") that fits the scientific background of the protagonist. The POV remains tightly anchored in Elara's perception. Dialogue is sparse but heavy with subtext; Voss's riddles feel earned by his enigmatic nature rather than pretentious.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice maintains a consistent, high-fantasy register that fits the mythic tone. However, the psychic distance is extreme, keeping the character and action at arm's length and preventing emotional immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, though it occasionally leans into melodramatic phrasing ("ozone-tinged glory," "automated elegies"). The POV remains firmly with Thorne, effectively filtering the world through his resentment and awe.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice uses "signifying" as a filter to summarize meaning instead of allowing action to carry weight ("The action signified everything"). This distancing effect, combined with high-register melodrama ("reverent stillness," "approving specters"), creates a barrier between reader and character.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is hampered by the rote repetition of prompt phrases, creating a robotic cadence. The frequent reuse of specific tags ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt") breaks immersion and draws attention to the artificiality of the construction. The tone attempts a high-literary register but slips into "technobabble" abstraction without grounding in a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("shattered heart," "void pits") and frequently filters experience. The inclusion of meta-commentary like "motivation fulfilled" disrupts the immersive quality of the POV, reading more like an outline than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy tone but suffers from "checklist" intonation due to the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("lukewarm," "naive," "brittle"). This mechanical tagging distances the reader from the POV's genuine experience and creates an artificial narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and overly interpretative, frequently labeling the protagonist's state ("precisely humane") rather than trusting the action to reveal it. Dialogue sounds like the narrator's thesis statement, lacking distinct character idioms or natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but suffers from heavy filtering and interpretive assertion. The narration frequently explains the meaning of images immediately after presenting them, leaving no room for reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is heavily compromised by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("soundless echo," "attentively inventive") which creates a stilted, checklist-like cadence. The tone wavers between atmospheric observation and instructional manual, preventing full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent high-concept tone but leans into melodrama ("symphonic fury," "ethereal sigils"). The register creates distance, treating the emotional stakes as abstract concepts rather than lived experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistently melodramatic and overwrought, struggling to support the thin plot. Narrative distance is awkward, shifting between internal monologue and grandiloquent summary. The repetition of the phrase "notably receptive" feels like a forced prompt insertion rather than a natural part of the narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the six-fold repetition of the phrase "mournfully eager" in a short text. This tic creates a mechanical cadence that disrupts immersion and flattens the narrative filter.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is elevated and gothic, which clashes with the "feral" identity of the guardian; the result is a character who sounds like a philosopher rather than a wild creature. The high register ("stacked infinities," "foggy lucidity") feels imposed by the author rather than arising from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is generally elevated but is disrupted by the jarring modern idiom "the penny dropped," which breaks the fantasy immersion. The overuse of repetitive labels ("stoic," "sensitive") flattens the otherwise distinct perspective and distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, blending technical jargon with mystical imagery ("creak like old bones," "void-veins") to suit the "fantasy practicality" tone. The POV remains firmly anchored in Elara’s perspective, effectively filtering the world through her specific expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is melodramatic and overwrought, using high-register adjectives ("ardent," "ethereally," "fervor") that clutter the prose. The narrative distance feels artificial, summarizing emotional states ("his positive spirit steeling him") rather than allowing the reader to experience them through the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and adjectival ("perpetual dusk," "latent power"), creating a stiff, distant tone. The lack of rhythmic variety makes the prose feel monochromatic.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is generally distinct and elevated, fitting the subject matter, but the immersion is shattered in the final paragraph by meta-commentary ("No, wait—trim to fit") that breaks the POV. This intrusion destroys the established narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is overwrought and melodramatic ("shadows pooling like forgotten sighs"), obscuring clarity. Dialogue is unnatural and stagey ("tell her the fight was love's fear, not hate"), lacking the nuance of genuine human speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic phrasing that distances the reader. The perspective stays with Elara, but the filter is often abstract, prioritizing poetic sounding constructs over immediate perceptual grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is uneven, mixing high-flown poeticisms with clunky, meta-fictional phrasing ("glitching into midnight solace tones"). The perspective distance wavers, telling the reader what to feel rather than showing the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is distant and mythic, creating a barrier to intimacy, and the narrative distance prevents immersion. The verbatim repetition of "Quietly articulate" as a sentence opener creates a mechanical rhythm that highlights the artificiality of the prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by purple prose and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("gravitationally playful" repeated three times). The tone feels forced, particularly in the "cosmic joke" segments, creating distance rather than immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to purple prose ("logic frayed into longing") that distances the reader. The flow is disrupted by the forced repetition of prompt phrases, which makes the narration feel somewhat mechanical. The tone matches the "tarnished wonder" requirement but lacks variation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is distinct and atmospheric but tends toward the melodramatic. The narrative distance is stable, yet the reliance on interpretative filters ("patterns in the void revealing who yearned to flee") distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic tone but is disrupted by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly persistent," "misting hush"). This repetition flattens the distinctiveness of the POV, making the narration feel template-driven rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining the "hushed" tone effectively. However, the reliance on poetic abstraction and elevated register occasionally creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, fabulist tone, though it occasionally feels overwrought. The distance is controlled, but the high register creates a barrier to intimacy, prioritizing poetic sound over character immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy tone but suffers from stiffness and artificiality. Dialogue serves primarily as exposition for the themes and plot mechanics ("This holds my truth"). The overuse of specific prompt phrases disrupts the natural rhythm of the voice, making the narration feel constructed and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into a dense, adjectival style that creates distance. The narration often tells the reader what to feel (&quot;crisp nostalgia&quot;) rather than evoking it through the POV's specific, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("forgotten specters," "caged echo"). POV is generally stable on Elara, though there is a slight filter breach near the end where the narrative jumps to Kai's perception ("Kai glanced back... seeing her"). Dialogue tags are sometimes excessive ("snapped," "growl," "barked").

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overwrought, relying on abstractions and told emotion ("insatiably creative," "budding hope") rather than grounded perception. The tone is monotonously reverent, lacking the modulation or distinct perceptual signature required for high-band execution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice attempts a lyric high-fantasy tone but is severely compromised by mechanical repetition. The frequent recycling of specific phrases ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest") breaks the immersive spell, making the narration feel looped and artificial rather than authoritative.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases as character tags, which breaks immersion. The narrative distance is consistent, but the reliance on "telling" via labels flattens the distinctiveness of the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly dense, occasionally breaking immersion with meta-commentary ("literal filaments mirroring narrative snarls"). The "sophisticated melancholy" often slides into melodrama, creating a distance that prevents intimacy with the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is marred by the forced, repetitive insertion of specific phrases ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") which disrupts the natural flow. These repetitions read as mechanical compliance with constraints rather than an organic narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("pierced the eternal clouds like a frozen dagger") that distances the reader. Crucially, the intrusion of the authorial drafting note ("Wait, too many—trimming in mind...") destroys the focalization and breaks the fictive dream completely. The tone oscillates between atmospheric fantasy and mechanical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overly ornate and purple ("velvet detonation," "spectral confetti"), prioritizing flowery description over clarity or character-specific idiom. This elevated register clashes with the scientific background of the focal character, creating a generic "poetic" tone rather than a distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining the "hush" and "stillness" requested. However, the lexical choices drift into repetitive patterns that detract slightly from the immersion (see Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of specific phrases ("sociably," "diligently"). This mechanical repetition disrupts the rhythm and prevents the emergence of a distinct, organic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into a high-lyric, slightly overwrought style that distances the reader from immediate experience. The narrative filter often summarizes emotion through abstract metaphors ("driftwood nostalgia") rather than embodied sensation. It reads more like a prose poem than a grounded narrative POV.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is a distant, fable-like summary that tells the reader what to feel ("strangely trustworthy," "inexplicable faith"). Dialogue is sparse and functional, used largely to insert prompt phrases rather than to reveal character or advance the scene organically.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its mythic, elevated tone, fitting the subject matter. However, the register is frequently overwrought, relying on purple phrasing ("bled bruised purple," "velvet void") that feels performative and occasionally obscures the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly fable-like tone that suits the magical realism of the setting. The perspective stays firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his weary expertise, though the transition into the action sequence feels a bit list-like in its pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "poetic" overwriting that distances the reader from the character's actual experience. The reliance on musical metaphors ("symphonically minded," "crescendo of purpose") feels forced and creates a filter over the narration. The tone remains earnest to a fault, lacking distinct textural variance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register that suits the fable-like content. Narrative distance is controlled, allowing access to Elias's specific memories while maintaining the atmosphere of a legend. The lyrical style supports the material without becoming overly obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice consistency suffers from register drift; terms like "neural paths" and "iteratively" clash with the fantasy atmosphere. The narrative distance is close but filtered through heavy adjectival layering ("unspoken dream," "sturdy brittle reality") that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is overly flowery and breathless, prioritizing purple phrases over clarity. Dialogue is stiff and functional, serving only to deliver the prompt's required multilingual element. The constant insertion of required phrases like &quot;vigorous tender&quot; disrupts the rhythm and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is buried under the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases, creating a robotic, checklist-driven cadence. The relentless use of "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" destroys any sense of organic narrative flow or distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, high-fantasy register, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The consistency is a strength, but the lack of tonal modulation makes the urgency feel performed rather than authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the forced repetition of multi-word phrases ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion"). While the lyrical tone is consistent, the mechanical insertion of these tags disrupts the psychic distance and makes the narration feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive phrasing (the attribute "thoughtfully precise" is used as a tag twice) and a tendency toward melodrama ("twilight bled purple," "iron hearts"). The tone aims for literary elevation but occasionally lands on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice suffers from affected melodrama and the awkward, repetitive insertion of the phrase "intuitively descriptive," which breaks immersion. The tone struggles to balance the requested "theatrical sincerity" with the narrative's serious themes, resulting in dialogue that feels staged and artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but stumbles on clunky phrasing like "olfactorily sensitive nose" (a redundancy) and "journalize" (an awkward verb). These slips distract from the otherwise atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is functional but slips into omniscient exposition during the artifact scene to explain the planet's history. The narrative distance is generally controlled, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("rapidly adapting," "hazy precision"), which gives the narration a stilted, checklist quality. The mechanical repetition of these tags disrupts the immersive potential of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent but heavily filtered through abstract concepts and "synesthetic" labels rather than embodied experience. The tone is elevated to the point of rigidity, lacking the flexibility to ground the character's physical actions in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register, maintaining a solemn tone throughout. However, the psychic distance creates a barrier to empathy; the prose feels performed and stylized ("shards of loss," "unraveling grasp") rather than intimately connected to the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.9)
    The POV handling becomes messy during the "swap," head-hopping between Elias and Mira ("she absorbed his relentless quest," "Mira... saw the stars' vanishing") in a way that feels like confusion rather than controlled "lucid turbulence." The voice is consistently ornate, prioritizing poetic density over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, creating distance through abstract nouns and filter verbs ("visions," "reveries"). The dialogue is sparse and functional, but the narration often summarizes emotional shifts instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts an overly elevated, "purple" register that creates distance. The reliance on ornate phrasing ("truth's boot," "sponges in the soul's vast sea") draws attention to the writing itself rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the forced, rhythmic repetition of specific phrases ("stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") which read as artificial insertions rather than a coherent stylistic choice. The tone wavers between high melodrama and mundane description.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone, but it creates distance through passive constructions and filtering. The perspective drifts between Elar and an omniscient narrator explaining the planet's state, preventing deep immersion in the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and distancing, often prioritizing poetic cadence over clarity. The filter of "half-remembered dreams" creates a haze that muffles the urgency of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=1.8)
    Narrative distance and suspension of disbelief are destroyed by the intrusion of authorial drafting instructions ("No, must hit 600-800") in the final paragraphs. The voice shifts jarringly from atmospheric fiction to mechanical error log.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into melodrama ("tears of manic glee"). The reliance on performative tags for laughter ("giggled," "crowed," "chortled") creates a repetitive and distracting rhythmic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but heavily reliant on adjectival stacking ("valley-mist shrouded," "hushed wonder") and abstract nouns. While the tone holds together, the narration often "tells" emotions and realizations ("not with fire, but revelation") instead of evoking them through distinct focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, polished, and suitably lyrical for the fable mode. It maintains a distinct "storyteller" distance, though it occasionally leans into abstraction ("quantified sorrow flowed into the dream-map") that distances the reader from the tactile reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "emotional ventriloquism," asserting the feelings of spectral characters ("felt his solitude crack") rather than showing them. The tone is often breathless and overly reverent, creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice suffers from melodramatic, elevated diction ("stroking the edge of midnight's embrace") that creates artificial distance. Dialogue is stilted and functions as plot coupons ("In mistake's shadow, wisdom gleams") rather than natural human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose ("steam curl like confessions," "snapped like accusations"), which distances the reader from the immediacy of the encounter. The integration of required phrases is jarring, particularly "heuristically gentle," which clashes with the established poetic rhythm. The POV feels filtered through a writerly lens rather than the character's lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is hampered by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "gently meticulous" five times, which reads as a mechanical tic rather than a stylistic choice. This repetitive tagging creates a droning rhythm that undermines the attempt at a sophisticated, "hushed" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the forced, verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("curiously steadfast," "comforting unease"), which feel artificial and break the specific POV immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, oscillating between high-register poetic prose ("terrestrially cosmic") and a jarring, mechanical meta-voice at the end. The POV breach in the final paragraph ("But wait, trim to fit") breaks the frame entirely. The diction often leans into purple prose, prioritizing ornament over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic phrasing ("shimmering silence," "luminous melancholy") that distances the reader from the immediate action. The tone is homogeneous, lacking the modulation between the practical (accountant) and the artistic (painter) sides of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like tone that suits the subject matter. The distinct perspective of the calligrapher filters the world effectively, though the rhythm occasionally flattens in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized, leaning into high-fantasy register that occasionally feels detached ("frame of forgotten purity"). While the tone is unified, it risks sounding like a summary of a legend rather than an immediate, lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, effectively blending technical terminology with poetic description suitable for the genre. There is occasional filtering ("Zeta's vision stuttered") that distances the reader slightly, but the perspective remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dialogue is unnatural and expository, forced to carry plot mechanics ("The locket's chain leads through following the fountain's trickle..."). The narrative voice is stiff and occasionally overwrought ("vessel of untold history"), creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, prioritizing "lyrical" descriptors over clarity. There is a palpable distance between the narrator and the immediate physical reality, created by a reliance on filter verbs and high-register abstraction ("intoned," "masked," "propelling"). The POV feels constructed to deliver keywords rather than to inhabit a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but leans into purple prose ("birthed from evaporated seawater"). Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a unified high-fantasy tone. However, the register often drifts into "purple" territory with overwrought descriptions ("crisp as forgotten stars") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the forced and repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("mysteriously familiar," "patiently nimble"), which disrupts the natural cadence. The tone wavers between mystical intimacy and the harshness of the word "interrogate."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from high psychic distance due to relentless adjectival filtering ("mournful luminescence," "spectral figure"). The melodramatic register flattens the emotional specificity, making the experience feel performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts an artificially elevated register that prioritizes flowery phrasings over clarity. The tone is relentlessly serious and melodramatic, lacking the modulation needed to make the emotional beats land effectively. The distance prevents intimacy with the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice attempts a high-fantasy register but falters with stiff dialogue and overwrought descriptors. The narration suffers from "telling" over "showing," particularly when explaining Elyra's tactics ("guide them through progressive disclosure") instead of letting them unfold naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, mythic quality but suffers from repetitive phrasing, notably the phrase "borrowed starlight" appearing three times in a short span. The narrative distance remains somewhat remote, observing the ritual rather than inhabiting Elara's visceral experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, relying on poetic abstraction ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") that feels performative. The register drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience. The prompt-mandated phrases are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies on repetitive filter verbs ("intuited" used twice for key realizations) and descriptors ("sharp/sharply" used three times). This lexical repetition weakens the authority of the third-person perspective and creates a sense of "telling" rather than immersing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and overwrought, often prioritizing sound over sense. The register drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its fairytale register but suffers from forced integration of prompt phrases ("positively wistful promise," "lonesome splendor"). The tone is earnest but veers into sentimentality, lacking the friction or distinct perceptual signature of a high-band voice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent and overly "purple," utilizing strained metaphors ("cries vibrating the air," "orgasmic clarity") that break immersion. The POV filter feels artificial, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over coherent perception, making the character's experience feel performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but marred by unnatural phrasing forced by prompt inclusion ("Unyoke them softly purposeful"). Dialogue reads as artificial exposition, and the narrative distance is static, lacking the modulation of intimacy that accompanies genuine danger or epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is distant and explanatory, often summarizing emotional states instead of embodying them. The narration relies on telling ("she was watchfully calm") and creates a filter that prevents intimacy with the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, oscillating between high-flown poetic diction and awkward prompt-phrase insertions ("aptly deliberate"). Dialogue feels artificial and stagey, serving to explain the plot and theme rather than revealing character or advancing the scene naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is distinct but marred by mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("irreverent awe," "steadily curious") that creates a robotic cadence. The narrative distance is too great (summary mode), preventing intimacy with the protagonist's immediate sensory experience. The tone creates a "fable" feel that distances the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice begins with a consistent noir-tech tone but collapses completely during the climax due to the intrusion of meta-commentary regarding word counts. This breach of the fourth wall destroys the reader's trust in the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is a consistent high-fantasy style but leans into melodrama. The integration of required phrases occasionally disrupts the natural cadence, making the narration feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("hypothermia's afterglow"). Narrative distance is generally managed well, though it occasionally slips into explanatory mode.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.0)
    Dialogue is stilted and unnatural ("Come in, wanderer," "clashed with my earth's steady brown"), failing to capture the rhythm of actual speech. The narrative voice suffers from severe register drift, jarringly mixing flowery melodrama with dry academic terminology ("intersubjective understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a mythic tone but is shattered by severe keyword stuffing. The algorithmic repetition of phrases like "strangely honest" and "whisperfield calm" creates a robotic cadence that prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive, frequently labeling emotions ("earnest whimsy") instead of evoking them. The tone feels manufactured through adjective-heavy telling rather than emerging organically from the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the scholarly/poetic tone of the piece. However, the reliance on repetitive phrasings for atmospheric markers ("suspended hush," "fractured sequences") limits the freshness and dynamic range of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. It occasionally slips into affectation, prioritizing poetic sound and elevated diction over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly purple ("pixels of fire," "primal fury"), creating a distance between the reader and the action. The affectation of "wisdom" feels performed, and the prose texture is marred by the mechanical insertion of required phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly precious, blending flowery description with diagnostic abstraction ("reunify what time stole"). It frequently "tells" the emotional state of the room rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the quadrupled repetition of the phrase "quietly deliberate," which reads as a mechanical tic rather than a stylistic choice. This repetition flattens the distinctiveness of the POV and draws attention to the writing's construction over the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by forced vocabulary and semantic errors ("dawn's first blush innovated the horizon"). The tone fluctuates between flowery archaicisms and robotic keyword insertions, destroying any sense of a consistent persona. The POV filter is clogged with these linguistic artifacts, preventing access to the character's genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is overwrought and repetitive, relying on a limited loop of poetic words ("zephyr," "bloom," "resurface") that dulls the narrative texture. The intrusion of clunky, prompt-forced phrasing like "reflectively vibrant" disrupts the established high-fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly interpreting symbols and emotions for the reader ("symbolizing resilience"). The tone is monotonous, and the dialogue feels artificial, sounding more like written poetry than spoken interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, purple diction ("solemnized into print," "ephemeral cameo") that distances the reader. The tone lacks the modulation needed to distinguish the quiet tension from the feral danger.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" description that creates distance. The POV asserts traits (whimsy) that are not borne out by the solemnity of the ritualistic action, creating a disconnect between voice and event.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice aims for high lyricism but stumbles into archaic affectation ("The world exhaled not") and clunky, prompt-driven phrasing ("demonstrated it physically now"). These slips break the narrative spell and distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a meditative tone that suits the subject matter. However, the register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("silence hung like a shroud," "dusk bled mauve") that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice attempts a poetic register but is severely hampered by un-idiomatic phrasing (the repeated adverb "boundary-lessly") and the mechanical insertion of prompt terms. The tone is consistent, but the frequent repetition of complex noun phrases ("kerosene lamp burner," "whalebone reverie") creates a robotic rhythm that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting ("steam threading upward like a genie's promise"), and the heavy reliance on filter verbs distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a slightly elevated, mythic tone suitable for the setting. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled. However, the voice occasionally slips into repetitive labeling of the prompt's concepts rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on telling emotions via abstract labels ("wonder tempered by quiet math"). The tone often drifts into flowery abstraction rather than grounding the character's perspective in sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice oscillates between standard narration and forced poeticisms. The repetition of specific phrases ("excruciatingly gentle," "petrichor nostalgia") disrupts the narrative distance and draws attention to the author's insertion of prompt elements rather than the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the forced, repetitive insertion of required phrases ("By training instincts," "thoughtfully clear"). This creates a robotic, template-like cadence that breaks immersion and prevents a distinct, consistent persona from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical, slightly elevated tone. However, the narrative distance is static, and the dialogue occasionally drifts into unnatural exposition ("Philosopher of seeds, eh?"). The repetition of specific prompt phrases damages the immersive quality of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, distancing the reader with filtered descriptions and high-register poeticisms ("filigreed patterns," "bruised purple"). The tone creates a barrier to intimacy, making the character's emotions feel performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its archaic, somber tone, and the single POV is maintained. However, the prose rhythm is severely hampered by a "template cadence" of repeated phrases and filter verbs ("he hypothesized"), which makes the voice feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and poetic ("pulverized midnight"), creating a distance from immediate experience. The insertion of the prompt phrase "gracefully alert" feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm of the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly ornate, prioritizing "purple" descriptions ("temporal adhesive," "liquid songs") over immediate interiority. The POV filters the experience through explanation rather than sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone, but it is heavily compromised by mechanical repetition of keywords and refrains. The overuse of specific terms ("pings," "petals," "sigh") flattens the voice, making it sound more algorithmic than authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the tone is consistent, the voice is compromised by the clumsy, mechanical repetition of prompt-specific phrases ("spectral mentorship," "thoughtful"). The prose leans into purple descriptors that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from melodramatic affect and excessive modification. The tone struggles to modulate, maintaining a high pitch of "searing" intensity that deadens the impact of the quieter, redemptive moments.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is mechanical and heavily repetitive, cycling through a limited set of specific descriptors ("antique sovereign case," "uncharted echoes," "blithe") like a checklist. This creates a drone-like rhythm that flattens the emotional variance and draws attention to the writing's artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the high-fantasy setting. However, the narrative distance feels somewhat stiff, keeping the reader observing Elias rather than fully inhabiting his visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy reliance on repetitive poeticisms ("thistle," "ember," "dust") that create a monotone effect. The prose maintains a "writerly" distance that keeps the reader observing the style rather than inhabiting the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent "somber marvel" tone that suits the gothic-surreal atmosphere. However, the non-diegetic drafting notes ("No, trim later—wait...") left in the final paragraph shatter the narrative stance and destroy the immersion at the critical moment of closure. This breach forces a cap on the score despite the high quality of the preceding text.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwritten, aiming for a "philosopher's rasp" that occasionally veers into purple prose ("echoing like gravel in a sieve"). The tone struggles to balance the intellectual register with the grimy reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative voice is stiff and visibly constrained by the forced insertion of prompt phrases, leading to awkward syntax. The repetition of "traveled stillness" and "expectantly resigned" creates a robotic cadence that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable, but the narrator is overly "helpful," explaining the character's wisdom and the fruit's mechanics instead of letting them play out. The voice often drifts into clinical jargon ("synaptic plasticity") that clashes with the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated but veers into purple prose ("useless sentinels," "venom from a wound"). The rhyming riddle is a bit twee for the gritty setting. The POV remains stable, though it occasionally over-explains Elias's inner state instead of trusting the action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, creating distance rather than intimacy. The tone remains static throughout, maintaining a "hushed reverence" that dampens the potential for urgency or distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("animate lifeless haven," "forgotten heartbeats"). The elevated register fits the mythic tone but occasionally stiffens the narrative flow. The distinction between the narrator and the statue's "voice" is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but stumbles on awkward phrasings like "balancedly daring" and tonal missteps like "seismic belch." These distractions break the mythic register established by the opening, though the rhythm of the mathematical ascent is well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative suffers from a significant breach of POV distance in the final act, head-hopping from Elias into the minds of the old woman and the night-shift worker to explain their motivations. This breaks the established close third-person limitation without a structural transition.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is disrupted by the clumsy, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("historically oriented," "displaced persons") which appear as distinct tags rather than integrated description. This mechanical repetition breaks the immersive quality of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the forced insertion of prompt phrases, which creates a mechanical, repetitive cadence. The tone attempts a mythic quality but is undercut by the unnatural recurrence of specific labels ("bleak exhilaration," "counter-clockwise") that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily overwritten, leaning into "purple prose" clichés like "eyes fluttered open" and "silken rasp." The melodramatic tone struggles to balance the required prompt phrases, which often jut out of the sentences (e.g., the repeated "repulsive allure") rather than blending into a natural distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent in its mythic tone but suffers from didactic intrusions that break the POV, such as the dictionary-style definition of "Dub." These shifts from immersive storytelling to explanatory lecture undermine the established atmospheric authority.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suited to the mythic tone of the setting. It occasionally drifts into purple prose with heavy adjectival stacking ("gargantuan," "labyrinthine," "dread-laced") that creates a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explicitly interpreting symbols and emotions for the reader ("marking the end of summer's illusions"). The tone is consistently melodramatic, using elevated diction that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is overly helpful, interpreting every action's significance immediately after it happens. The tone leans into purple prose ("quiet fury," "black nectar"), creating a distance that feels performative. The narrator dictates what the reader should feel rather than evoking it through the focalizer’s sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the forced insertion of multi-word prompt phrases ("tranquilly perceptive calm," "logical page indexer"), creating a stilted, mad-libs quality. The rhythm trips over these insertions, preventing the development of a distinct or natural narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but exhausting, locked in a high-fantasy register that refuses to modulate for pacing or impact. The relentless elevation creates a monotone effect where "dying embers" and "tea cups" are treated with equal gravity. There is no distinct perceptual signature beyond a filter of "glowing sadness."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("whine like a lover's whisper") that feels overwritten. The reliance on explaining emotional states directly ("It was bleak exhilaration") weakens the immersion provided by the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("mirrored the void's eternal astonishment") and struggles with naturalism in dialogue ("The action: pull"). The tone feels forced, with characters speaking in expository bursts that sound like instruction manuals rather than organic conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The repetition of "quell" and "sieved hush" creates a robotic, checklist-like cadence that disrupts the reader's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic. The insertion of prompt phrases like "uncommonly thoughtful" directly into descriptive narration breaks immersion, making the voice feel like a vehicle for a checklist rather than a character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.0)
    Voice is marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("merrily melancholic" appears five times), which creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm. The narrative distance feels inconsistent, shifting between gritty physical detail and melodramatic self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and relies on repetitive refrains ("jaded wonder" appears four times) to tell the reader how to feel. Psychic distance wavers between immediate sensory data and abstract, diagnostic summaries of the characters' pasts.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the robotic repetition of prompt keywords ("paradoxically steady" appears six times), creating a distracting, artificial rhythm. The tone aims for grandeur but lands on purple prose ("pyre of forgotten stars") that distances the reader from the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a high-register, mythic tone throughout. The focus is tightly controlled, staying deep within Lirien’s perception. However, the relentless intensity of the voice sometimes distances the reader, prioritizing poetic effect over immediate emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is elevated but suffers from repetitive phrasing to satisfy prompt requirements ("ghostly resolve" appears four times). The tone feels forced and artificial rather than organic to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overwrought "fable" tone that prioritizes poetic-sounding phrases over clarity and character distinctness. The distance created by this style prevents deep psychological access to Elias, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the forced repetition of specific phrases ("winking hush," "calmly inventive") that disrupt the natural flow. These repetitions feel like inserted keywords rather than an authentic part of the narrator's idiom. The tone aims for mysterious but veers into purple prose ("swallowed the light like a thief in velvet gloves").

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice aims for a mythic, lyrical register but often stumbles into abstraction and noun-heavy phrasing ("grace born of necessity," "hues of stolen sunrise"). While the tone is consistent, the density of conceptual keywords ("patterns," "promise," "understanding") creates a distancing effect that mutes emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently melodramatic, prioritizing poetic-sounding phrases over clarity or grounded perception ("ozone scent of revelation," "applause from scarred ancestors"). The tone feels artificial and forced, filtering the world through a thick layer of interpretative adjectives rather than concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    Voice is marred by forced phrasing and unnatural dialogue ("You arrive while I unravel secrets"). The narrative distance wavers, often prioritizing the insertion of specific keywords over character-authentic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dialogue is stiff and expository ("Monthly molt... It's how I forge beauty"), sounding more like a thematic prompt response than human speech. The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, prioritizing poetic affect over emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from heavy filtering and elevated diction that distances the reader. The frequent insertion of prompt phrases disrupts the rhythm, making the voice feel constructed around keywords rather than organic to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is compromised by severe lexical repetition, with specific prompt words ("luminous," "doubt," "empirically whimsical") recurring frequently enough to create a robotic cadence. The tone aims for high fantasy but is undercut by the mechanical insertion of these keywords, which distracts from the established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is consistently overwrought, utilizing a melodramatic register ("spectral galleon," "voice fracturing") that feels artificial. Dialogue is stilted and archaic ("Behold," "I seek"), failing to capture natural human speech or distinct character voices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elena’s perceptual signature—fractal scales read as spectral noise. Rhythmic control mirrors data reduction: long clauses swell, then pare to stub sentences (“Truth emerges in patience.”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. One register drift—“Conceptual Repricing”-level diction in “preprocesses reality”—is brief and motif-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is glass-artist: light fractures, internal glow, heat-cool cycles shape every metaphor. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for starlit frost, staccato for shard strike. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; “luminous resonance” becomes mantra, justified by craft.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tightly locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—salt-etched skin, vibration in sternum—never drifts into committee voice. Syntax mirrors her tuning logic: parallel “struck high and fast / low and slow” cadences act as auditory metaphors rendered in silent vibration. No head-hopping; Kai’s interior is mapped only through heat glass, preserving distance control. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a musician-survivor; only one near-cliché (“frozen Eden”) but immediately rejustified by POV wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is oceanic—long, rolling clauses that mimic surge and drag, yet compressed to urgent fragments when air thins: “He ignored the mounting pressure in his lungs, diving…” Perceptual signature is grimly tactile, never touristic: Elias sees “drowned tomes swelled with eternal silence,” a phrase only an undertaker-librarian would coin. No dialogue appears, so voice modulation is carried through syntax alone; the shift from languid reminiscence to shard-by-shard staccato mirrors rising hypoxia. Compression and ellipses are pattern-taught early and paid off in the breath-starved final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains “amplified quiet” cadence with controlled repetition. Perceptual signature is communal-collective rather than individuated, fitting exile chorus. No head-hops; distance stable. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Tomas’s grumble and Lena’s fierce addendum carry subtext. Register drifts slightly elevated (“malevolent fireflies”) but patterned early, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person hovers at mid-psychic distance, tightening to body-sync breath level during healing—clean control. Diction stays within Elias’s artisan-monk register: “spiritually curious,” “pinhole,” “pearlescent,” never academic. Rhythm lengthens during breathing instruction, then shortens for packing exit—purposeful modulation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but perceptual signature (seeing sparks, reading wounds as light-blockage) remains character-specific and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual warp: hyperbolic jargon, horticultural precision, and synesthetic tremor. Syntax elongates then fractures under retrocognitive flood, mirroring the “quivering lattice.” No head-hopping; even the garden’s “whisper” is filtered through his designer’s ear. Register remains elevated yet anchored in his lifelong craft, earning high-band control.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person cinematic-close hovers just outside Elara’s skin, filtering every notice through her tactical priorities: “rusted chains” before color, “coordinate grid” before music. Rhythm flexes—clipped clauses under arrow-fire, longer sweep when Wall roars—without losing lucidity. Diction stays inside a rogue agronomist’s lexicon: “bioluminescent vials,” “drought-proof maize,” never grad-school purple. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat; voice is singular, muscular, and taught by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is oceanic-gothic: brine-tinged consonants, drowned-sailor metaphors, and syntactic swells that mimic currents. The perceptual signature—“colors roared, then quieted”—is unique and carried through without register drift. One hairline slip: “regeneration stirred within him” edges toward textbook diction amid volcanic ash, but the rhythm recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lush, cadenced lyricism—“amber fire,” “liquid jade,” “moonbeams spilling”—yet always Elara’s selective attention: vibrations, angles, whispers. No head-hopping; distance stable. Compression taught early: “golden-hour portrait thief” condenses myth. Perceptual signature—flowers as ciphers, light as syntax—remains distinct. Rhythm accelerates with fleeing beats, then softens into awe. No dialogue to contaminate voice. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mock-epic, glassblower-as-demigod voice is consistent, rhythmically varied, and purpose-driven; it teaches the reader to treat furnace-tending as saga. Compression like “weighty lightness” is patterned early and pays off in the final laugh. No head-hop or register drift; diction stays within Elias’s visionary lexicon. The only minor slip is occasional template cadence in the declamatory lines.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is stunt-performer sharp: kinetic metaphors (“smile a rusted blade”) match occupational risk vocabulary. Perceptual signature narrows to kinesthetic detail—pulse, grip, swing—mirroring her profession’s body-centred world. No head-hop; single POV stays tightly interior. One micro-slip: “transformative betrayal” tagged as phrase rather than shown, but absorbed within otherwise specific diction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person focalization clings to oracle’s tidal ear; perceptual signature is consistent—“pebble-shore” diction, wave-like cadence. Syntax lengthens during silence-listening, contracts at star-wink, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; Elara stays externalized appropriately. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “appeared”) avoided; immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tight third-machine POV; diction stays within sensor lexicon—servos, calibration, sublimation. Rhythm mirrors mechanical precision yet flexes during the sustained chord. No dialogue, so voice carries entire load; succeeds. Filter verbs (“he noted”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elias’s sensorium, filtering everything through auditory obsession (“subtle comings and goings of souls”). Syntax elongates then contracts to mimic breath-held listening: “registering only… registering only…” Patterned repetition is taught early and paid off in the final hush. No dialogue means voice distinction is judged through perceptual signature alone—achieved. Diction stays inside Elias’s quiet lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is horticultural: sky “bruised with dusk,” roses “thrusting defiantly,” scanner hum “coldly.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, then shortens under auditor challenge, mirroring Elias’s breath. No head-hopping; auditors’ interiority is guessed through Elias’s lens only. Compression is taught early (“vine dresser,” “orb scanners”) and stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—tools hum like heartbeats, starlight is recycled parts—creating rhythmic, mechanically tinged diction. No head-hop; Lirren’s interior is implied only through visible breath and dialogue. Compression (“trim to fit—actual count adjusts”) is meta-textual graffiti; ignore as non-narrative artifact. Syntax flexes with pressure: long clauses for obsession, fragment-like bursts at lever pull, mirroring lateral time slices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual lens—sound of water slapping wood, visual glint on wet paper, kinesthetic tug of string against lantern. Syntax lengthens under tension then fractures into staccato clauses as flood escalates, mirroring bow pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through filtered sensation and action; diction stays within a working musician’s lexicon. One tiny filter slip: “conceptual cost” in closing paragraph edges toward meta, but recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s sensory cascade; perceptual signature is distinct—“peripherally aware,” “auroral sorrow,” “reluctant prophecies.” Syntax lengthens and fragments under fever pressure, then compresses during the smudge act, mirroring emotional arc. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext convincingly. Register holds high-literary without drifting into purple because every elevated phrase roots in her body or the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Jax’s perceptual filter; no head-hops. Diction—“drowsy alertness,” “rusted skeletons of industry”—creates a consistent, slightly fevered rhythm mirroring sleep-deprived focus. Portable-radio crackle and caller diction are differentiated without forced dialect. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory verbs (“gripped,” “crunching,” “snapping”) keep immediacy. Voice modulation peaks in the one-word caller shriek, compressing syntax under stress; closure hush returns to longer cadence, earning 9- band with micro-slip of “forever changed” cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is sustained lyric–archival: “shelves sagging like weary shoulders,” “congealed night.” Syntax elongates to mimic slow drift, then compresses during burrow—rhythmic control serves pressure. Diction stays within spectral scholar lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature is consistent: light is swallowed, time is measured in fungal bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s wind-listening, sage-scented perception; diction is lull-soft yet precise. Free indirect slides cleanly—e.g., “his softly adaptive melodies” mirrors his own cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal rhythm flexes with eclipse chill. The repeated adjective “softly adaptive” edges toward template cadence yet remains motif-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited voice is consistently perceptive, compressed, lyric: “bronze quiet,” “dreamless void,” “skewed sky” all issue from Thorne’s idiom. No dialogue, so distinction bullets waived. Patterned elision (“half-remembered regrets… echo-layered”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses spiral like dust, then snap to short declaratives at the mountings; no syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature leans toward cryptic compression (“ink and dough,” “muted life now resonated”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for fog-bound rumination, staccato for beam Morse. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom is consistent and purposeful. One filter-verb cluster—“he saw his chance,” “he felt sharper”—slips in the peak beat, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: he “decorates with silence,” notices “gaseous tendrils,” hears pedal clicks as prayer. Syntax tightens into catalogued rhetorical fragments under stress, then exhales into the final long sentence. No head-hop; diction remains ecclesiastical-technical (“zeugma,” “chiasmus”) yet plausible for a scholar-priest. Rhythmic control is exact—loops literally shape paragraph cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-composer: long accumulative sentences that swell like orchestral bars, then contract into single-note fragments (“She collapsed gently”). Perceptual signature is synesthetic—light fractures into scores, wind becomes flutes—consistent with a fortune-writer who hears paper speak. No dialogue beyond the boy’s whisper, and that line carries subtext: her fortunes always hinted, implying she has been composing toward this moment for years. Psychic distance tightens from cosmic dawn to spiral grooves without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Poetic yet precise diction—“raindrops suspended mid-fall like crystal beads”—establishes rhyth mic control; compressions (“darkening brightness”) are pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly anchored to Elias’s sensory frame even during time jumps. Psychic distance modulates credibly: panoramic hover narrows to heartbeat count under threat. Voice stays distinct and internally coherent through peak beat of shadow absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lingers inside Elara’s vibration-filtered perception: every sound is “audibly muted,” every emotion arrives through bone. Syntax lengthens in reverberative clauses that mimic echo, then fractures into imperative signing gestures under pressure. No head-hop; Thorne’s tears are seen from outside, keeping POV clean. Distinct perceptual signature—palette of hush, tremor, wire—reprises in final sentence, reinforcing voice unity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited sustains a precise, instrumented diction that feels born from Elara’s notebooks. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under dusk transition, longer accumulative sentences when cross-referencing logs. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-close hovers at intimate distance; perceptual signature—light fractured into “crystal shadows,” scent as “sweet decay laced with honeyed rain”—remains consistent. Syntax flexes with pressure: long rolling sentences for nostalgia, fragment-like bursts at bloom climax. No dialogue, hence no voice-convergence risk. Register stays within plausible lexicon for bereaved botanist-supplier. Patterned repetition of “as the transformation completes” acts as ritual cadence, taught early, paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is poet-perceiver: synesthetic ("velvet murmur," "starlight-veined canopy"), rhythmic internal couplets mirror spiral syntax. No head-hopping; distance remains tight interior. Compression taught early ("three nights prior") and paid off in fused final cadence. Diction stays within itinerant poet lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Lir’s acoustic filter: “echo-harbor violinist,” “violin weeping” remain within his poetic idiom. Sentence rhythm lengthens and softens during music beats, mimics bowing. Compression is taught early (“chronic hush settled”) and paid off. No dialogue or head-hop; voice coherence under stress is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is perfumer-precise yet emotionally compressed: “affectionate veil,” “whisper of oud,” “static smoothed into a steady hum”—diction stays inside Elias’s vocational lexicon. Rhythm tightens under pressure, fragments and participle opens vanish at climax. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“Thank you for the half-truth that feels whole”)—reads as intentional stylistic restraint rather than omission.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person focalization clings tightly to Elias’s shrewd-perceiver filter; perceptual signature sharp in cargo-net simile and profit-minded crowd scan. Free-indirect slips once—“whimsically attentive eyes”—a metallic descriptor outside his diction. Dialogue sparse but functional; when spoken, syntax differentiates widowed reserve from dockside briskness. Rhythm safe, repetitive clause-and-comma cadence flattens urgency; no elision taught or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter: “frost-kissed branches overhead,” “reed-like veins of leaves,” diction organic to her craft. Rhythm swells with the group’s growth—longer cadences as “laughter echoed rarely”—then contracts to short clauses at the apex: “This is it.” Lir’s single line of dialogue carries regional restraint (“haunts me too”), distinct from Elara’s oratory final sentence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; psychic distance remains steady mid-depth.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Narrative voice is lush yet controlled, diction anchored in an illustrator’s perceptual lexicon (“embryos of roars, whispers unfurling like ferns”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for sweep, fragments for tension. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“cadences… dissonance… nascent sounds”) is consistent with Elara’s scholarly sensibility; not a drift.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, lyrical, yet anchored in conjurer’s perceptual bias: “spells woven from dew and shadow,” “dovetail guides, interlocking arcs.” Syntax flexes—parallel branches mirror fractal theme—without monotony. No head-hop; single POV stable. Register stays within plausible diction for a secluded scholar-mage.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Diction (“petrified rivers,” “ferric tang”) is sensory, within a crawl-space dweller’s lexicon of rust and dust. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for stealth, staccato “He nodded. Voice a rumble.” at emergence. No dialogue contamination; the two spoken lines carry distinct idiom—his sparse, hers breathy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature botanist-precise (“veins pulsed as if breathing”). Syntax elongates then fragments to mimic vine growth vs. human falter. No head-hopping. Filter verbs present but voice-motivated (“he felt” = bodily alienation). Final whispered line stays inside his new sap-thought register.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited stays latched to Thorne’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax swells with sonic verbs (“chime, cascade, hum”) that mirror cave music. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature favors aural over visual. Dialogue sparse but differentiated: Elara’s cadence is oracular, Thorne’s terse farm-bred gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—angles, calligraphy, compass bearings—threads every sentence. Rhythm swells and contracts with descent, punch-thunks acting as metronome. No head-hopping; diction stays within his lexicon even at lyric heights.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyrical, slightly elevated dience remains consistent with Elara’s star-map precision. Perceptual signature strong: “indifferent stars,” “salt air without resolution.” One POV, no leakage. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for whale songs, clipped for storm. No dialogue to test, so voice cohesion judged on narration alone—passes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is high-register, mythic-lyric, yet internally coherent—syntax lengthens under storm-light, contracts at collapse, matching cosmic scope. Diction stays within an immortal’s sensibility: “refracted shadows,” “chaotic symphonies,” “prismatic infinities.” No dialogue, so voice convergence test is waived. Perceptual signature is strong—Elowen sees folds, flux lines, rebel dimensions—anchoring POV distance. Minor register drift: “conduits for spatial dissent” leans academic, but the phrase appears once and is earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Eli with con-artist perceptual signature: quantitative noticing, hidden-pocket reflex, chemical zest as data. Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments during breach mirror pulse. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Vapor metaphor is legible and pattern-taught early. Voice distinctiveness sustains through final line; one clause (“math prevailed, fair and flawless”) nudges toward template cadence but remains within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable, filtered through Thorne’s perceptual bias: he catalogues hum pitch the way a bibliophile smells bindings. Diction—“incandescent restraint,” “thumbnail petals”—is elevated yet consistent with his gilded vocation. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is nil; prose rhythm breathes with long accumulative sentences that mimic waveform layering. Minor 0.1 discount for two near-repetitions of “earnestly studious” within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person voice maintains a tidal cadence—long swells, then short percussive clauses at discovery. Perceptual signature is consistent: every sensory note is run through the “layered skins” filter. No head-hop; diction stays within dock-side lexicon; figurative control peaks in “label curling like a mocking tongue” without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked on Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is wry, salt-stung, cadence-heavy: “gloomy cheerfulness,” “cheerful in its mournful lilt.” Syntax mirrors pressure—crescendo of clauses before shell flakes. Diction stays within coastal, myth-buster lexicon; no academic drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice carries all subtext successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “neon-lit frenzy,” “gears’ spokes traced a cipher.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for carnival sweep, staccato clauses for stealth painting. No head-hop; only minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) feels academic but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—crater dust “like forgotten dreams” is his romantic overlay, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens under oxygen anxiety, then fractures into short flare counts, mirroring breath. No head-hop; scientific register stays within 1972 astronaut lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s tactile ear-eye; no POV drift. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during hum-decoding, mirroring magnetic pulse. Register remains artisanal, never academic. Refracted light as perceptual signature is sustained, not decorative. Dialogue sparse but cadenced: “Bring the water features” carries command gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person psychic distance stays tight to Harlan’s perceptual filter; diction (“ordnance survey,” “cartographic enigmas”) belongs to his atlas tongue. Rhythm modulates: clipped clauses under ice-cracks, longer sinews when tracing myth. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture and succeeds. Purposeful elision—no guardian shown—teaches the pattern of withheld finality and is paid off in the closing salute.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, incantatory cadence that mirrors the tuning-fork hum; sentence rhythms swell and subside with the scene’s pulse. Diction stays elevated and consistent, never drifting into unintended academic register. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is more choral than individual, fitting the mythic mode, though Elias’s interior texture remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric distant enough to render biolum palette yet close enough for gloved tactility; perceptual signature is diver-logical—measures distance in fin-kicks, notices silt displacement. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Register never drifts above POV lexicon; metaphors (“spectral flower,” “living serpents”) stay within undersea register. Rhythm accelerates with single-clause sentences as O₂ dwindles, mirroring pulse without drumbeat template. Filter verbs minimal; “she felt” only once at legitimate distance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias with perceptual signature—copper colors, salt taste, spiral geometry—never ventriloquizing guards or shades. Rhythm accelerates via parataxis during squeeze-passages then elongates with caesuras in the hush core, mirroring breath control. Diction (“wolfish howls made manifest,” “threaded complete”) borders on mythic yet stays anchored in tactile interaction with lattice and stone. No head-hopping; unreliability surfaces only through Elias’s selective memory of reef collapses, paid off when ghosts corroborate. Filter verbs (“felt,” “glimpsed”) are limited and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: spiraling runes, luminous fruit juices, winter-cracked hush recur with obsessive cadence that mirrors alchemist mindset. No head-hopping; POV stays latched to Elias except for brief legitimately external ghost sightings. Compression and elision (“days blurred into nights”) are taught early and paid off in final timeless union. Dialogue absent by design; voice distinction therefore judged on narrative idiom alone and remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)

Voice modulates from mourning hush to dawn hush, consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent archaic cadence—“ere it breaks,” “thy path”—that fits pilgrim lore without drifting into purple. Perceptual signature is lightly present: Elara notices botanical minutiae, maps, amulet, all filtered through an antiquarian eye. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm breathes with dusk-to-dawn cycles. A few template stems (“Across final days… she fitted…”) momentarily flatten propulsion but recover.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-loyal: “soft whirs from dormant vendor pods blending with the coo of synthetic pigeons” layers sensory specificity with futuristic nostalgia. Filter verbs are rare; perception is direct: “she etched one final chalk heart” not “she felt like etching.” No dialogue, so no head-hop risk. Parallel syntactic cadences (“juxtaposing… against…”) are deliberate, teaching the reader the structural pattern that closure pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person close clings to Elara’s synesthetic perception: silk murmurs, candle “approves,” leaves “tap-tap like footfalls.” Diction stays aged-domestic—“silly stars,” “silly weather”—never drifts into stargazer jargon despite astrophysical stakes. Syntax mirrors embroidery rhythm: paratactic clauses, thread-like commas, occasional breath-length fragment. No head-hop; courier’s interior stays opaque. Compressed elision (“By dawn’s gray promise…”) taught early and paid off when chart blooms complete without step-by-step exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct lyric texture: alliteration (“bruised silvers,” “lotus-hearted threnody”) and hyphenated compounds create Pacific-patois music without caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric close-up maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“pensive mirth,” “lantern hum with captured dawn”—is character-locked. Syntax mirrors fog drift: long, clause-layered sentences that breathe. No head-hopping; network voices filtered through her sensorium. Filter verbs (“felt,” “sensed”) are voice-motivated, not clutter. Dialogue absent, so no convergence issue. Rhythm control peaks in final paragraph cadence that thins fog clause by clause—earned 8.8.

    Third-person close stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature (“paint breathes anew”). Distinctive synesthetic diction—“sonic sculptures,” “overripe echoes”—is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; Lena’s interiority is inferred through embodiment, not ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—his rogue grin, scholarly relish for fractal scripts. Diction (“hyperbolic curves that defied Euclidean tax ledgers”) matches his academic bent. No head-hopping; Voss remains opaque, seen only through Elias’s gaze. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences during warp bloom, staccato clauses when doors buckle. Clean control.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, focalized through Elowen without head-hop. Perceptual signature is ornate—pearlescent, abyssal, phosphorescent—yet consistent with a poet who literally inlays verse on walls. Rhythm swells toward hexametric cadence at climax, mirroring lullaby crescendo, an intentional musical pattern. No dialogue appears; voice coherence rests on diction control and salt-crusted metaphor that never retreats into plainness.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent glass-lit diction: “opal,” “iridescent,” “crystalline resonance.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elara’s caretaker gaze—she never notices what a tourist would.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is machinist-tinged: brass links, solvent brew, hydraulic valves. Rhythm mimics volcanic inhalations, taught early and held to final sentence. Diction is consistent, slightly elevated but within surveyor- engineer lexicon. No dialogue, so voice test is prose-only; it passes.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “pitted surface whispering,” “motes in light blooming,” diction precise yet romantic. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for mapping fugue, clipped fragments at betrayal. No dialogue overload; when spoken lines surface (“like stars trapped in wind”) they carry subtext of consent. Filter verbs appear but feel character-apt (“he believed it held,” “he began learning”). Consistent control with one momentary POV drift into Lila’s interior at “eyes wide” that costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric, compressed diction stays inside Elowen’s perceptual signature: “featherly,” “cornstalk labyrinths,” “veined like forgotten maps.” Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic breath under pressure. No head-hopping; father’s single line is external. Non-standard punctuation (em-dashes, fragmented quotes) is pattern-taught and pays off in the final “fractured no more, yet ever hushed.” Voice modulation under intensity is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual signature—constellations from drowned geometries, “softly ingenious mind”—syntax mirrors her associative leaps; no head-hopping. Filter verbs serve voice (“she felt the rhythm at last”) rather than dilute. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Theo’s diction slightly more technical, hers more mythic. Register stays within plausibly submersible-poetic idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tight to Jasper sustains a physicist-performer perceptual signature—“sea breeze velocity,” “crowd density variables”—without head-hop.

Free-indirect flows without filter-verb clutter; voice stays singular and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Close-third firefighter POV holds; perceptual signature is tactile—ember handling, hose wisdom—but diction drifts into lyric register (“celestial dance”) that feels authorial rather than Elias-born. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under breath-catching, longer coils for reflection. Dialogue minimal and natural; only Elias speaks at length, so voice distinction test waived. No head-hop or filter clutter; celestial framing is pattern-taught early and paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers at mirror-distance, matching Elowen’s elusive nature; diction stays within painterly lexicon (prismatic, refracting, mirage). Rhythm swells with lullaby cadences, then fractures into shorter glints as mirrors yield. No head-hopping; perception remains strictly Elowen-filtered. Voice modulation under stress is subtle—breathless clause stacks during inhalation of heartbeats, then calm declaratives after sync.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined: syntactic parallelism (“carved…veined…lingered”) teaches the cadence early and pays off in the final rhythmic halt of the stars.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is compressed, cadence mimics a cylinder’s uneven rotation—staccato clauses, then elongation under honey-thick air. Perceptual signature is Elias’s silent calculation (“he schemed not with weapons but with patience”) and Thorne’s bodily grammar (fists, convulsion, exhale). No head-hop; every perception is filtered through either Elias’s scheming calm or Thorne’s cellular memories. Diction stays inside pacifist-philosopher lexicon: “visceral recall,” “cellular memory,” never academic overload.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s archivist sensorium: she catalogs, hums folk tunes, notes “threshold born of misalignment.” Syntax is methodical, slightly old-world, matching occupational lens. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat. The only micro-slip: “sanctuary of precise chaos she cherished” edges toward slogan, but it is isolated and early.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: thistle-blown, prism-song, star-looped repetitions taught early and paid off in the final blaze.

Sentence rhythm swells with storm then cuts to single verb “roared,” mirroring pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly close to Archivist’s perceptual filter (“preemptively nostalgic heart aching”). Diction—stormlit, crystallizing, preemptively—feels archival, not thesaurus-churn. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed clauses under lightning flickers, then settles into longer cadence for hush. No dialogue, so subtext conveyed through gesture and whispered fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric third-person hovers at Elias’s sensory frequency—kerosene scent, petal rustle, chant cadence—compressing time without head-hop; rhythmic parallelism (“Spin the knot, sift the night”) is pattern-taught and paid off in the closing twirl.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric distance sustains a consistent, tide-drenched diction: “phosphorescent waves,” “mollusk shell cracking open.” Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Elaron’s chronicler gaze, not tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lush, airborne syntax mirrors Elara’s aerial craving; diction stays within her skyfarer lexicon (“sky-roots,” “dandelion seed”).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Compressed lyric diction—“shadowseam wonder,” “sporelight”—teaches its pattern early and holds; rhythm accelerates with clause fragments at the twist.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elowen; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—alchemical lexicon fused with chivalic restraint—renders “shivering bliss” and “frayed strings” idiosyncratic rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Eleanor; perceptual signature is archivist-sensory (dust as data, ink legibility, “brittle scraps”) and grief-textured (“echoing hush,” “sagging shelves like weary sentinels”). Syntax lengthens with wonder, then shortens when she pries the seam, mirroring breath control.

Rhythm swells with incantatory cadence during chant and crucible scene, then shortens to two-word breath at coin’s balance, mirroring tension/release. No dialogue contamination; Thorne’s single line is spare, voice-distinct from narrator’s lush register. Filter verbs (“she knew”) are minimal and motivate micro-choices, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person intimate sustains ultraviolet synesthesia throughout—every noun filtered by retinal burn and proprioceptive echo. Syntax grows comparatively terse under spasm beats (“Her legs buckled proprioceptively”) then lengthens during integrative calm, mirroring neural waveforms.

Dialogue-free design suits solitary survival scenario, keeps voice singular.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Theo’s technician perception: dust as wear-indicator, mainspring as seized mechanism, ghosts as “weightless burden.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—sentence fragments (“The buzz faltered. Flickered. Died.”) mimic the failing light without breaking clarity. No head-hopping; ghost interiority is implied only through gesture and moan, keeping POV modest. Distinct perceptual signature sustained through final image of pocketed barrel.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is Elias’s pattern-hungry gaze, filtering every leaf and whorl as omen. Syntax compresses under pressure—“rupture inevitable / awakenings rustled forth”—mirroring the staccato press clacks. No head-hopping or register drift. The only micro-slip is the abstract noun cluster “singular, shattering now” that edges toward thesis, but cadence still serves climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Baroque-rococo syntax mirrors asteroid architecture: stacked clauses, gilded adjectives, iambic cadences in interior monologue.

Dialogue absent; narrative voice sustains rhythmic control without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)

Dialogue absent, so no voice contamination. Patterned elision (“infinitesimal adjustment”) is taught early and paid off at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—petrichor, clinks, mineral breath—creating a distinct texture. Syntax flexes with pressure: short paratactic clauses during hinge pulls, longer humid cadences in lagoon stillness. No head-hopping; psychometry visions retain reported-frame distance (“Visions hinged open…”) so narrator remains modest.

Dialogue absent by design; voice remains distinct through sensory diction and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: runes on robes, extinct tongue cadences, wax grooves felt as “shed skin.” Rhythm mimics incantation—long latinate clauses that tighten into monosyllabic vows under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is seed-saver scientific mystic: diction of “botanical relics,” “defiant structure,” “viscous as honeyed fog” stays inside Elara’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with the vortex—long, luminous clauses spiral, then snap to short beats: “She plunged her hand.” No head-hopping; POV remains tight third. Perceptual signature is biased toward taxonomy of texture—everything is felt as grain, silk, viscosity—mirroring her obsession with tangible time.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: meteorologist’s lexicon (“pressure gradient,” “wind shear”) filtered through poetic ear. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for hush, clipped fragments for micro-variation spikes. No head-hopping; POV stable. Prose teaches pattern of recurring “solstice hush” and pays off in final toll. Register stays within Elias’ plausible lexicon; no corporate drift. Near 9.0 but syntax occasionally over-adorns (“jagged peaks and whispering spires”) without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric third-person glides in tight psychic distance; diction (“primal elegance,” “stellar fury”) stays within Elias’s poetic lexicon.

Voice distinctiveness peaks at tear-comet line, securing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric compresses into beekeeper idiom: “phantom blooms,” “smoke-stained aprons.” Sentence rhythm mimics heat-mirage waver—long breathless clauses that dissolve into single-word fragments: “Mute eloquence.” No head-hop; POV stays tight to recluse. Filter verbs are voice-motivated: “He saw the method clearly” precedes epiphany, justified by perceptive trait. Dialogue absent by design; silence is the story’s native tongue.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is horologist-turned-mercantile mystic: “eternal sheen,” “irrational sums,” “timeless shard, feels the weave of eras.” Syntax glitches under stress—fragments like “borrowed time felt thinner” mimic arrhythmic heart. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged through interior monologue; diction stays within self-taught tinkerer range, never academic. Pattern of cryptic listings taught early and paid off in final broadcast; compression (“$irrational”) becomes legible code. Rhythm accelerates at shard-touch, then settles into mercantile cadence of new listing—intentional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “whispered secrets,” “quiet pulse of flight,” “cobalt heart beating on.” Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under snap-shock, then steadies for the chant.

Rhythm teaches its pattern early and repays it in the final hush, earning high-band control.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyrical, stable at reflective distance; perceptual signature in botanical precision—“roots drawing mineral life”—and wire-spiral diction. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for calm, staccato “By noon, ten branches gleamed” for pace. No dialogue, so voice rests on description; occasional elevated register (“arboreal entities”) drifts from caretaker lexicon but stays consistent. Copper, quartz, hum recur as patterned chant, paid off in final lattice glow.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s skeptical-perceptual filter: “rainwashed stone,” “luminous speck mirroring her glowing doubt.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses in calm, staccato “illicit scans revealed” under pressure.

Diction (“neurotransmitters engineered for euphoria”) fits scholar-rebel lexicon without academic register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close adheres to Thorne’s perceptual signature—salt-tang, dead-language cadence, seed-rattle diction. Syntax lengthens during Eldari incantation, then compresses at scatter beat, mirroring ritual breath. No head-hopping; seabird speech is filtered through his linguistic ear. Register stays within coachman’s plausible lexicon; “ancestral dice” and “salt-crusted wood” feel idiosyncratic, not thesaurus-churn.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited clings tightly to Elias’s tracker sensorium—smell-of-decay, nose-to-earth—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under trek pressure, longer lyrical curls at twilight. “Intuitively descriptive” diction stays within POV lexicon, though the phrase itself repeats as self-conscious tag. Dialogue is sparse and natural, Harlan’s rasp distinguishable in a single line.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-cosmic yet body-anchored: ‘temporally stretched trails’ and ‘gilded applique caught starlight’ compress relativity into sensory texture. Syntax lengthens under dilation—comma-rich cadence mimics time stretch—then snaps to staccato at the leap. No head-hopping; the camera stays inside Elara’s perception, her navigator diction filtering every star and vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is dense, cadenced, and consistent—“benevolently ruthless purpose,” “nomadic penumbra”—with metaphoric diction that never drifts into abstraction; the lyric register is taught early and paid off in the final absorption of the shadow, no head-hopping or register slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, perceptual signature fused to Elara’s mercury refractions: “visions flickered like liquid silver.” Syntax lengthens under trance, shortens under pain—“she whispered the syllable” lands like pulse. No head-hop; feather and stone are focalized through her skin. Register stays within plausible antiquarian-bookstore lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “his fingers fidgets productively” renders the grammar slip as idiosyncratic motor habit. Syntax mirrors chess logic—short, diagonal clauses that fork like knight moves—then widens into labyrinthine hypotaxis during contemplation. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The diction never exceeds a tutor’s lexicon except when “winnow” appears, justified by the agrarian-etymology motif taught in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric_accumulative voice taught by line 3: “forged hush” syntax compresses nouns into adjectives (“bone-spined sky”) and sustains the pattern to the last line. Perceptual signature is painterly—light, fracture, smear—never generic. Rhythm escalates with crowd chant cadence, then thins to solitary scratch of charcoal at end; modulation purposeful. No head-hop; Elara’s filter holds. Dialogue sparse but distinct: boy’s stammer vs. elder-kin’s hesitant ray vs. sentinel’s gravel growl each carry class-age texture.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric-acid diction—“corroded hull bubbling with fumes that clawed”—is sustained, rhythmic, POV-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature—synesthesia of color, scent, vibration—without head-hop. Diction (“cobalt,” “night-blooming cereus,” “nocturnal perfume”) is specific yet within his keeper’s poetic lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with breath/sea sync; no template cadence. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“You... whispered?”) and distinct from narration’s lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s scar-fixed perception; no head-hop. Diction—“gritty comfort,” “fox-fire glow”—is navigator-poetic yet internally consistent. Midnight phone voices carry distinct gravel/hiss timbre without drifting into exposition. Rhythm accelerates with coil winding and flame strike, mirroring cardiac spike, then exhales at dawn. Compression and elision (“twist left under gibbous”) are taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s sensor-focused idiom: geomagnetic, pH, “earthy bounty a rational anchor.” Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses during insertion, longer lyrical cadence in gloaming reflection. No head-hop; Lira and Thom remain opaque except through Elias’s relief at their thawing suspicion. Distinct perceptual signature carries to the final clause: “whole in his duality,” where fractured sight becomes identity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature—opal shimmer equated to “frozen whispers”—remains keeper-specific and lyric without purple overload. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses mirror fog, then fragment under memory intrusion. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is internal monologue texture: “Softly persistent, Elias whispered to the sea” sustains cadence while varying syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close sustains map-dealer perceptual signature—angles measured in calipers, terrain read as contour lines. Syntax tightens under stress: “Kneeling amid the blooms, careful not to crush…” mimics cautious physical control. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“he saw them: a trail of ants…”) they serve revelation beat. Diction stays within plausible lexicon except perhaps “empirically intuitive clarity washed over him,” a rare elevated patch.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited hovers at velvet distance, never leaking outside Elowen’s ken. Syntax glimmers: “gown trailing like spilled mercury” is perception-specific, not tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distilled-chemical diction (“solar spectrum precision,” “logarithmic grace”) and syntax mimic spiral compression; rhythmic control tightens into the whisper beat’s fragments. Perceptual signature is unmistakably Lirien’s—every sense measurement carries romantic intuition. No head-hop; POV remains anchored to Lirien, Thorne observed only externally.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is irreducibly Elara: resin-clung flannel, raven-quill, “jaded wonder” as self-diagnosis. Syntax warps under pressure—fragments and em-dashes mimic lucid-break fragmentation—then re-solidifies in the dawn coda. No head-hop; focalization stays locked. Diction stays within mountain-ranger lexicon; no thesaurus-itis. A masterclass in prose-as-character.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is scholarly-lyric (“steam curled like forgotten sigils”, “crystals bloomed along lengths”). Syntax lengthens during ritual calm, fragments under pain: “Pain lanced, but not destruction.” No head-hopping; diction fits runic apprentice lexicon. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is earned by final reweighting image. Rhythm modulates with ceremony tempo; read-aloud cadence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice owns a gossip-columnist’s perceptual signature: every noun is half-snark, half-reverence—“spectral tea,” “poltergeist paramours.” Syntax crackles like the piano wiring—comma splices carry charge, then snap to em-dash fragments under spark contact. No head-hop; Theo’s dialogue is reported as trembling harmonics she interprets, keeping focalization clean. Diction stays within her tabloid lexicon even at peak stress—“grit-glazed grace” is flashy yet plausible for a woman who types hauntings for coin.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains a consistent cosmic-register lexicon (“galaxies whispered,” “spiral arbitration”) that feels apt for an eternal witness. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for awe, staccato fragments (“He walked faster outward…”) under rising hush. No head-hop; perception stays strictly with Elowen. Minor echo: repeated “wanderingly exact” phrase; still reads as motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is compressed horologist cant: “temporal pastures,” “brass veins,” “fjord ice”—tight, rhythmic, never purple. Perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s caliper-eye.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual signature: four-dimensional refraction mapping, “quiet wildfire” diction. No head-hopping; Elias’s interior stays opaque, as it must. Syntax flexes with pressure: short clauses when she spins, then elongates during beam tracing. One elision—“the farm’s yours till birdsong”—is taught by context and paid off when she pockets the device. Register stays within her tech-poetic lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Free-indirect texture is consistent: Elena’s perception tilts toward probabilistic metaphors (“odds reset,” “quantum superpositions”) without ever ventriloquising her father. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under subway fluorescents, longer sweep during library quiet. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained; the rare elevated term (“mica pane,” “filigree”) is justified by academic lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-loyal: “shadows clung like forgotten secrets,” “melodically haunted—ethereal wails twisting into sighs.” Syntax mirrors tunnel compression—clause-stacked, breathless—then relaxes into laconic hang-ups. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tightly bound to Elias’s gravelly remove.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias: synesthetic ink-scent, pollen as stardust regrets.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person omniscient distance stays consistent; lyrical compression (“rumors slithered through ivy”) teaches the pattern. Diction favors sensory nouns/verbs (“creaking bicycle,” “feral cats meowing secrets”) and rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to short quips under lantern light. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice carries distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays glued to Elar’s sensorium; every metaphor is tactile—“ring hummed,” “notes etched into air he felt on his skin.” Syntax lengthens during absorption, then fractures into shorter units at the clearing, mirroring the cadence shift from search to stillness. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; the few murmured words (“Lead me”) retain ember-low register consistent with introspection. Perceptual signature is irreplaceable: only a blind dowser could “read” ultrasonic braille.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person stays tight inside Elara’s perceptual filter—“celestial signal interpreter” diction colors every noun. Rhythm flexes with gravity: long clauses drift, then snap short at the click of unbending. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted (memories already rewritten) but never breaks causality. Voice is unique to this frame—no stock space-poet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Finn’s perceptual filter—stars are “forgotten,” melodies “evaporated”; syntax swells and pauses mimic wave rhythm; no head-hopping; sign-language passages use italicized whispers that teach the reader the pattern without breaking immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)

The final whisper is syntactic diminuendo that lands the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lush lyric register sustains coherent perceptual signature: “velvet shroud,” “auroral sorrow,” “mournful spears” all filter through Elara’s heightened sensorium. Rhythm accelerates with scene—short percussive clauses mirror rising tempo. No head-hop; Kai’s voice enters only as vibration synced to hers, maintaining distance control. Compression taught early (“vibrations bloomed”) stays legible to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: geomagnetic interference, gait signatures, crease logic. Syntax tightens under pressure—“Fold your steps like the map”—mirroring compression. Harlan’s dialogue is bombastic, Elias’s replies sotto voce, maintaining vocal contrast. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric-accumulative voice stable throughout: archaic cadence (“spiralingly calm”) taught early and repeated without variance, reads intentional. Perceptual signature skews to reflective surfaces—puddles, mirror, wet planks—mirroring Elara’s star-redirecting obsession. No dialogue, hence no head-hop risk; single POV maintained. Register stays within canal-keeper lexicon; metaphor chain (moth wings, heartbeats, galaxies) is controlled, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)

Rhythm modulates: longer languid sentences in grotto, staccato clauses during sync moment, mirroring tension breath.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices net tangles, whalebone warmth, Kai’s voice crack. Distinct idiom: “seal in boots,” “chained to these planks,” dock-worker diction. Rhythm compresses under pressure: “Cut deeper, love—fight for it!” mirrors pulse of sawing. No head-hopping; Kai’s interior accessed only through exterior cues and dialogue tone. Filter verbs minimal; sensory immediacy dominates. Voice convergence at kiss is brief and intentional, acceptable under rule. Meets 9- quick test: perceptual signature stable, no elision untaught.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is a porcelain mask speaking grand opera: syntactic arches (“Behold the whittle begins!”) mirror the turbine blades. Diction stays inside her lexicon—she would say “titans” and “flora and forge.” Rhythm accelerates with the knife, breathes at each “Behold,” never breaks character. The blank face never leaks into explanatory interiority; performance is the only diction we get.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close adheres to Elias’s tactile, color-blind filter; perceptual signature is consistent (“fingers tracing warped curves”). Diction stays within plausible artisan register; no corporate drift. Rhythm modulates: short sentences under climbing pressure, longer lush cadences for dawn/dusk transitions. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal and natural.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays inside Elowen’s perceptual filter: every noticed detail is sonic or tactile, never visual for its own sake. Syntax lengthens and compresses with bell-decay, creating ambient rhythm without drumbeat monotony. “Powerfully gentle” is the only tic; it recycles but also serves as her mantra, so forgiven once. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; narrative diction remains within plausible lexicon for a bell-ringer-poet.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate maintains jeweller’s tactile diction—“callused fingers,” “fine awls,” “burnishers”—without leaking into omniscient exposition. Rhythm swells into symmetric cadence during ritual beats, mirroring origami folds; compression tightens under lantern glow.

    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “dew-kissed fog,” “quietly vivid,” “shimmering stillness” are idiosyncratic without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences mirror mist, then shorten at the pouch beat. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture, which passes. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory verbs (“breathed,” “cradled,” “misted”) keep immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elena’s synesthetic bias—she tastes “meteor hush” and hears ivy “in verdant rustle.” Syntax compresses under stress (“sand thawing slightly, urging time’s fragile flow”) yet remains legible. No head-hopping; plant telepathy is external voice, not POV leakage. Some elevated diction (“meteor hush,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts above plausible lexical ceiling, but pattern is taught early and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric hovers at psychic distance 2–3, maintaining consistent moon-biased perceptual signature (“light bending through voids”). Syntax is patterned, almost liturgical, but the repetition serves accumulative design rather than monotony; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is hypnotic, compressed, syntactically ritualistic—“Hush now, little embers”—teaching its pattern by line 3. Perceptual signature privileges shimmer, pulse, throb; diction stays inside a night-watchman’s narrowed lexis.

Compressed lyric pattern—seraphically mundane, frost-bitten hope—taught early, paid off in closing image. Rhythm modulates: long clauses during numb ascent fragment at discovery. No head-hop; Thorne’s interior accessed solely via Elias’s archival link, within POV warrant.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Lirion’s perceptual sieve: “dust motes hung eternal,” “ink bloomed rusty-black.” Syntax lengthens into cadenced clauses that mimic constellational pause, then snaps short at collapse. No head-hopping; diction remains archaic yet precise. One near-lapse—“regally unpretentious” feels editorial rather than perceived—barely grazes the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—rhythms of tapping encode memory, scientific diction shrinks to Morse-like pulses. Sentence cadence mirrors tidal rise/fall, varying naturally; no template drumbeat. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which remains salt-corroded and mechanical. Register never drifts into academic editorial; “calcium dust,” “gyres,” “polyps” stay worker-level precise.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cosmic register: “bruised skies bled,” “thunderous serenity.” Syntax swells and contracts with Elara’s awe, no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is stargazer-poetic, never committee-voice, and stays stable under pressure.

Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under freeze: “Her breath caught; her body betrayed her first…” demonstrating rhythm control. No dialogue contamination; the two spoken lines carry subtext of invitation rather than exposition. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is painterly and synesthetic: “gaze splintered into prisms of light” is perceptual signature, not ornament. Rhythm modulates—long clauses mirror spiral ascent, then staccato down-beat clauses mimic descent. No head-hopping; unreliability (seeing faces twist) is consistent until loom corrects. Elision of how loom operates is taught as mystic pattern, paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elowen’s perceptual filter: “porcelain skin gleaming unnaturally” is his self-consciousness, not author description.

Diction remains within a tracker’s lexicon; no corporate register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—“her breath the only warmth”—with clean psychic distance. Rhythmic compression under pressure—“fingers danced”—mirrors the illicit upload. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical third-person stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception (“whispers of wind as unspoken secrets”) without purple drift. Syntax mirrors her calm: long breathy sentences until looters arrive, then clipped beats. “Sheathe” as one-word sentence at climax crystallizes stance. No head-hopping; Jax’s softness is shown externally.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual signature: every image is cast in fisher terms—currents, hooks, hauls, tides. Syntax lengthens during calm, fragments during spike-tremble, mirroring tension. No head-hopping; constellation movements are observed effects, not omniscient exposition. Distinct diction (“sonic phial,” “feral lullaby”) feels innate to this world rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual filter: star-wheel mocks, ink scent, nib warmth; no head-hop. Distinct diction—“orbit this claim with logic’s gentle gravity”—marries scientific idiom to playful cadence; syntax remains controlled under pressure.

Syntax shortens under chant crescendo, lengthens again during hush, mirroring pressure. Diction stays within her artist lexicon; no register drift. Dialogue is brief, indirect, and differentiated—Marta’s unvoiced glare vs. Theo’s tremble—functioning as compressed action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: “veins of regret,” “arms of steel”—metallic, fractured, prayer-haunted. Syntax lengthens and compresses with retrocognitive floods, then cuts short at the whispered rename, mirroring her pulse. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Voice never explains what it has already shown; retrocognitive plunges are dramatized, not diagnosed.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person hovers close to Elena’s synesthetic register; diction stays inside a magician’s lexicon (“spotlight,” “greasepaint,” “fanfares”). Rhythm swells with the song, then contracts into short sentences at exit, mirroring breath. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory verbs (“tasted like vanilla spotlights”) keep immediacy. Patterned elision (echo mechanics left vague) is taught early and paid off at closure, acceptable under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person close clings to Elara’s perceptual bias—fractal visions, ozone scent, willowglass metaphor—without leakage into Theo’s mind. Syntax mirrors her jittery skepticism: stacked participles, hyphenated coinages, light-drenched nouns. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual (“Feel that?”). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift, yet remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is synesthetic cartographer: verbs like “gnaw,” “dance,” “bleed” fuse geological and bodily processes. Rhythm crests with tidal cadence—long sentences for surge, fragment (“She etched”) for final carve. Emitter’s heat palette creates a perceptual signature distinct to Lira’s augmented eyes; no head-hop. Diction stays within plausible post-human lexicon—“bioluminescent veins,” “cryogenic slumber”—without academic drift. Compression taught early (“relentless waves gnawed”) and maintained; closure line “forever charting emotions that float beyond sight” reverberates with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices via tactile amber, spiral runes, lantern fireflies—details filtered through his custodial/artisanal gaze. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer lyrical sentences in quiet beats, clipped fragments (“Doom sands…”) during echo spill. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Register stays within plausible lexicon for a solitary turner.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person sustains silver-mist tonality; diction (“zephyrs whispered in silver hush”) is consistent, never purple. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays body-anchored. Cadence modulates—long breaths for approach, staccato for burst signal—without template monotony. Elias’s interior idiom distinct from Lena’s breathy diction; differentiation holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the coachman’s perceptual filter—raindrop rhythm mirrors stitch cadence. Diction (“spindrift,” “palimpsest”) is within his artisan lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kai’s potter-perception: clay weight, wheel torque, sun angles. Diction is concrete, rhythmic, sand-lashed: “chimney smoke…flattened like ink on dusk.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under thrumming beat. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated. One hairline slip: “zen mind quieted chatter” borders label-speak, but immediate tactile follow-through saves it.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close stays pinned to Elara; no head-hop. Diction—“luminous harbor silvered like spilled mercury,” “oars crossed like patient arms”—is lyric yet consistent with a gardener who sees the world in tools and tides. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for moonlit description, clipped fragments when Mira speaks, mirroring her thread-thin voice. Dialogue is minimal but indirection is observed: “The harbor listens best at night” carries invitation, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s aerial sensorium; diction of “atomically reflective,” “iridescent lattices” belongs to her scholarly lineage. Rhythm swells and ebbs with mist-tides, sentence lengths mirroring tidal inhale/exhale. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs minimal; perception fused with motion. Psychic distance tightens from floating observer to winged sovereign without unmotivated shift. Compressed syntax under peak beat—“Isolation ends here”—reads intentional, ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains perceptual signature—ink, feathers, refracted color—without filter-verb glut. Diction stays within Elara’s poetic but human lexicon; cadence swells at reunion without drum-beat repetition. Dialogue sparse and natural, though Theo’s idiom converges with Elara’s in climactic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person voice maintains a consistent archaic-fable register that suits the nexus-myth frame. Syntax modulates—short gasping clauses under mutiny, longer lyrical cadences in starlight—without losing control. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; perceptual signature is strong in Elias’s selective attention to architectural detail.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-POV interiority stable; perceptual signature vivid (“fog thick as sodden wool,” “spongey portent”). Free-indirect style clean: “maps never lie” carries her evangelic cadence. Compression purposeful: elided travel from sea to archive taught by context. No head-hoping; psychic distance narrows under dread. Dialogue sparse but natural (Hale’s “oozed” confession) with subtext of guilt. Rhythm mirrors nervous confidence—short bursts against rolling clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice is lyric, rhythmic, violin-like; cadence mirrors bow strokes (“notes rose, luminous against the dusk”). Diction stays within a folk-musician’s lexicon; no academic leakage. Compression taught early (“luminous haze of disbelief”) and paid off in final “shone.” No head-hops; perceptual signature is consistent—sound-oriented, crowd-reading, motion-sensitive. Dialogue is absent but voice sings without it.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: bruised-purple sky, currency edges “like reading fates,” hoops “pulsing like watchful eyes.” Rhythm swells into lyrical catalogues but compresses when thugs arrive, mirroring his controlled pulse. No head-hop or register drift; the occasional adjective stack (“harmonious shades of bruised purple and fading gold”) is patterned early and pays off in the closing dusk echo.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, syntax lengthens under dream pressure then fractures at gasped awakening.  Perceptual signature sharp—Thorne notices star ratios, ink stains, petal creases; Lyra notices spiral curves.  No head-hopping; single POV holds.  Diction stays within lexicon of astronomer-poet without academic drift.  Rhythm modulates: long breathless dream sentence collapses into short spoken revelation, mirroring cognitive snap.  Meets 9+ quick test; hairline slip is occasional alliterative excess (“blanket of solace”) that reads self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person tight stays strictly in Thorne’s perceptual funnel: “runes of forgotten pacts” is druid-filtered, not tour-guide. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed fragments when vines bite, longer clauses when guilt surfaces. No head-hop; “spectral voice” is externalized memory, not omniscient intrusion. Rhythm mirrors spiral tightening without algorithmic drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric POV sustains a consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic color-sound, vegetal diction, pulse-and-vein motifs compress Elara’s mind into the glade’s vascular rhythm. Syntax frays into parataxis under visionary pressure, mirroring root-tangle; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays inside a mystic-naturalist lexicon—“sigil,” “sap-blood,” “fractal echo”—without register drift. Voice is the story’s most controlled engine; it almost disguises the plot’s absence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyrical voice maintains dusky, incantatory cadence; diction (“snaked between bleached bones”, “earth’s hidden markets”) stays within lexicon of occult initiate.

Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature consistent; no POV leakage or dialogue to contaminate voice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose carries a distinctive scholarly-mystic cadence: “wedge-shaped script whispering of transitions,” “cosmic secrets,” “Lorentz force shearing bonds.” Patterned repetition (“kindly, methodical”) is taught early and pays off in the final benediction, legitimizing the litany. No head-hopping; POV distance stays snug to Elias’s perceptual filter—clay, copper tang of ozone, dew-currents—achieving a singular voice that survives the lyric loops.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lens keeps titan-gear distance yet lets steam, chimes, tidal breath filter through Elara’s skin. Syntax mirrors pulse—long tide-sentences crash, then short “She gasped.” No head-hop; librarian’s interior only via joint-whir and furnace-vent. Only blemish: occasional elevated “ethereal essences” drifts from Elara’s earthy cartographer tongue (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to refracted light and mineral breath, never drifting into committee voice.

No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; interior texture remains singular and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is consistent—precise surveyor diction (“quadrant-by-quadrant,” “palimpsest”) collides with raw, unmedicated sensory flood (“serpentine whispers,” “frantic crisscrosses”). Rhythm breathes with accordion: long, wheezing sentences in decay, tightening to clipped notes at climax. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Elias. Filter verbs (“feeling,” “seemed”) are voice-motivated, showing mind relearning embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lush, lyrical free indirect style stays inside Elara’s perception; diction (“velvet,” “spectral,” “mulberry ache”) forms a coherent idiolect. Syntax mirrors synesthetic pressure—long, sliding clauses under midsummer humidity, clipped fragments at bow lift. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens with stress. Patterned repetition (“mulberry ache,” “propagate”) is taught early and recharged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is incantatory, compressed, and synesthetic—”auroral whisper,” “phosphor bloom”—perfect for a lone officiant who thinks in ritual fragments. Syntax elongates then snaps (“Infuse, she whispered”) mirroring the helix pattern she threads. No dialogue, so the narrative sings itself. Perceptual signature is acute: Lirien notices static flecks, vine-fractals, the chip’s warmth against her sternum—never generic spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lush lyric syntax—“perpetual twilight wove shadows”—remains anchored in Elara’s tactile caretaker idiom; no register drift. Perceptual signature favors vegetal metaphors (vines, sap, scallop shells) that braid interior and world. Compression is purposeful: “vineyard hush” repeated thrice teaches the hush as liturgical silence. No dialogue, so voice coherence is total; prose rhythm breathes with climb-and-pause cadence that mirrors ascent and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature filters world through lab-worn fatigue and star-hunger. Syntax flexes from lush (“reversed waterfalls”) to clipped (“She nodded”) under trance pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction & quote-mechanic tests waive. Only micro-drift: occasional poetic pile-ons (“sycamore hush blending with rustling canopy”) risk cadence template, but rhythm breathes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person omniscient stays at monkish distance, mimicking Thren’s own self-effacement; diction (“clack-clack-clack,” “dust-choked dawn”) is filtered through his acoustical priesthood. Rhythm swells and ebbs with flock density, mirroring harmonic cadence. No head-hopping; the one moment of interior transfer is dramatized physically (pulse surging into forehead). Compression of centuries into paragraphs is purposeful elision taught by the first “endless echoes” and paid off when echoes outlive the body.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, tightening under frost-bitten duress. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for awe, staccato for strap release.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is high-register but stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon—an alien-astronomer-poet who literally reads cosmic microwave static. Rhythmic control is precise: long Latinate sentences for cosmic scale, staccato fragments (“She cast lots thrice”) for ritual beats. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Perceptual signature is distinct: she tastes time in metallic coin hum, hears nebulae in radio whine; no head-hopping or filter-verb sludge.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined: long vowel-laden sentences for dusk light, staccato noun-name bursts for the crystallizations, all filtered through a reaper’s fatalistic perceptual signature. Diction stays pre-industrial—"oculus," "plinth," "timbre"—never drifting into modern meta-talk. No dialogue means voice must carry all pressure, which it does via rhythmic escalation that mirrors light-splintering. Interior texture remains consistent even under peak grief; "distant intimacy" is maintained by addressing Lirian in second-person fragments that never collapse into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited clings to Elowen’s perceptual filter: every metaphor is sea-worn—“beggar’s promise,” “fish ghosts schooling in ether”—never academic. Rhythm flexes with stress: short staccato clauses during needle-work (“One drop, two—oil seeped”) elongate into exhausted sweep at dawn’s zenith. Internal free-indirect style stays clean: no filter-verb clusters, psychic distance tightens under fatigue without head-hop. Diction stays within a coastal mage’s lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Final bell-sentence sonically echoes opening dawn-blush, proving deliberate pattern control.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance, hovering just above Elias’s sensorium; perceptual signature is drought-narrowed and penitential—“echoed quiet,” “crunching softly,” “precisely humane.” Syntax lengthens for breath under twilight compression, then fragments slightly as photos burn: “ashes scattering.” No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“spins,” “tucks,” “whispered”). Dialogue is minimal but idiom-clean: “The waters give back what they took” carries subtext of restitution without exposition. Register stays within warden lexicon—no academic drift. No head-hopping; Mira’s interiority is implied only through Elias’s reading of her tentative hands. Rhythmic control heightens at climax without obscuring causality. A hairline slip into lyric overlap (“mirrored hush” used twice) prevents 9.0 but remains within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: she reads the flock as “living codex,” not mere birds. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then fractures into breathless clauses as steam erupts—an intentional rhythmic swell. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom alone; it does, through alchemical diction (“glacial heart,” “azure heart”) that never slips into textbook voice. The near-9.0 is clipped by one “ancient freshness” echo that feels generative rather than redundant, but still a hair repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensory pipe—only he reads the cosmic weave, feels buckle chill, hears radio rasp. Syntax compresses under pressure (“Vector shift: bear 20 degrees larboard…”) then lengthens in the arbor sigh, mirroring vigil tempo. No head-hop; Lena’s voice arrives only mediated by static and his interpretation. Diction remains within aerial-patrol register—no poetic inflation where tech precision is life.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, slightly elevated diction—“neural Collective, emissary of replicated minds”—yet stays within Kai’s post-void, hyper-lucid perceptual range. Perceptual signature sharp: he reads faces as “morphing into strangers,” feels anti-grav hum sync with heartbeat—specific, not generic. No dialogue contamination; what little speech exists carries subtext (Elara’s taunt, clone’s dual-toned gasp). Occasional stacked simile “ink in water” and “like a taunt” flirt with overwriting but arrive at high-pressure beats; pattern is taught early, so accepted. No head-hopping; single-POV stable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lean, tactile, synesthetic: “petrichor… evoking puzzle solvents.” Syntax mirrors puzzle-box mind—short clauses that pivot like combination locks. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within inventor lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks at closure: “Innovation’s silence roared triumphant” compresses oxymoron into charged poise without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice achieves a singular, spectral cadence: long vowel streams (“mournfully eager... translucent fingers”) mimic wind gusts; diction stays within Elias’s phantom lexicon. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices acoustics and corrosion, not color. Compression (“macerate the unspoken”) is taught early, paid off when gusts literally erode silence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens organically as engines crescendo. Free indirect slips once into the mother’s “ghost of a smile,” a forgivable micro-drift that still lands inside the tunnel’s collective aura.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush, feral, library-inked: “stacked infinities,” “whispering tomes,” syntax sinewy with en-dashes and compressed clauses. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent—every noticed detail is scent, texture, or spatial relation a beast would track. Rhythm swells and contracts with foggy suspense; pendant/cultist diction never breaks the spell. One hairline slip: “dimensionally homesick” dips into prompt-label cadence, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient yet anchored to Elias’s perceptual lens: “his cloak dusted with the nexus's perpetual cinders” is tactile and particular. Rhythm modulates—long, breathy clauses for brooding, then staccato verbs (“He funneled... invoked...”) at climax, mirroring pressure. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay consistent within alchemical/religious register. One register drift: “interrupt the chain!” sounds procedural, not ecclesiastical, a hairline slip that keeps the score under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices “cables groan city-wide” before moonlight aesthetics. Diction is hers—jittery waves, feed horn, power feeds—never authorial tour-guide. Rhythm accelerates with syntactic fragmentation under cable stress (“Static hushed to velvet; now the real work.”) yet never loses clarity. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets N/A; voice distinction and distance control remain airtight, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

    Third-limited stays locked to Elara with clean psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction—“reeling hush,” “veil at dusk’s edge”—creates a textured, consistent lyric register that modulates with intensity. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct: Clara’s cracked “You found it” contrasts with Elara’s measured cadence. Perceptual signature is strong—Elara notices heartbeats, mist curls, photo edges—anchoring voice in professional bias. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; rhythm mirrors breath under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited sustains tight psychic distance; diction—“crashing hush,” “phase veils”—is character-specific and rhythmic.

No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior voice remains coherent and differentiated from genre boilerplate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)

No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure, mirroring her accelerating counts. Syntax fragments at climax—code glitch echo—then steadies, dramatizing cohesion restored.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Thorne’s perceptual filter; syntax grows sinuous under pressure (“grit became gravelly bass tones”) then relaxes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory field; no head-hop. Diction is lush but botanically precise—“gravitas vine,” “ozone-tasting dew”—consistent with a cryptid researcher’s perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “fingers trembled not from cold but from fire,” “violin weeping triumph.” Rhythm compresses under statue threat—“ba-dum, ba-dum”—then elongates at release. No head-hopping; distance stable. One register drift—“mechanical blight” edges editorial—but cadence overall supports pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is a compressed courier-log, metallic and urgent: “slots gaping like unmet eyes,” “thunderstorm’s breath masking its border dash.” Syntax shortens under pressure—“Launch through the booth’s vent, unseen.” Perceptual signature is postal: every object is weighed, addressed, sorted. No head-hopping; patrol dialogue is minimal, deferential, on-point.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s carpenter gaze: noticing grain, splinters, tool weight. Syntax lengthens and softens inside the misting hush, then tightens into chisel-strokes as dawn breaks—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (“callused hands,” “wood and whimsy” hum). The lyric repetition of “whispering gleam” is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final star-chime, earning high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is dense, lyric, yet disciplined: “triangles swelled beyond Euclidean restraint” stays inside a librarian-mathematician’s lexicon.

Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, soaked in salt and aperture-light. Perceptual signature—“light teasing but never quite touching her soul’s void”—is character-particular, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric, compressed diction is pattern-taught early (“shadowed nexus under starlight”) and sustained; sentence rhythm mimics cosmic hush. POV stays tightly anchored to locksmith; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective: metallic scent, ribbon fray, star-position—never tourist catalog. Filter verbs serve voice (“he caught the signal”) rather than dull immediacy. Final whispered thanks retains cadence control under emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)

    lyrical, shard-shard syntax mirrors Elara’s fractured worldview: “dust motes danced like forgotten specters” packs perception into metaphor without filter clutter. Dialogue snaps—“Drink, boy” vs Kai’s trembling obedience—maintains status and age idiom. Backwards-walking tic is rhythmically repeated, becoming percussive signature rather than gimmick. No head-hopping; interior access stays locked to Elara with one brief, necessary external observation of Kai’s steadied hand.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays locked to Lirien’s perceptual signature: vegetal metaphors, rhythmic snips of syntax, orchard lexicon.

The lyric cadence never buckles into monotony; controlled variation under stress keeps the score high.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Free-indirect style sustains a hushed, antiquarian cadence consistent with Elias’s vocation; diction stays within connoisseur-register without drifting into catalogue-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays soldered to Elara’s scientific perceptual signature—anemones “furred,” inkwells “silted,” brine measured in densities. Syntax lengthens during analysis, fractures into staccato under pressure (“bubbles trailing like forgotten prayers”). No head-hopping; Elias remains refraction, not POV. Register drifts once—“quantum surrender”—but is earned by prior physics chatter and paid off in the globe image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is consistent artist-poet: “lute slung like faithful shadow,” “tinkersong wonder,” syntax lilting with participial music. No head-hopping; single POV held.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is meteorologist-poet: precise cloud taxonomy fused with raw grief syntax (“quietly explosive twang,” “velvet detonation”).

Patterned repetition of “strangers became family” and “reexamine” teaches its litany early and pays off in the bell-chime cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom remains consistent and purposeful. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily peeks above the fable diction, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric, textured third-person stays tightly bound to Elias’s perceptual filter: bruised dusk, fractal veins, hush-born silence. Rhythmic compression ("time’s final ripple hushed") mirrors escalating awe without losing clarity; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omni stays tight to Elaris’s synesthetic lens: “tasting the air’s metallic tang,” “flavors erupted: a mother’s grief over lost children.” Rhythmic compression under stress—“Pool by pool, he progressed”—mirrors iterative absorption. No head-hop; diction remains culinary-desert fused. One template cadence in “coral branches arched overhead, encasing ice that gleamed…” slightly flattens music, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—starlight as “borrowed,” weight “pulsing with tender vigor.” Syntax elongates during choral ascent (“English baritones joining Spanish sopranos…”) then contracts at the release (“Cheers erupted”), mirroring breath. No head-hopping; crowd voices stay external. Register stays within a librarian-poet’s lexicon; the occasional Latinate flourish (“polyphonically”) feels earned by her musical vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyric-engineer: precise diction (“microns,” “synaptic plasticity”) braided with lunar cadence. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—fragmented clauses mirror neural wildfire. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “appeared”) are minimal and voice-motivated. One template cadence echo: “Elara [verb]ed” opens four sentences in tight succession; slight drag.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lyric-accumulative voice sustains rhythmic control; syntactic parallelism (“mist coiling like forgotten thoughts… seeds of vigilance bloom… latent blaze…”) is deliberate and pattern-taught. Diction stays within archivist’s lexicon—archive, spectra, alchemical—without register drift. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; perceptual signature remains consistent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—cracks = notes, root-curl = slur—consistent with “symphonically minded” POV. Rhythm modulates: long suspensive clauses build anticipation, then fragment at climax (“Then, he began to strum.”). No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs anchor in body (“hum in bone”). Diction stays within plausible artisan-musician lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “knight’s calculated leap,” “Braille of perseverance.” Syntax mirrors chess precision—short, angular clauses under pressure. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses during the final board twist. The lyric repetition of “twilight,” “phase,” and “dent” is pattern-taught early and paid off in the resonant last line.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias sees starlight as silver filigree, hears metal as Morse code. Syntax swells into operatic cadence under pressure, matching theatrical sincerity. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; one filter-verb cluster (“he noted how the silence pulsed”) could trim.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is scent-first: “wildflower hush,” “briny shift,” “creeping sweetness laced with foreboding.” Syntax lengthens under stench-pressure, then fractures into “frantic loops,” mirroring sensory overload. Lyric elision (“tides turned fully in thought”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to Elara’s nostrils.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s pilot sensorium: “whirling silence,” “gaunt cheeks,” root-spongy footing under gloved fingers. Syntax compresses under inversion stress—“glider lurched skyward—no, downward”—mirroring vertigo. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains aviator-hydrological. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries rhythmic, wind-breath cadence that never flattens into tour-guide exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual engine—numbers, vectors, metal. Syntax tightens under pressure: “Wind howled sharper here, patterns twisting clockwise then shearing left” mirrors the very shear he tracks. No head-hopping, no filter-verb fat. The voice carries a technician’s lyricism—haze as “lens for precision”—without ever purple-ing the line. Distinctive, sustained, publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elyra’s synesthetic lens; perceptual signature is vivid (“bass clefs blooming crimson”). Rhythm swells and ebbs with bell-crescendos; diction is precise yet lyrical, never purple. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; compression (“the instant hung suspended”) is taught early and paid off at the chisel-strike climax.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is textured: syntactic parallelism (“Joy's vector traces sorrow's arcuate path”) mirrors mathematical obsession. Perceptual signature is concrete—Elias measures emotional angles in refractions. Compression is taught early (“golden facets gleamed under the ebbing night sky”) and paid off in the final flicker. No head-hopping; even Mira’s interiority is filtered through Elias’s borrowed lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains courier’s perceptual signature: wind-twitch, pendant-hum, aurora reflections in puddles—idiosyncratic, not tourist. Syntax compresses under pressure (“voice cracking like dry leaves”) then lengthens during dilation, mirroring time warp. No head-hop; Lira’s past is filtered through Kael’s vision, a slight POV stretch forgiven by lyric contract. Dialogue minimal, subtextual (“I’ll carry on” = acceptance of vocation).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is scientist-poet hybrid: “facets that caught mist like frozen prayers,” “spectrum of captive feelings,” syntax precise yet lyric. Perceptual signature sharp—Elias notices refraction angles before metaphors, frost dendrites before faces. Rhythm accelerates at climax—“Memories flooded: his childhood bike…”—then exhales into quiet final line. No dialogue, so no register mismatch; interior diction stays within lexicon of an exacting mystic-physicist.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“clack-clack hymn,” “raveling silence”) is textured and spinner-specific. Rhythm modulates: long vowel-heavy sentences stretch in wistfulness, then fracture into blurring hands under climax. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Occasional elevated phrasing—“entropy’s pull,” “conceptual repricing”—skirts register drift yet feels motived by mythic pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is perceptually distinct: velvet hush, metallic tang, verdant fire—synesthesia feels map-maker specific. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under shard-twist, longer dream-murmur cadence for folds. No head-hop; single POV stable. Free indirect style clean: "she understood" slides seamlessly from sensation to concept. Minor over-alliteration in "verdant fire...weaver eternal" but fits lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Free-indirect diction (“luminescent ache”) is consistent with a quiet man who thinks in images. Sparse dialogue is idiomatically distinct: Harlan’s rasped “Pocket that” versus Elias’s single full sentence at climax. Syntax mirrors tide-breath rhythm—long sentence for storm approach, fragment for blackout—modulating with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is textured: archaic diction, maritime cadence, storm-mirth syntax. Compression (“velvet sky,” “starlit omens”) is taught early; rhythm crests with Elias’s giggles. No POV drift; perceptual signatures—light as trap, laughter as thunder—remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is sharp, dye-master diction—“vat,” “scales,” “sun trails,” “hue shifts”—consistent throughout. Syntax breathes with sun’s crawl; paragraph lengths mirror light migration.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature: moonlight “seeped…like a balm,” corridors “labyrinthine,” dreams “pinned ephemeral wisps.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, shortens at pin-drop, mirroring breath. No dialogue; free of filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within caretaker lexicon; elevated phrases (“quantified sorrow,” “conceptual repricing”) are story concepts, not narrator intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction—“mosaic of fragmented recollections,” “bruised skin”—is character-specific and rhythmic. Compression such as “spectral friends nodded” is taught early and pays off in the final choral beat. Voice modulates from tentative hum to crescendo without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: “enlarged tranquility” is her lived sensation, not descriptor garnish. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under portal invocation. No head-hop; youth’s interior is inferred only through Elara’s empathic gaze. Diction—“nestled riddle,” “stardust”—feels intrinsic to a librarian who reads grimoires, not generic fantasy gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close adheres to Elias’s heuristic gentleness: syntax slows, verbs (“threaded,” “unwrapping”) echo cautious movement. Free-indirect slips into Mira only after she enters, flagged by exterior cue (“voice roughened”), maintaining distance control. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Mira’s city-wind rasp vs. Elias’s soft replies. No head-hopping; POV modesty observed—narrator never claims knowledge of Mira’s interior until her spoken confession. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for foraged calm, fragment (“Footsteps crunched—”) for disruption. Clean 9-band voice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s perceptual bandwidth—every adjective is a spectrographic reading. Rhythmic control mirrors procedure: long clauses for methodical setup, staccato fragments when gauge trembles. No head-hopping; voice never exceeds his lexicon. Distinct texture in “quartz hush,” “frequency at 963 hertz,” “ink freezing mid-stroke” separates this from generic fantasy diction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coastal-outlaw idiom is consistent and specific: “shine for your pa’s ghost,” “truce of hush,” “barrels at a stall draped in tattered Jolly Rogers.” Syntax mirrors Lila’s compressed urgency—elliptical fragments under the pier, lengthened cadence when she climbs the piling for oratory. Perceptual signature is runner-daughter: she notices lantern shadow angles, dice-glide acoustics, gold temperature before visual shine. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly character-bound, unreliable only in the self-mythologizing that her plan will “warn the wind,” a poise the final image undercuts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“synth-groves,” “probabilistic fields”) remains within her tech-savvy lexicon. Rhythmic control: longer coil sentences build to crest, then staccato demands at confrontation. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Filter verbs used sparingly and only when ring data is alien to her. One register wobble—“terrestrially cosmic” is ornate but repeated early, so pattern is taught.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is painterly—every glint of quartz is a potential stroke. Syntax lengthens during meticulous lock repair, then shortens at the click of success, mirroring tactile focus. No filter-verb clutter; “charcoal-fingered” replaces need for “he saw.” Voice is consistent, never drifts into editorial.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lush yet controlled third-limited diction (“colossal crystal lung,” “Braille confessions”) stays within a calligrapher’s perceptual palette. Rhythm modulates: short clauses when she wilts, longer flowing sentences inside the vault. No head-hopping; the child’s whisper is rendered as Elara hears it—external fact that saves her.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual bias: winds “etched ancient hymns,” bells “weave symphonies of truth,” diction musical rather than expository. No head-hopping; pilgrims remain externals seen through her gaze. Syntax mirrors her tuning precision—comma-rich phrases that layer like harmonics—yet avoids purple overload by anchoring every metaphor to sensory act (threading wires, drip lubrication). The seasonal return of her voice is handled with modesty: “her voice returned briefly in spring, but she preferred silence,” an inference the reader completes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight to Zeta favors techno-poetic diction—“servos straining,” “manipulator array”—with rhythmic compression; no head-hops, perceptual signature sustained under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close adheres to Elena’s selective curator-eye; perceptual signature steady. Lyric compression (“sandstorm calm,” “birdsong wove through palm fronds”) is patterned early and paid off in final hush. No head-hopping; neighbors’ voices stay external, filtered through Elena’s ear. Distinct cadence between storyteller cadence and narrative description; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical compression teaches its pattern early—“spins its web” / “lyrical code breaker”—and sustains aquatic rhythm: “bubbles trailed… phosphorescent algae… weightless ballets.” Syntax mirrors pressure: long fluid clauses under water, staccato dice rolls on slate. No head-hopping; AI voice is external, filtered through comms. Filter-verb stacks absent; diction stays within POV’s poet-engineer lexicon. Achieves 9-band clarity and texture, minus 0.1 for one stray adverb “faintly.”

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “gleaming silence” recurs as his internal metric for awe, diction never drifts into clinical or academic register. Rhythm compresses under stress—clusters of one-clause sentences when shovel strikes heart—then widens into lyrical cadence for the final embedding, mirroring cardiac rhythm without overt mimicry. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; shard-of-crystal as verb exemplifies concrete, character-bound vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical, elevated register is consistent with ritual-occult POV; patterned repetition of “tranquil blaze,” “whispered secrets,” and “smoothed hush” teaches its cadence early and pays off in the luminous final line. Syntax modulates from long sweeping sentences to fragments under pressure (“Flow accelerated.”). No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within a mystic scholar’s believable lexicon. Tiny hairline: occasional triple adjectives (“terrestrially cosmic vibrations”) flirt with excess but never break rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s acoustical bias—every noun is judged for resonance. Syntax grows shorter under meteor-lit urgency, mirroring her cardiac spike. Harlan’s dialogue carries donnish evasion (“I’ve humored your fancies”) while Elara’s probes with blunt monosyllables (“Tell me the truth”), giving clean voice distinction even in a two-hander. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is consistent—“the murmurs grew insistent,” “the building beneath them groaned in harmony.” Register never drifts into academic brochure; diction stays within a night-thought lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is saturated with Elara’s perceptual signature: enchantment-skeptic diction (“charmed skeptic,” “if only for a heartbeat”), synesthetic glow-obsession, and ritual cadence that mimics resonance waves. Rhythm accelerates with short chant-like clauses during the transfer, then exhales into longer dawn sentences. No head-hopping; the garden’s sentient response is filtered through her wondering gaze. Compression is taught early (“petals unfurled like shadowed cloaks”) and paid off when petals reform at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly anchored to Elias’s perceptual filter: calligraphic motion, ink-blood synesthesia, drip-counted time. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual breath; no head-hop. Diction stays within a craftsman’s lexicon—“calibrated,” “reservoir,” “counter-strokes”—without academic drift. One cadence hiccup: triple “calibrated” reuse across two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elyra’s synesthetic ear: “universe hummed its secret song” is her perceptual register, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens and contracts with disclosure rhythm, mirroring breath control of canyon song. No head-hopping; oracle, merchant, guardian remain opaque in motive, read only through Elyra’s sensory bias. Compressed lyric diction is pattern-taught early and paid off at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited keeps psychic distance steady; perceptual signature favors chill, glassy, star-metaphors consistent with glacier night. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for ritual invocation, clipped fragments at “snarling defiance.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction “viscous pool,” “thread by thread” shows control; elevated phrasing stays consonant with ceremonial POV. No head-hop; filter verbs serve lyricism, not hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature—“stormlit,” “gritty lullaby,” “illicit hunger”—syntax grows clipped under intensity. No head-hopping; Mira’s betrayal is read only through Elias’s glimpse of “eyes flickering.” Patterned lyric elision (“days blurred into weeks”) is taught early and paid off in final cadence. Voice modulation between whimsical grandeur and scavenger grit is consistent, earning 9-territory; minor 0.3 reserve because the closing line’s pyre/dawn couplet edges toward aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric close-distance stays stable; perceptual signature is sound-centric, thrift-store diction, rhythmic cadence mirroring wave/metronome. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature: Elias notices ice like “awakening leviathans,” light in “shimmering veins”—professional engineer’s sensory hierarchy. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during sprint, breathes in final sentence. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bound. Filter verbs minimal; “tasted of salt and spectral desire” shows controlled elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight sustains flint-sharp perceptual signature; syntax glides from compressed procedural (“skates whispering”) to wind-claw tactile peaks. No head-hop; lunar math diction stays within mapper’s lexicon. One register bump: “conceptual repricing” moment veers academic; else excellent rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is forensic, clipped, yet lyrically charged—“fortified vulnerability” is repeated but earned as armor that wounds. Syntax tightens under vibration peaks; fragments mimic train-throb. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature distinct: she sees everything as evidence first, ghost second.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—dust motes as “silent fireflies,” gears “whispering.” Syntax lengthens under emotion, then contracts at the click of revival, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Harrow’s dialogue is spare, distinct from Elias’s more ornate internal cadence. Filter verbs (“Elias watched”) are minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is brass-acid-steam textured: “gnawed,” “gossiping steam,” “smug talisman.” Syntax shortens under pressure—“Days blurred”—then elongates in sky-ascension cadence. No dialogue, so subtext carried in glyph-whispers and gear-hum. Diction stays within tinker-inventor lexicon; no filter-verb leakage. Kaleidoscope pattern taught early and paid off in final “infinite kaleidoscopic turns.”

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.7)
    Corporate-archive diction is consistent and selective (“sensed absence,” “corporate purgatory”) with syntactic compression under pressure; no dialogue to test, but perceptual signature stays sharp—Elara notices pixel glitches and thread texture first.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person omniscient maintains stable distance, filtering perceptions through Thorne’s shadow-sensed lexicon (“smoke given form,” “shadows lacing”). Lyric compression is taught early (“lighthouse rays tangled with encroaching darkness”) and paid off in rhythmic pulse-lines matching beacon sweeps. No head-hopping; dryad and wraith voices surface only via Thorne-interpreted glimpses, keeping focalization clean. Some elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “holographic map”) momentarily lifts above noir-poetic register but remains consistent enough to avoid register drift penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Liora’s hypothermic perception: “gripped reality loosely,” “windborne solace,” syntactic compression mimics narcosis. Diction stays within her dazed lexicon; no elevated register drift. Perceptual signature—sound over sight, cold as moral fact—remains consistent. Dialogue sparse, natural: Tomas’s “Endings don’t rush here” carries subtext of mutual suicide pact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at Elena’s shoulder yet borrows Theo’s vineyard idiom: “lovers’ quarrel,” “vineyard sentinel,” “tamed wild seasons.” Syntax lengthens with vine-like clauses under calm, then shortens at dawn release. No head-hopping; Theo’s past is delivered in dialogue, not interior leap. Perceptual signature is consistent: city architect’s “rigid lines” versus vines’ “organic curves” stays Elena’s metaphor system.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, oracular, yet internally consistent: long breathed sentences mimic pavilion murmurs, while curt declarations (“This parapet resists all but sidelong truth”) puncture the hush precisely. Diction stays within the walker’s ritual lexicon; no filter verbs dull the immediacy. Compression is purposeful—“conjured clearings dissolving like mist”—and the pattern is taught by line 3, repaid in closure. Minor risk of incantatory monotony, but rhythmic control heightens rather than obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct lyric-accumulative voice—repetition of “arc(s)” builds pattern, cadence modulates with twilight hush; perceptual signature is curator-visual (edges curled like ancient petals) without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue to test, free-indirect stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elowen’s perceptual filter: “weathered innocence,” “creased lids,” “ghost in that profound quiet.” Syntax stretches into lyric catalog only when the crystal releases its torrent, matching her sensory overwhelm. No head-hop; diction remains within her scholarly yet childlike lexicon. The final smile is rendered externally, preserving reticent distance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is prophet-mystic without pastiche: diction of “susurrus,” “marrow,” “sigils” feels native to a man who scries in rust. Syntax elongates then fractures—long sentences for fog-drifts, stubbed fragments for forgotten visions. Perceptual signature is metallurgic-poetic: he tastes metal in fog, hears spindles hum like bones. No dialogue, so single-POV coherence is absolute; unreliability is dramatized (hears decay, forgets prophecy) rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: compressed cosmic metaphors (“hypnotic vortex of escape velocity”) sit beside tactile tool action, reflecting an astro-technician’s awe. Rhythm accelerates during quake then breathes during leaf-listen calibration. No head-hopping; free indirect is clean (“He positioned his ear…”). Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon; no corporate spill-over. Purposeful elision (no dialogue) is coherent under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “pulsing stillness,” “golden threads,” syntax breathes with therapeutic cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction stays consistent, Anglican-with-poetry. Patterned repetition (“hymned the mundane”) is taught early and paid off. Minor risk of lit-fic glaze, but rhythmic control justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s selective gaze; perceptual signature is tactile-mineral (“star-ink,” “filigreed bronze”). Syntax lengthens during ink-work, shortens at key-turn—rhythm breathes with action. No dialogue, so requirement waived; internal diction credible for scholar (“ley-nexus,” “umbral gardens”) without drifting into encyclopedia.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: medical lexis (“setting,” “linen strips,” “vervain”) colors every perception. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under procedure; rhythm mirrors bone-setting torque. No dialogue, so voice carries full load and remains idiosyncratic. “Shrewdly innocent” and “nostalgic riot” are risky collocations, but pattern is taught early and paid off at pearl fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“zephyr of celestial petals,” “salt-kissed gift”—diction never exceeds her star-watcher lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with polishing strokes, then exhales at dawn reveal; no template cadence. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely through narrative texture, which is consistent and distinctive. Patterned repetition (“memories resurfaced”) is taught early and paid off in final line, justifying lyric returns.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Free-indirect texture is consistent: “she studied one such pattern… invitation in subtle curls” stays inside Elara’s coder-perceiver mind. Rhythmic control under pressure: short declaratives at transfer (“Take it”) echo code commands. Dialogue carries subtext: Kai’s “like code from a forgotten drive” reveals identity without exposition. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance, filtered through Elias’s synesthetic attention (“swirling hush,” “lucidly watchful”). Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic breathless ritual momentum. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction and metaphor; occasional purple tinge (“solemnizing her essence”) is voice-motivated. Patterned elision—“solemnize” used four times—teaches ritual cadence and pays off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Lir’s sensorium: “veins bulging like roots seeking water” is character-particular, not generic. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under stress; diction remains within plausible alchemist lexicon. Minor over-decoration in “emerald loops” and “departing spirits” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person hovers at a reflective distance that mirrors Elias’s sidelong gaze: syntax elongates then snaps short at each gear-click, rhythm tracking the tension between study and seizure. Lexicon stays artisanal—tumblers, filaments, hair-springs—never drifting into poetic inflation. The voice is singular, stable, and teaches its pattern early; the final replayed echoes repay the taught cadence with chilling exactitude.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice distinct: “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie” create singular texture. Syntax elongates then fractures under recursion, mirroring content. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays filtered through Elara’s metallic, mathematical sensorium. Register stable, no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited voice is steady, syntactically controlled, with engineer’s perceptual filter (“stress fractures whispered”). No head-hop; psychic distance stable. One register slip: “proto-AI designed to guide ships” sounds encyclopedic amid her idiom. Otherwise rhythm breathes with action, final sentence lands in cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves a perceptual signature: clauses glide like sliding gears—“excruciatingly gentle” repeats with mechanical exactitude, teaching the reader to move slowly. Diction stays within a cloistered artisan’s lexicon; no corporate register intrudes. Syntax lengthens and softens during the whisper sequence, then contracts as Elias stands, mirroring emotional unclenching. No dialogue, so voice convergence is N/A; interior texture remains singular and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature—“ripple-reading,” “architecture of lies.” Rhythmic control mirrors twilight calm vs. internal upheaval: long cadences drift, then snap short at inscription. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded. Filter verbs (“he sensed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Elias’s collector perception; diction of “salt-crusted pods,” “barnacled pilings” is specific and unliterary. Rhythm lengthens during decoding, then shortens at the pact, mirroring patience crystallizing into duty. Kael’s dialect (“won’t yield its grip”) is restrained, distinct without caricature. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-ornate yet stays within a traveler-philosopher’s plausible lexicon; syntax elongates then compresses to mimic tidal breathing. Perceptual signature is color-obsessed: bruised purple, molten amber, gold and rust—Elias sees in dyes and decay. No head-hop; internal access remains strictly anchored. Compression like “salt-wind cartography” teaches the reader to accept noun-stacking that pays off in final “path of gold.”

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is dense, rhythmic, compulsive—syntax piles clauses like scavenged fragments, mirroring Elarion’s fevered mind. Lexicon stays inside his diction: “reptilian regret,” “thundercloud veins” feel learned from palace rubble, not thesaurus churn. Patterned repetition of “quaked/hypothesized” is taught early and paid off in the final quake-flash. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; single POV remains locked. Only hairline slip: occasional elevated Latinate adjectives (“opalescent”) momentarily lift register above the skeletal prince’s idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Lira’s fire-sharper perception: “senses attuned to the subtlest shift in wind or warmth.” Syntax lengthens and softens during kelp idyll, then compresses for the graft cut, mirroring respiration. No head-hop; coined foreignness stays object-bound. Voice avoids pyrotechnics yet accumulates a hush unique to post-fire lagoons—distinctive enough for 9-band but for one cliché cluster (“silenced screams”).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence of heavy caesura and luminous compound phrases (“bruised autumn sky…captured starlight”). Perceptual signature is cosmological rather than psychological, fitting an accumulative design. No dialogue, so no register clash; syntax stays within poetic latitude. Filter-verb count is low; immediacy survives the adjective load because each modifier is tethered to star or water imagery, reinforcing pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric, nebula-poetic register is stable: compressed diction “petal-sigh detritus,” sonic patterning “ping—echo,” synesthetic “whispered memories” create a distinct texture. Perceptual signature is Elowen’s: starlight-veil body notices light-capture, kin-unraveling, maternal echoes. No head-hopping; single POV maintained. Filter verbs (“felt,” “watched”) are voice-motivated, mimicking sonar feedback rhythm. Dialogue absent, so voice evaluation is solely on narrative texture—passes read-aloud ear test without drumbeat pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV hovers at a calibrated distance that can slip inside Elias’s bones—“vibrated deep in his bones”—yet pull wide to watch specters merge with swarm. Perceptual signature is gravestone-carver precise: light is “fractured,” tears “carve,” and every poem is a tool. No head-hopping; specters remain translucent chorus, their dialogue distilled to single poetic lines that echo Elias’s interior cadence. Compression is purposeful: “thundering calm” is an oxymoron taught early and paid off in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s sinewy, salt-stung perception; no head-hop. Diction—“tidal obsidian ridge,” “gears whispering secrets”—is elevated yet consistent with a man who has spent thirty years naming mechanical parts. Rhythm mirrors surf: long swells of cadence, then clipped fragments at the pause (“eternal heartbeat”). Free indirect slips in cleanly: “His precision was legend” reads as village gossip he’s overheard, not authorial exposition. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy intact. Voice distinctiveness is high, just shy of 9+ because the lyric swell occasionally over-decorates (“searing reverie” twice) without fresh sensory twist.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s gardener perception; diction of “petals,” “thorny vines,” and “silo slits” is occupational and rhythmic. Velveteen gloom motif recurs with slight modulation, pattern taught early and paid off in final silence. No dialogue, so no voice-drift; free indirect syntax remains consistent, compressing under starlit hush without fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction—“obsidian spire,” “groundedly imaginative defiance”—is character-appropriate cartographer lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for calculation, fragments under threat (“Heart pounding”). No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs serve voice (“Elias sensed the spire humming”) rather than dull immediacy. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact—he cannot know enforcers’ exact thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric, rhythmic prose mirrors score notation; syntax lengthens and compresses like orchestral phrases. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices acoustic texture (radio hum, quill scratch) over visual minutiae. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked in her precise, metronomic attention.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a hypnotic cadence that mirrors the gallery’s optical tricks (“echoes softened, cradling shadows of the departed”). Diction stays within the somber-marvel register; no academic leakage. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“he knew better” is a necessary intrusion). The single POV never leaks; perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices edges, fractures, recessions—exactly what a man who makes false wholes would see.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: philosopher-wannabe filters world through chronometry metaphors, nautical almanac diction, and abrasive calm tone. Syntax tightens under pressure—“He excavated frantically yet calmly” compresses contradiction into one clause. No head-hopping; POV distance stays locked inside Elias’s salt-stung senses. Purposeful repetition of “abrasive calm” teaches pattern and pays off when the phrase is carved into metal, confirming voice as plot engine.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s contemplative diction; syntax lengthens to mimic stillness, then contracts at closure. No head-hopping; choral voices remain external. Register remains elevated but consistent with Elara’s vocation. Occasional poetic compression (“velvet hush”) is pattern-taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lingers close to Elias’s synesthetic lens: verbs like “taste,” “hum,” “unfurl” keep perception gustatory and tactile. Syntax loosens only in the aphoristic stew-line, which fits his informally wise persona. No dialogue, so voice convergence is moot. Occasional elevated diction (“synaptic plasticity”) momentarily lifts POV distance, but rhythm recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias without head-hopping; perceptual signature is thick with synesthetic nectar imagery and toll-booth idioms. Syntax mirrors his constrained voice—short, declarative bursts when curse bites, longer riddle cadence when wonder is invoked. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven: Mira’s demands, Elias’s involuntary truth, both carrying subtext of need vs. fatigue. No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens perceptibly during the box hand-off.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrically compressed with patterned elision—“streetlights daydreamed,” “shard of hush”—taught early and paid off in the final “hushed blaze.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices slow fade, ivy creep, violet scent with connoisseur precision. No dialogue to distort register; free-indirect style stays clean. Rhythm modulates from languid observation to incantatory listing of objects, mirroring the shift from noticing to making.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV clings tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter: “bubbles erupting from her gills” is body-specific, not generic. Thalor’s telepathic idiom is distinct—voice “threads like silk,” “gentle scalpel”—creating a perceptual signature separate from Elara’s grittier physicality. No head-hopping; even the visions are framed as Thalor “projecting” into her mind. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses underwater, then clipped beats as the ampoule cracks, mirroring pulse under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; diction fuses mathematical register with bleak lyricism—“equations looping infinitely, derivatives chasing tails.” Perceptual signature filters cosmos through proof obsession: staircase = phase-space. No dialogue, so voice rests on syntactic control: varied sentence rhythm accelerates with proof rush, slows at rupture. One micro slippage: “wind’s kiss” edges romantic, but POV’s memory licenses it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays painterly-tight: “saffron quiet,” “waxing moon’s glow,” “daydreams cascaded” are idiosyncratic to Elias’s chromatic insomnia. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences during visions to a clipped final “He curled among the pots,” mirroring his retreat into sleep. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains fixed on color, light, brush-weight. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are minimal and voice-motivated, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s sensorium: perception skewed through emerald tint, smell of rosewater turned toxin. Syntax swells and contracts with water pressure—long clauses pre-flood, staccato verbs at shatter. No head-hop; collective “they” remains anchored in her orchestration. Diction stays within grotto lexicon—no stray tech or modern slang.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is compressed, lyric, mechanically precise—“neatly inventive” as self-descriptor. Syntax mirrors the subject: long sentences wind, then snap (“with a snap”). Diction stays inside Elias’s gear-lexicon without strain. One 0.2 ding: “bleak exhilaration” is named rather than felt; otherwise tone modulates from chill wind to hollow laughter under escalating drain.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“unbosoming,” “bioluminescent slime”) stays inside Elara’s operatic dread register. Rhythm flexes—long clauses for woozy mirrors, staccato for confession beats. No head-hop; advisor’s voice is reported temptation, not quoted, preserving POV chastity. Final whispered line to herself keeps perceptual signature consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Elowen’s perceptual filter: salt-rimed tattoos, cloud-vortices as “ink spilled.” Syntax grows staccato under peak pressure (“mallet blurring in fractal frenzy”), then exhales. No head-hopping; diction remains within maritime-mystic lexicon. Distinct rhythmic signature sustains throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays anchored in Elara’s perceptions; sensory diction—“molten gold,” “phosphorescent brine”—reads like her trained cartographer precision. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal cadence modulates under stress, with short bursts mirroring whistle code.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person tight maintains historian’s cataloguing diction: “rational thrill,” “conceptual repricing,” lexical choices apt to academic mind. Rhythm accelerates inside tunnel—short clauses mimic heartbeat under torch glare. No dialogue, so voice carries via perception filter; perceptual signature consistent. One register drift: “history’s honest pulse” edges platitude, but saved by final concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual bias—salt-burn, kelp-shadow, brass gleam. Syntax lengthens underwater, shortens when he surfaces, mirroring breath. No head-hop; the distant diver years later is framed as rumor Elias hears, keeping psychic distance clean. One clause—“heart ablaze in hushed intensity”—edges toward poetic overreach, but the surrounding physicality grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric, ornate, yet internally consistent—“luminous torment,” “radiant agony”—taught by first paragraph and paid off in the sparkle swarm. Syntax lengthens under grief-load, then shortens at each crisp crease, mirroring emotional compression. No head-hops; perceptual signature is Elar’s artisan-eye noticing facets, veins, dew. Register stays elevated but plausible for a crafter who speaks in light.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: Elara notices vacuum troughs, shrapnel itch, thrumming coils—never neutral exposition. Rhythms tighten under pressure—fragments like “phasing through mist-made stone” compress sensation. No head-hop; AI voice is external tool, not focalizer. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she names perturbation theory because she literally uses it, not author showing off.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV clings tightly to Elara’s perceptual signature—“sharp eyes,” “pulse quickened,” “drone remote humming”—with clean psychic distance. Syntax mirrors pressure: short kernel sentences during lever pull, then elongated clauses as tone floods. No head-hop. Diction stays within her tech-pilot lexicon; “type foundry matrix chip” is jargon she would know. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic. Final image of “observatory whispered secrets” is a permissible poetic lift that reprises the opening mood.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited sustains a melancholic, salt-stained diction—“salt spray,” “jagged rocks,” “sieved hush”—that is consistent and character-specific. Sentence rhythm mirrors surf: long swells of clause, then abrupt fragments (“He pocketed the watch hand”). No head-hopping; perception stays Elias-bound. Minor tic: two uses of “tempered regret” verge on motif-announcement, but voice remains distinct enough to survive them.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical third-person limited sustains mythic cadence without purple drift. Perceptual signature filters world through metallic relic, moonlight, rope texture. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic (“The moon aligns; we proceed”), distinct from narrative sweep. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under peak wind but stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s salt-rough lexicon; no head-hop. Rhythm mimics paddle cadence—long sentences for glide, fragments for slap-swells. “Merrily melancholic” repetition is a conscious tic that pays off when the laugh turns to tears at the end. No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate: “tasting brine and folly.”

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Jax’s perceptual signature is consistent: jaded wonder colors every noticing—“delicately robust,” “veins of light.” Syntax compresses under descent pressure; fragments mirror tunnel breath.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains lush, moonlit cadence without drumbeat monotony. Diction stays within fairy-tale register; phoenix, unicorns, nebulae handled without ironic distancing. Compression in peak beats (“bones reshaping into a majestic form”) keeps momentum. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Occasional filter verbs (“she understood their murmurs”) slightly dull immediacy but do not metastasize.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet controlled: “bloated the sky like a bruised lung” is POV-bound perception of exhausted post-partum body. Rhythm modulates—long clause swell mirrors vaporous intake, then short staccato “She wound the mechanism” mimics tick. No head-hopping; infant gaze is externalized through Lirien’s interpretive lens. Diction stays within cartomancer’s lexicon: “onyx-ink,” “accumulating veil,” “queen of clouds”—esoteric but consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is holographic-poetic: syntax lengthens with filament imagery, then fragments under rage’s “spectral fireflies.” Diction stays within salvaged-code lexicon—no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic control—“vibrant hush,” “fireflowers”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices light, texture, pulses. Diction stays within plausible diction for a humble villager turned mystic; no filter-verb clusters. Experimental compression (phrases like “slow dance”) is taught early and paid off. Minor echo of “whispering hush” but reads as intentional motif; no voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—slant of light, click of bronze, ciphered angles.

Syntax mirrors slipperiness—long liquid sentences that coast, then tighten into staccato rock counts. No head-hopping; diction (“tetrahedral harmony,” “Sierpinski proxy”) stays within his pattern-obsessed lexicon. Voice modulates: lyrical opening compresses into urgent ritual cadence at peak, then exhaled release—rhythmic control heightens pressure without ever obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: stormlight as “veins of forgotten gods,” timetable pages “yellowed like protest parchments.” Syntax rarefies under pressure—fragmented clauses mirror lightning staccato. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds a poet’s lexicon; register stable.</question>
    <question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>High information density: “timer hit thirty minutes, pausing his vigil like a breath held too long” does triple duty (clock, body, tension). Figurative language is patterned, not stacked—storm-metaphor domain is taught early and paid off. One loop risk: “storm-kissed wonder” recurs four times; slight rhythmic fatigue, but it recharges in the final image, so closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close maintains tight psychic leash on Voss; perceptual signature—“gears whirring like unspoken retorts”—is character-specific. Elevated diction (“prismatic chaos,” “diplomatically fierce”) risks register drift but feels idiosyncratic to philosopher-duelist persona. No head-hopping; Lang observed only through Voss’s angled gaze. Rhythm accelerates with clause-fragments during blade clinches, mirroring metallic staccato; pattern taught early, paid off at shatter-pane climax.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Compressed lyric diction (“luminous fracture of gravel and melody”) stays inside a poet-narrator’s lexicon; syntax swells and contracts with moonlight phases. No head-hops; POV keeps to Elias’s perceptual filter—Mira is observed externally until dialogue allows her glass-sharp eyes to reflect stars. Rhythmic control peaks at “patting soil pilfered from the exercise pen,” where monosyllables mimic stealth. Minor tic: “molting” metaphor repeats but its pattern is taught early and pays off, so the echo reads intentional, not monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—“needles twitching erratically” = his distrust of direction.

Diction stays within ivory-tickler lexicon—“ivories,” “impromptu serenade,” “score.”

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: calibrated, instrument-filtered diction (“petrichor promise,” “echo-mirrors that quantified the unquantifiable”).

Register stays within Elara’s empirical-whimsical idiom; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is salt-sting synesthesia and maritime lexicon (“spectral galleon,” “slack tide”) unique to Elara’s ex-sailor subconscious. Syntax breathes with prunes and tides—long clauses mirror swell, then snap short on cut. Hiroshi’s slow-spoken diction is distinguishable by root-earth metaphors versus her wave-depth idiom. No head-hopping; compression in “cerulean regret pooling” is taught by earlier sky-bruise image and paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtered through Elias’s artist-monk sensibility. Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical in description (“foggy lucidity”), urgent in action (“Breathe with the projection”).

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrically controlled, with rhythmic variation mirroring tension (short clauses during disruption, flowing syntax in revelation). Perceptual signature is strong: Elias notices musical and spatial details (staves, grates, chains) fitting his profession. Consistent third-person limited POV with no leakage. Minor deduction: “unstruck chords hanging like threats” slightly overreaches metaphorically, bordering on abstraction in an otherwise concrete narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)

No head-hopping; first-person interiority stays bounded by plausible knowledge. Elevated diction (“luminous disbelief,” “collodion in fixer”) feels voice-motivated, not intrusive, and the lyric compression pays off in the scaffold-as-applause closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic cadence mirroring dusk’s “harmonious” pulse. Diction remains within Elias’s plausible lexicon—no register drift—though “perceptively calm” borders on diagnostic label-speak. POV is stable single-third, with selective attention to currency textures and light. No dialogue flaws, but repetition of key phrases (“dusky harmony,” “polished calm”) risks template cadence; still, perceptual signature holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, primarily Thorne’s, with seamless dips into Lyra’s state via observable cues. Voice has distinct texture: lyrical but precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“variable stars bloomed in his mind’s eye”). Minor register drift in peak beats (“healed with words” borders on abstract), but diction stays character-bound. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters cosmos through chronicler’s obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in druidic lexicon (“enchanted mirror,” “flesh-eating plant seed”) and rhythmic modulation—longer sentences for serenity, staccato beats during pain (“Pain sharpened his focus”). Voice remains consistent under stress; no head-hopping or register drift. The prose-as-character principle holds: syntax thickens with the orchard’s density, then clears at dawn. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“warlike serenity”) repeated, though purposefully reweighted in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“cities of glass floating early, skies raining forgotten tomorrows”). Perceptual signature filters all through Elara’s root-bound sensorium—she notices veins, scars, sap, not abstract concepts. No head-hopping; tense and distance remain stable. Minor flaw: slight register drift in “quantum rifts tearing tomorrow into today”—slightly expository—but quickly grounded in bodily sensation (“legs fused into gnarled roots”).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices phosphorescent fungi as “forgotten prayers,” roots as “veins through marble.” Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during incantation, lyrical flow in reflection—without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: roadie-meets-appraiser diction (“wrested,” “grit fused with precision”) modulates under pressure, compressing into shorter phrases during climax. POV remains tightly controlled, with perceptual bias filtering details (noticing weave density before emotion). Repetition of “confidently uncertain” and “wrest” is pattern-taught early and paid off, avoiding scaffold. Minor register drift in “emotion fueled the next verse” slightly breaches voice consistency at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices magnetic flux lines, clay textures, and quantum parallels with translator’s precision. Syntax modulates—longer sentences for reflection, fragments for crisis (“Thunder rumbled… arbor shuddered”). Voice remains consistently lyrical yet grounded; no head-hopping or register drift. Pilgrims’ dialogue (“eyes wide”) contrasts Elias’s measured analogies, enhancing his solitude-turned-communion without voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“gears meshing in serene rhythm,” “wintersun on frost”). POV remains tightly focalized through an omniscient narrator aligned with the librarian’s perspective, avoiding head-hopping. Diction modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the chase, flowing syntax at resolution. Elision is purposeful (no backstory dumps), and the perceptual signature favors mechanical-poetic hybrids (“steam sighing,” “ticking echoes”).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, silence, and loss (“footfall echoed like a distant sigh”).

No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is tightly focalized through Elias’s chronicler sensibility: syntax modulates from precise (“quadrant-by-quadrant search”) to lyrical (“ivy tendrils seeming to sway in quiet approval”) without register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—everything is mapped, measured, or musically rendered. No dialogue, so no contamination; free indirect thought blends seamlessly with action. Compression is purposeful, and the recurring “daringly methodical” refrain evolves from descriptor to ethos without head-hopping or exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to veils, mists, and delayed signals. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during decoding (“three beats… seven for the next”), flowing rhythms in discovery. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or omniscience. The prose trusts implication—e.g., “tears pricked her eyes beneath the veil” conveys emotion without label—and maintains register consistency even in elevated moments.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures (velvet, ice, saucer-cracked porcelain) and reads futures in stains. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during urgency (“*Propagate,* the ivy insisted”). Free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“bitter mulberry ache bloomed in her chest”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction occasionally veers ornate (“potent allure,” “verdant whispers”), but pattern is taught early and pays off in the resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is exquisitely calibrated to Lirien’s lucid watchfulness: syntax sharpens under pressure (“Breathe steady, she sifted chaos”), rhythm mirrors auroral pulses, and diction blends occupational lexicon (“mortician’s elixir,” “phosphor bloom”) with poetic precision. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or omniscience. Prose modulates from lyrical description to staccato urgency without register drift. The perceptual signature—filtering world through pattern-recognition—feels character-specific and consistent even at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that breathes during reflection (“vineyard hush”) and sharpens during action (“scallop: with delicate strokes”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices botanical and textural details (gnarled trees, filigreed silver) filtered through caretaker identity. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Elevated diction (“umbral,” “scallop”) fits her lexicon, though near the end, “ancestral whispers stirred” slightly edges toward abstraction without immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Alex’s perceptual bias (“sincerely insincere” repeated as his judgment of Elias). Voice modulates with intensity: short clauses during protest (“But my certainty—he stole everything!”), lyrical cadence in reflection. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no academic intrusions. The only slip: Elias’s dialogue occasionally veers into aphoristic artifice (“Certainty is the thief”), but this aligns with his role as “conscience for hire,” making the register drift intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices light, texture, and sound through scientific longing (“skin tightening with premature lines”).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled: rhythmic, lyric, and steeped in Thren’s perceptual signature (“dust-choked dawn,” “echoes replayed the sighs of long-dead winds”). Syntax varies purposefully—short staccato beats during throws, flowing cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored in sensory immediacy. Elevated diction (“harmonic stone skimmer,” “bruised sky”) fits the mythic register without drifting from Thren’s reverent lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Thorne notices frost-etched stairs like garden paths, hears winds as “automated elegies,” feels luminance as “persistent warmth.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences early; clipped focus during unstrapping (“The first strap fell away”). Free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“spells fizzled... like damp sparks”). Voice remains consistent, poetic but never academic, anchored in mage-as-craftsman lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during naming (“Krathor,” she named it”), lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; even Lirian’s voice is filtered as echo, not intrusion. Minor register drift in “ethereal hues” and “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing costs 0.2, but overall voice remains distinct and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable single-third with distinct perceptual signature: Elowen notices rhythmic patterns, sapphire hues, and ritual details per his maritime upbringing. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during repair crisis (“One drop, two—oil seeped”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“brittle intensity,” “lukewarm cantrip-flame”). No head-hopping; prose rhythm mirrors drip cadence, teaching pattern early and paying off at closure with “steady as pre-fish eras.”

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s precise, warden-trained perception (“boots crunching softly on gravel that echoed the quiet”). Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences in reflection, fragmented urgency at climax (“Guilt had driven him...”). Diction stays within his lexicon—no academic intrusions—and Mira’s silent presence avoids voice contamination. The prose itself enacts “precisely humane” control, especially in the lantern-flame closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyrically distinct with a perceptual signature: Elara notices light refraction, chemical scents, and geometric patterns first, reflecting her alchemist’s mind. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, flowing sentences during observation; tighter phrasing during ritual acts (“She lit... coaxing vaporous tendrils”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“kaleidoscopic,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied but never stated), and rhythm accelerates toward the starlings’ convergence without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with syntax that mirrors Elias’s hyper-attentive state (“soundless echo of the windless night amplified every faint creak”).

Dialogue feels natural, goal-driven, and voice-distinct from narration.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Kai’s numb perception—world details warp with timelines, Blade hum syncs with anti-grav. Voice modulates under pressure: short clauses during combat (“Pretense shattered”), lyrical flow at climax (“neurons firing in symphonic fury”). Elara’s dialogue carries Collective dogma (“obsolete husks”) distinct from Kai’s terse resolve. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (numbness as clarity) sustains rhythm without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: Elias’s perceptual signature blends botany, puzzle logic, and lyrical observation (“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal paths”). Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter clauses during decoding, flowing cadence at rest. POV is stable, with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. Elevated diction (“petrichor,” “titan arum”) fits his expertise, though “orthogonal” risks overuse as jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is singular and immersive: syntax mirrors feral lucidity (“claws dug,” “growl escaped”) while diction blends poetic precision (“foggy lucidity,” “stacked infinities”) with embodied urgency. POV remains tightly focalized; even memories are cued by present stimuli (pendant’s pulse). No head-hopping, no register drift—elevated phrasing feels native to this dimensionally displaced guardian. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the portal’s yawn.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: alchemical lexicon (“vivify,” “ember essence”) fused with poetic compression (“petals trapped in eternal winter”). POV remains tightly focalized; perception narrows under stress (e.g., breath fogging air during pause).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices geometry, texture, and optical deceit first. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during weaving (“He knotted the final pattern...”), then expands post-eruption. Diction stays within architect lexicon (“lattice,” “fractals”) without register drift. No head-hopping; all reflection is anchored to present stimuli (e.g., touching illusory flesh triggers memory shifts).

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s balanced perspective, with perceptual signature evident in how she notices “jagged edges” and “bioluminescent glow.” Voice modulates rhythmically—from measured exposition to somber hymn—and diction stays within plausible lexicon (“dihedral angles,” not jargon overload). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Kai’s line reveals urgency without exposition. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in “somber marvel” phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature (“contact tracer for hearts,” noticing emotional residue). Voice modulates with pressure—lyric in description (“shadows pooling like forgotten sighs”), taut in action (“Elara moved quietly”). No head-hopping; Clara’s interiority is inferred through behavior. Diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon, avoiding register drift even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)

Voice modulates rhythm under pressure: short, staccato clauses during constriction (“Heart hammering. Belly to stone.”) versus lyrical flow in revelation (“pages whispering like distant surf”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Minor deduction for slightly elevated phrasing (“resonant hush”) in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices patterns (veins, fractals, spirals) as maps of inner fracture. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, staccato beats during counting (“fifty-two, fifty-three”)—mirroring her state. Diction remains within plausible lexicon (no academic intrusions), and free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“she sought midnight solace here”). The only flaw: minor register drift in “residual energies” and “quantum archive,” which feel slightly expository but don’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is inseparable from Thorne’s perceptual signature: noticing thermal spirals as “scripted air,” hearing echoes as “labyrinthine choirs.” Syntax modulates—long, mist-like sentences early; staccato phrases during ritual (“Grit became gravelly bass tones”). Copper-veined POV stays strict; no head-hopping. Diction (“zhar’keth,” “syl’vren”) feels lived, not lexicon-dumped. Even elevated prose (“rib of leviathans”) stays within storyteller’s mythic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elara’s cryptid-researcher lexicon (“sylvan whimsy,” “gravitas vine”). Voice modulates rhythmically—from dense, lyrical description in stillness to staccato urgency during the phone call. Dialogue from the returned is fragmented and idiosyncratic, avoiding exposition.

Voice modulates rhythmically: longer, lyrical sentences in stillness; tighter phrasing during action (“Gently, he pried it free”). Diction remains within a carpenter-poet’s lexicon—no register drift. The prose sings without overwriting; elision (no dialogue, no backstory dump) serves the accumulative texture. Final line echoes the opening “whispering gleam,” closing the perceptual loop.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Eliza’s perceptual signature: she sees poetry in saddle-shaped metrics, hears whispers in frayed silk. Voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the tremor (“colors bloomed faintly… threads vibrating as if alive”) and breathes in solitude. Syntax mirrors hyperbolic unfolding: long, curving sentences give way to sharp fragments (“A patron coughed softly nearby”). No head-hopping; even patrons remain spectral presences observed through Eliza’s lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices ink “twisting like waves evading shore,” light as “searching fingers.” Syntax modulates—long, lyrical sentences for ritual; clipped urgency during exposure adjustments. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping. Register stays consistent (elevated but character-apt), though “luminous absence” risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited through Elara, with perceptual signature evident in glass/mirror metaphors and archival lexicon (“annotate,” “geometry”). Voice modulates under stress—sentences shorten during Kai’s sigil-tracing, yet retain lyrical texture (“resilience blooming under her combative wing”). Dialogue distinguishes characters: Elara’s barbed terseness vs. Kai’s hesitant queries. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent, deepening only where Elara’s past surfaces via concrete cues (shattered mirrors).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent in third-person limited aligned with Lirien’s sensibility—syntax mirrors pruning (“fingers dancing like shears”), diction rooted in horticulture and light. No head-hopping; Elowen’s perspective is observed, not entered. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (“colors lost,” “nights without dreams”). However, prose occasionally slips into elevated abstraction (“radiant hush,” “essence preserved”) that distances rather than embodies, and cadence leans on repetitive lyrical structures that border on templated.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is immaculate: Lirien notices “bait-flicker” shades, “whalesong silences,” hush “bloated with screams.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for secret-sharing, staccato beats during needle-plunges.

Voice remains distinct and consistent, with rhythmic control that heightens without obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating to match ascent (shorter sentences near climax). Perceptual signature is strong—Lira sees light as “captive auroras,” reads emotion in “swirling ink.” No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The intrusive word-count aside (“599—error…”) is a jarring artifact that momentarily fractures voice, but otherwise prose sustains controlled intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, filtered through Elias’s meteorological-poetic sensibility. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, flowing sentences for observation; clipped fragments for rupture (“quietly explosive twang”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is flawlessly controlled—first-person limited to Elara’s perceptual signature (posture/light over faces, fractal patterns over symmetry). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical in stillness (“hush just before”), taut during construction (“millimeter’s errancy would shatter the illusion”). Syntax mirrors theme—recursive clauses echo fractal structure. No head-hopping; even the foreman’s voice remains external sound, not interiority. Prose-as-character: her blindness shapes diction (“faces interchangeable smears”).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and idiosyncratic, with rhythmic control that modulates between contemplative and urgent. Elara’s sociable chatter feels character-specific, not generic narration.

POV operates as first-person plural (“they,” “their family”) without head-hopping, maintaining collective intimacy. Diction modulates under pressure—shorter clauses at climax (“Four sets of hands gripping ropes”) heighten rhythm. One slip: Thorne’s “storyteller’s intuition” borders on label-speak, but his nod feels earned by prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is stable, deeply interior, and voice-specific: Elias perceives the world through poetic, grief-tempered lenses (“dusk bled bruised purple,” “time’s final ripple”).

    POV is tightly controlled third-limited to Elias, with perceptual signature evident in how he notices type blocks, refractions, and emotional vectors. Voice modulates under pressure: syntax shortens during the transpose peak (“He staggered… fear flooded his veins”).

Rhythmic control under stress: short sentences during discovery, flowing cadence in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)

Elara’s perceptual signature filters everything through loss (“sky bruised with cerulean regret”). Hiroshi’s slow-spoken diction contrasts effectively. However, repetitive syntactic structures (“rhythmically placid” x3, “diffuse” x4) create a template cadence that dulls propulsion in mid-story, though it serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized.
