  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Psychic distance is controlled, but diction drifts into elevated register ("annealed," "drifting resonance," "luminous testament") incongruent with a character in acute physical distress. Voice texture is ornate and uniform across beats, lacking modulation under pressure. Filter verbs appear but are not intrusive. The prose reads more like authorial narration than Elara's perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elara, with clean focalization and perceptual bias (silence as vault, vibration as truth). Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("profoundly silently expressive grace," "monument to unspoken guilt") that occasionally tilts into elevated register ("rectify the fracture") but remains mostly controlled. Narrative distance modulates purposefully at the closure beat, tightening to shared perspective ("They understood"). Some filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "watched as magenta softened") are voice-motivated but cluster in the final third. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve emotional beats, though the prose occasionally over-explains what the scene shows.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a meditative, slightly elevated register that fits Elias's decades-long vigil. Perceptual signature is present (he notices water-stained entries, fiber, memory dimensions). However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-like phrasing ("chased stillness," "occupy impossible spaces," "revitalize") that reads more as imposed vocabulary than Elias's natural interior lexicon. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates appropriately from weariness to quiet triumph, but the voice lacks a truly distinct syntactic or imagistic fingerprint.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("reverent hands," "prayer in the hushed light") that strains against the tactile urgency of midnight runs. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The phrase "amplified quiet" recurs purposefully to anchor tone, and the prose modulates from urgent (runs) to ceremonial (bell moment). However, Lin and Lena lack distinct speech or perceptual signatures—they are shaped by Elara's lens, not their own idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: light, shadow, inverted optics. Diction is consistent and controlled, favoring lyric compression ("pilgrim of sparks," "theater of reversed reality"). However, elevated register pervades even peak moments—"visceral flash," "compassion's memory," "seamless harmony"—without modulation under pressure. The breathing sequence could tighten syntactically to reflect urgency, but instead maintains an even, ceremonial cadence throughout. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the voice is singular but unvaried by tension.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV with stable distance and consistent literary register. Perceptual signature reflects Elara's horticultural expertise and grief-laden focus. Diction remains elevated throughout ("retrocognitively trapped," "geodesics that diverged into infinity") with consistent voice. However, peak moments lean toward ornate phrasing ("quaking reverie," "trembling not with grief but connection") that abstracts emotion rather than embodying it. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in the disintegration sequence is legible but borders on lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and elevated ("chained liberator," "monastic devotion," "sundial's hand"), consistent with a contemplative register. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. However, the prose converges on a uniform poetic texture across beats regardless of pressure (dust motes, golden light, staggering grace all carry similar rhythm), reducing perceptual signature. The final image ("arrow...warm in her palm") and recurring "staggering grace" phrase demonstrate purposeful recurrence, but the voice does not modulate under stress, and the lyric diction occasionally drifts into generic elevation ("sacred tether," "quiet ember").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is single, stable, and third-limited. Diction ("battered marvel," "sacred geometry," "resilient echo") exhibits a lyric, elevated register consistent with Elara's designer sensibility. However, perceptual signature is thin—her synesthesia is told ("colors Elara heard as a faint, crystalline choir") rather than woven into embodied perception under pressure. Elevated metaphoric density in reflective passages ("silence's sacred geometry," "cycles continuing while cells divide") drifts toward committee voice in the final third, reducing character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("she noticed how the shadows lengthened just so") but the diction tilts toward elevated register ("liquid radiance," "luminous disbelief," "awe at the elegance of the revelation") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Interior syntax remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, though the final reflective turns lean into summary ("she was no longer merely a thief") rather than maintaining the urgent present.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—ritualized narration of mundane tasks, warm voice against cold metal—provides texture, though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pilgrim seeking liquid light," "weighty lightness") that reads more writerly than character-specific for a glassblower in crisis. The dramatic self-narration ("Behold," "From chaos, intention emerges") establishes voice early and modulates during emotional peaks, but the prose maintains decorative density even under pressure, which flattens urgency. Psychic distance is controlled, though free indirect style sometimes blurs into authorial commentary ("The core concept was no metaphor: it was sweat on her brow"). No dialogue is present. Filter verbs appear sparingly and voice-motivated. The final paragraphs sustain the reflective cadence without introducing new register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable and third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is present in early beats ("feverish betrayal," "skeletal ruin"), though it flattens under peak pressure when clarity would benefit from sensory collapse. Lily's dialogue carries age-appropriate simplicity, but Elara's internal voice drifts toward elevated register ("trembling certainty," "forging a trembling certainty") that clashes with crisis idiom. The closing dialogue—"No, sweetheart. *We* were brave together. That is the real power."—reads as thematic summary rather than lived speech, and the phrase "trembling certainty" recurs as a tic rather than a voice-specific rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV is stable throughout; distance and focalization remain consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "crystalline fragments"), controlled and purposeful, though occasionally the register climbs into decorative territory ("pinpoint of stillness feeling like a celestial promise"). Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices sound-absences and silence-layers in a profession-specific way. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately as the work progresses. Sentence rhythm varies and supports the contemplative tone without lapsing into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable throughout; Unit Seven's perceptual signature—"optical sensors," "chronometer," "manipulators"—is consistent and robot-particular. Free indirect style is clean. However, register drifts upward in reflective passages: "pedagogical sanctuary," "cognitive amalgamation," "mindful presence" feel more authorial than robot-voice, especially under the accumulative pressure of forty-three loops. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity at the violin beat, but the final paragraph's elevated diction ("testament to truth found in humble work") pulls away from the established technical-observational voice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Elara's reverent perception. Diction is elevated and lyric ("mosaic of shock," "fortress of his isolation," "resonant hush") with consistent register. However, elevated phrasing pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation: "She understood then: honesty was not about perfect clarity, but the courage to reflect another's truth without fear" reads as thesis rather than urgent realization. Kael and Elara do not speak; their silence is purposeful but limits voice distinction testing. Psychic distance holds steady, though perceptual specificity—Elara's way of noticing—defaults to general lyricism rather than character-particular filtering. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; the prose is legible but tonally uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature (soil over silicon, breath syncing with motion) is character-specific. The dialogue exchange with Kael is functional and advances the confrontation, though Elara's line "The garden knows a closed heart" borders on thematic exposition. Free indirect style is clean ("wisely pragmatic resolve," "rustle of gratitude deeper than wind"), but occasional elevated diction ("embodied the core concept of mended deception") pulls out of lived voice into meta-commentary. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the confrontation, longer cadences in ritual), and no head-hopping is present.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Kael throughout. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful cadence modulation at key beats (the lever pull, the hologram's unveiling). However, diction occasionally elevates into ornate metaphor ("alchemy of icy warmth," "quiet language") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a mechanic, even one with scientific curiosity. The prose maintains clarity and no head-hopping occurs, but the perceptual signature leans toward uniform lyricism rather than Kael's specific, mechanically grounded way of seeing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyric, and consistent, with a distinct texture in phrasing like "realm of in between spaces" and "aqueous script." Psychic distance remains stable; Elias's perceptual filter (musician's fingers, hearing silent melodies) colors the narration. However, certain phrases—"lately inspired" repeated three times, "wordless conversation" as both descriptor and theme label—feel more like prompt echo than character-specific idiom. The prose occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("reverent finger," "profound peace") that abstracts emotional states rather than embodying them through micro-sensation. No head-hopping or POV leakage, and the lyricism serves the Accumulative mode, but voice distinctness under pressure is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; Elara's perceptual signature (peripherally aware, margins-first) is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her immediate crisis register ("the beautiful, aching recognition of love persisting through loss"), though the elevated moments align with post-fever clarity. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose successfully modulates from fever-drift fragility to firmer resolution without voice rupture. No dialogue is present; judgment limited to narrative voice, which remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Leo with distinct perceptual signature (explorer's eye for decay, skeptic's scoff at spirits). The substantial reflection block at the wheel is anchored by tactile contact but flattens present pressure during the key revelation, becoming expository. Diction stays consistent ("frail path," "sorrowful eye") and voice-appropriate. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("reached out," "replayed") accumulate without serving immediacy, costing −0.3 in momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture—reverent diction, balanced cadences, purposeful compression ("cradle of crumbling peace"). Psychic distance is controlled, and perception is filtered through Elara's priorities (moss, roots, stone). However, under peak moments the diction remains uniformly elevated without modulation for urgency, and there is no dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was the library's true heartbeat," "was not dying") are frequent but voice-motivated. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks the contradictory pressure that would sharpen voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elara's perceptions. Diction is lyric and controlled: "dreaming roots," "cautious exuberance," "dew-jeweled spiderweb" establish a consistent register. Liam's brief dialogue ("It's getting dark," "The link is real") feels natural for a seven-year-old. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("infinite cosmos," "celestial grace") that reads more authorial than therapist-filtered. Elara's internal voice is coherent but uniform; stress does not degrade her syntax or compress her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through the historian's perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive…attuning him to the whispers"). Diction is consistent and elevated ("profound stillness," "bronze quiet"), fitting the meditative register. However, voice occasionally slips into thematic summarizing rather than embodied perception: "He understood the displaced axis was dual" reads more like narrator interpretation than character thought. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately from the opening's patient pacing to the diary's urgency, then back to quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering through Silas's perceptions ("salt-stained," "rose-gold light," "haunted by the accidentally prophetic nature"). The prose carries a distinct, slightly archaic texture ("ceased sweep," "transpose…into a new key") that suits the lighthouse keeper's voice. Dialogue, when it appears, advances plot and feels natural: Elara's "I counted the gulls—three times" carries subtext and goal. Minor diction slips: "motivation burned clear" and "orchestrate by directing flow" drift toward abstraction and repeat prompt language without full dramatic grounding. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "knew this phrase") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited from Kael's POV is stable, with no head-hopping. His perceptual signature (sound-as-weave, silence-as-canvas) is distinctive and consistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Kael's looped rhetorical questions pursue goals and carry subtext. However, elevated diction ("plumb the abyss," "censer," "confessional") occasionally drifts above the immediacy of a peak exorcism beat, and the phrase "muffled clarity" recurs as a descriptor without fresh modulation. Psychic distance remains controlled, and tense is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering perception through Elara's particular lexicon (cryptic fortunes, sacred cartography, logarithmic curve). Distance control is consistent, with free indirect passages ("She was no longer remembering; she was conducting") that align with her professional and emotional registers. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices geometric precision, emotional resonance frequencies, and textural memory details. One friction: vocabulary occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("reverent quietude charged with potential") that, while voice-plausible for a fortune writer, sometimes flattens immediacy under peak pressure. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful and serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited and the perceptual signature (inverted gravity, rune-focus, temporal suspension) is distinct early. However, diction drifts into elevated register that strains credibility for a narrator under peak stress: "metaphysical sliver," "algorithmically weaving," "mosaic of understanding." The voice reads more as descriptive essay than embodied interiority; Elara's thought processes are narrated rather than lived. Psychic distance oscillates without clear purpose between close sensation and distant summary.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Elara; perceptual filtering (chalk dust, chinrest curve) is character-specific. Kael's signing is handled cleanly without head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing ("fertile ground," "vibrant, humming aliveness") strays toward lyric generality under peak emotion. No dialogue per se (signing substitutes), and the voice remains coherent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the drum sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (storm recorder's precision, barometric diction). Psychic distance remains controlled, modulating appropriately from vigilance to calm. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("nurture integrity in solitude," "fortified calm," "anchoring") in ways that feel more thematic than character-particular under peak stress. The prose lacks a strong idiomatic stamp—Elara's internal voice reads competent but not indelibly distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is close and consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("liquid silver," "phantom imprint of desperate hands"), fitting a poet-focalizer. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical prose ("the tension between paths," "tapestry woven from every choice") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The poet's perceptual signature (tracing grooves, brushing time's fabric) is specific, but the voice in reflection sometimes loses the grit of immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("velvety blanket smothering," "golden thread stitching hope") that fits the post-apocalyptic elegy tone. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("unbind: gentle liberation of potential from despair") that feels like authorial summary rather than Elara's lived perception. No dialogue present; POV modesty holds, though some metaphors are overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization with strong perceptual signature: "static electricity translated the petal's story into sensory echoes—rain on cobblestones, a whispered apology, hollow regret." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("affectionate detachment," "subsume"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately under pressure (closer during the subsume act). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. A minor slip: "habitual affectionate detachment evaporated" is direct summary where a subtler shift in perception or gesture would strengthen voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext ("Sentiment overruled sense," "She says her job is to vanish") and distinguishes Liam's anxious formality from Elias's broker precision. Diction occasionally drifts high ("cautious exuberance," "tapestry of stars") but remains voice-motivated. The piece compresses reflection into image (lantern light, locket clasp) rather than summary. One slip: Liam's "legendary" and "implicitly" feel slightly elevated for spoken urgency, though the exchange remains natural overall.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited. Diction is lyric and elevated ("luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic"), consistent with the setting's mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction that flattens urgency. Dialogue between Elara and Kael is purposeful and carries subtext (hope, guardianship), but both characters speak in similarly formal, articulate registers without distinct idiom. Psychic distance remains controlled with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries an elevated, lyrical register consistent with Elara's illustrator profession—"lacework of aqueducts," "diorama of frozen motion," "spindle." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the Silent Pause, tightening to embodied perception (frost patterns, web tension). Weakness: recurring syntactic stems ("She believed," "She possessed," "She poured," "She would") and filter verbs ("noting details," "closing her eyes") dull immediacy in peak beats. The prose occasionally tips into decorative exposition ("an intricate lacework," "crystalline towers that scraped the sky") that pauses momentum rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance with strong perceptual filtering ("comforting percussion," "question posed to the stone"). Diction is elevated but consistent. Minor register drift: "dovetail his essence with the orchard's rhythm" and "invisible threads binding stone to tree" lean abstract in peak beats, weakening immediacy. No head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (alignment-seeking, gentle interpretation) is distinct and holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    The POV remains stable in close third, with Elara's perceptual signature (scent triggers, spatial precision, methodical observations) distinct throughout. The two brief dialogue lines from Evans feel natural and advance recognition. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Elara's established lexicon: "profound sapphire hush," "fortress of solitude," "sanctuary of memory and mercy" read more authorial than character-filtered, especially under pressure. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the climax, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature (professional nursery owner noticing moss, violets, clover) and rhythmic control under pressure. The brief dialogue with Mrs. Higgins feels natural and advances theme without exposition. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("circuitously sincere," "sustaining transformation") that clashes with the grounded voice, and the closing lines compress multiple abstract concepts in quick succession, softening immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV maintained throughout; psychic distance is stable and close-third. Perceptual signature is strong (painter's eye for "glistening pathways converging like veins," "sea glass gleaming like forgotten tears"). Diction remains consistent and literary without register breaks ("wryly earnest," "thresh meaning," "haggard awe" as recurring idiom). Elara's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I wondered if you would bring it back"). Brief elision of Elara's survival backstory is purposeful, preserving mystery that serves the accumulative closure. Minor: "sea-glass eyes" in Elara's introduction leans slightly decorative, though voice otherwise stays character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is stable and lyric, with controlled diction ("sanctuary of bright darkness," "silent patch in tomorrow's tapestry"). Psychic distance is consistent, and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") are voice-motivated. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("benevolent currents of energy," "compassionate weavers threading collective hope") that clashes with the immediacy of the ritual moment. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is generic; Elara's interiority lacks idiosyncratic syntax or selective bias that would distinguish her voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature shows through "water-bloated ledgers," "phantom chill of that silenced sound," and sensory attention to verdigris and linseed oil. The Elder Lin dialogue is brief and serves affirmation without voice convergence. However, elevated register in peak beats—"crystallized in one motivation," "emotional geography," "staggered intervals of recovered truth"—reads more essayistic than voice-particular under pressure. The narrative distance remains consistent, but diction doesn't degrade or tighten with stress as expected for this archivist's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and psychic distance narrows appropriately at peak beats. Diction is elevated and lyric, matching Elara's character. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical vocabulary ("lithic signposts," "alchemical work," "unspooling of self-deception") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially under emotional duress. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") stack in the final third without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is present (she sees arrows in cracks, symphonies in grates) but the specificity fades at closure, replaced by summary interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("sympathetic skeptic," star charts vs. superstition) anchors voice early, and diction elevates purposefully during the vision ("simultaneous, inseparable threads"). However, register drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("courageously kind," "sculpt space for reflection," "unheard symphony") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Liam's brief dialogue ("He's part of this journey too") carries subtext, but Elara's silent gesture and resting hand read as coaching rather than embodied character choice. Free indirect style is clean but occasionally slips into narration that explains rather than enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("prismatic escondite," "non-Euclidean geometries," "compassionate delivery mechanism") that clashes with immediacy under stress. Filter verbs stack ("He felt," "He perceived," "He saw") in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is generic—"dimensional awareness" is told as a trait rather than shown through specific, character-bound observation. Dialogue is absent. Distance control is consistent but the voice lacks distinct texture; syntax is uniform and ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature (brass, indigo, geometry of shadows) and diction that mixes professional forensic tone with lyric compression ("deathly vitality," "charged stillness"). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between action and reflection. Some elevated diction ("breach the invisible walls of expectation," "woven with compassion") risks register drift from the established voice under peak pressure, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable, single-focus, and closely filtered through Elara's studious attention. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("incandescent restraint," "blooming labyrinth"), with perceptual signature (charting micro-shifts, filtering sensory detail) consistent throughout. Register is elevated but voice-motivated. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The piece does not quite reach 9+ because rhythmic compression at peak beats ("Touching a gilded cherry branch, she felt...") edges toward summary rather than scene-present perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable single third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the industrial groan of cranes was not noise but punctuation," "every rust stain on container walls held the ghost of a story." Diction is controlled, lyric, and consistent—sensory archaeology filters everything. Distance modulates purposefully, moving from external observation to interior layering when the protagonist closes his eyes to reconstruct Dr. Thorne's memory. No dialogue appears. Reflection is extensive (~40% of the text) but anchored to present stimuli (the poison label, the tidal rhythm, the container maze) and interleaved with micro-actions (smoothing the label, placing it in the tin box, standing and gazing). Under the BRR reflection-led exception, the piece avoids penalty and maintains momentum through its accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Elara throughout. Perceptual signature—memory-driven, myth-buster's clinical eye softened by grief—shapes the narration. The reimagined dialogue at the climax is clean in focalization, though the grandfather's voice arrives with convenient clarity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral," "convergence," "sacred, fleeting act") that tensions the intimate moment but remains legible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates appropriately as emotion rises. Dialogue (grandfather's lines) feels natural and carries subtext about anchoring through love.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Voice carries carnival-specific texture: "salt-tinged wind," "perpetual carnival afloat," "calliope music." Diction stays consistent, though some abstract phrasing ("anarchic soul," "invisible bridges of memory") drifts toward elevated register during reflection. Perceptual signature is present—Kael notices geometric precision and artistic flourishes—but the interiority occasionally explains rather than enacts ("his orderly mind placed symbols"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled with purposeful modulation at dawn when community response is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance is controlled and voice modulates with emotional intensity ("profound silence," "sacred interval," "impossible gold"). Perceptual signature is selective (geologist's eye on "billion-year-old rock layers," "nickel-iron ore") and emotionally colored. However, several lines drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-grounded: "reverent presence," "knife-edge of irreversible change," "elegy, a precious visual testament to bequeath to future generations." Under peak stress (tear, shutter click), diction remains literary and distanced rather than compressing into immediacy. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is stable but the voice reads polished rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, and diction is controlled with consistent perceptual signature (light through water translated to warmth/shadow on skin, "voices" in metal fatigue). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the repair. However, elevated register ("magnetic calm settling over her like a familiar cloak," "sanctuary of ordered warmth") occasionally drifts above the tactile immediacy that anchors most beats, and the final paragraph's reflective summary flattens voice into thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: dry wit ("rather bold cartographic correction"), atlas-editor diction, subtly confident rhythm. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping or withholding. Perceptual signature is character-specific (she notices condensation patterns, phrasebook dog-ears, falcon flight paths). However, some diction drifts elevated in peak moments ("uncanny precision," "latent power," "silent confirmation") without clear voice motivation, and the single line of dialogue feels more ornamental than goal-driven or subtext-laden.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("a well of stillness forged by decades," "coaxing moss to retreat like respectful shadows"), consistent across the piece. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing reads as authorial rather than character-specific, and the prose does not degrade under the asserted stress of looming collapse. Filter verbs appear sparingly ("felt not sound, but a tremor"); the larger issue is register uniformity that abstracts rather than grounds sensory perception in Elara's particular expertise or emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Aris. Psychic distance modulates appropriately under pressure (vision tunneling, black spots). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm. However, elevated diction ("colossal archway veiled in ancient coral," "gathered hush") occasionally feels decorative rather than strictly character-filtered. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess noted.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("I chase no wolf. I offer sight"). However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated register ("copperlight repose," "the profound quiet of a truth finally witnessed") that clashes with the physical urgency of revealing hidden bodies. Perceptual signature is generic; Kael's way of noticing reads indistinct from the narrator's thematic commentary. Elias's speech carries slight distinction but not enough to avoid convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the ghost bride with clear perceptual filters (she recalls, she feels). The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("sanctuary of perpetual twilight," "ripple of sorrow and resolve") that suits the Gothic-fantasy frame. Diction occasionally drifts into labeling abstractions ("ancient clarity," "profound peace") rather than embodied particulars, and the narrative certainty about her emotional state ("mournful elation," "unwavering resolve") does not modulate under peak pressure. No dialogue appears. The final shift to Elias's perspective in the cottage and greenhouse is clean and purposeful, providing closure perspective without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The single-POV narration maintains stable psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register consistent with "poetic wharf weaver." Vocabulary is purposeful ("cobalt and ochre," "moon-silk and sea-grass"), though some phrasing edges toward stock lyricism ("honeyed fragrance," "profound hush"). The repeated phrase "hauntingly optimistic" and similar constructions ("fierce hope," "orchid solace") flatten the voice slightly. No dialogue appears; perception remains first-person close. Brief compression during sewing maintains texture without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression and elevated diction ("gossamer," "loamy," "woven into the orchard's eternal breath"). POV distance is stable throughout, and the perceptual signature—filtering the orchard through metaphors of reunion and continuity—is character-specific. However, the diction often drifts into abstract territory ("cautious enchantment," "interrupted journeys") that feels more authorial than rooted in Elara's immediate sensory experience under pressure, and the repeated stems ("she learned," "she gathered," "she would") create a template cadence in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third limited, and perceptual signature is present (Elara notices craft, margins, ephemeral art). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("delicate ecosystem of sound, history, and hidden emotional resonance") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure; the voice remains the same calm throughout, even at the tears-pricking moment, flattening emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows Elara's star-chart embroiderer lens ("threads of starlight silver," "midnight velvet"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register unsuited to urgent action: "synchronizing breath, intent, and thread vibration" (line 131), "manufactured disaster" (172), "arsenal of truth" (277). These phrases read as authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat ("She [verb]" at lines 188, 198, 214, 226, 252, 268) across the long night sequence, flattening rhythm under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV held throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the mangrove mysticism. Elara's dialogue ("You carry the silence of words unspoken") reads slightly stilted but fits the cryptic-medium archetype. However, diction drifts into abstract elevation during peak beats ("healing washed over him," "burden dissolving"), reducing embodied specificity under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (Kael's focus on regret, touch of letter) but not character-particular enough to distinguish from generic lyric fantasy voice. Compression at closure is acceptable, but the lack of textural specificity under stress limits high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Anahera with consistent focalization and perceptual signature (translator's gaze, Pacific anchors). Diction ("shrewdly innocent," "lotus-hearted ache," "unknot," "graft") recurs in patterns that support the concept but occasionally tip into authorial summary rather than Anahera's lived idiom. The whispered dialogue to Leo is the sole speech and reads natural. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she knew") cluster in the reflective middle without severe drag. Larger issue: the prose occasionally elevates into poetic register ("The mist swirled beyond the glass, catching starlight…") that, while beautiful, slightly exceeds the urgency of the vigil moment and converges with authorial voice rather than Anahera's stressed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's artistic perception. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("photons as her only pigment," "tactile whisper from a silenced era"), and the prose has a distinct lyric texture. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the daydream. However, several passages rely on elevated, near-ornamental phrasing ("pensive mirth," "luminous dialogue between absence and remembrance") that skirts the edge of the POV's plausible register under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("she could almost feel," "she saw") are voice-motivated but cluster in the daydream sequence. Perceptual signature is consistent—light, color, and memory—but the interior voice occasionally abstracts rather than staying grounded in sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Elara. Voice exhibits purposeful lyricism ("methodically playful precision," "fertile pause between inquiry and insight"), but diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred, breathless suspension," "bewitchment," "nested awakening") that clashes with concrete restoration work. The whispered question "What truth are you guarding?" and Elias's embedded laughter feel more allegorical than embodied. Perceptual signature is present (hands knowing "the language of cracked plaster"), but register inconsistency across beats—restoration craft versus poetic meditation—flattens interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Aris. Diction is elevated and consistent ("charming rogue scholar," "candidly cryptic," "cartographer of hope"), though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("psychic gravity," "architecture of liberation") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue carries subtext in the beetle/aphid exchanges. No head-hopping, but perceptual signature doesn't differentiate sharply under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with poetic diction that fits the character (e.g., "residual song of tides long turned to memory," "saltwater essence of reef-shadow joy"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature—centuries measured in longing, details filtered through insomnia and solitude—is consistent. No dialogue present. Register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("alchemy," "photosynthesized," "kiln of waiting") that feels authorial rather than emergent from the insomniac's idiom, and some figurative clusters ("sharp thorns...bloomed like night-blooming cereus") risk purple density, but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout—"spire of solidified mist," "pearlescent walls veined with shifting colors"—creating a consistent textural voice. Deduction: register drift into thesis language in the final two paragraphs ("enduring truth," "sacred duty") clashes with the established sensory idiom and reads as authorial summary rather than character perception. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara. The narrative voice tilts toward elevated register ("reverent finger," "coil of expectation," "cautious exuberance") that occasionally clashes with the urgency of the moment. Dialogue, when it appears, is functional but brief; Kael's lines ("You unsnarled the symphony," "it is a mirror for us") read slightly expository, delivering theme rather than pursuing goals with subtext. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices glyphs, ink particles, resonance) but lacks character-specific bias or selective attention that would distinguish her way of seeing from a generic scholarly narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV is stable; Kael's perceptual signature foregrounds mechanical detail (hairline fracture, brass links, spectrometer). Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional register drift into elevated phrasing ("mechanical sonnet," "resolving light") jars slightly against a machinist's lexicon. Dialogue from Elara and Borin is minimal but purposeful, conveying validation without exposition. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance appropriately tightens during the vents' test and the mountain's exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("meticulously mapping the swirling constellations," "testimony," "liberation") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular for a "quiet book mender." Perceptual signature is present—dust motes as historians, paper trails as sanctuary—but the metaphoric density is uniform across calm and peak beats, flattening urgency. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is consistent; the final smile and warm meteorite ground the ending in embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance and focalization remain consistent. Diction carries a distinct lyric register—"featherly determined," "fractured hush," "ozone and possibility"—that creates texture but risks elevating above the character's demonstrated voice under pressure. Purposeful compression and patterned vocabulary (e.g., "fractured hush" recurs as motif) are legible and taught by repetition, so experimental tolerance applies. However, perceptual signature is generic in peak beats: Elara's noticing is poetic but not character-specific (anyone could trace grain and see spirals). No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature (astrology metaphors, "shadowseam wonder"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous respite," "covenant," "continuum of light") that sits at the edge of her plausible lexicon but remains voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the firefly moment, tightening into memory then widening to present recognition. Narrative certainty stays within Elara's knowledge except for minor filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she knew") that slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with clean focalization through Elara's perceptual signature: her recollectionist vocabulary ("salt-etched memories," "transliterating emotions") and sensory priorities (visual light-patterns, tactile glass-weight). Distance modulates purposefully, tightening during testing moments and breathing in reflective beats. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("the cycle was intentional, sacred"; "time's grand tapestry") that feels slightly above the established voice's idiom. The prose has distinct texture in its chosen lyric-contemplative mode, though some phrasing ("a quiet compass in her heart") edges toward generic poeticism. No dialogue present to evaluate; the internal monologue remains consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Corbin throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—analytical, attuned to convergence points and variables. Diction stays consistent within his professional-mystical register ("orchestrated serendipity distilled," "lightly attentive focus"). No dialogue appears. The prose reflects Corbin's methodical mind through precise observation and ritual action. Some phrases edge toward elevated abstraction ("emotional horizons," "star-dusted wilderness of sky") that occasionally drift from embodied perception, but the core voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice is elevated and lyric throughout ("obsidian grace," "receding surf," "thermals of purpose"), which matches the mythic-fabulist register. However, diction does not modulate under pressure—Elara's narration at the moment of dissolution ("gentle, purposeful release") maintains the same smooth texture as the opening, missing an opportunity for syntactic or rhythmic shift. Kael's brief interior glimpse ("fear alchemized into resolve") is summarized rather than rendered in his own perceptual idiom. The single line of dialogue ("This verse is not memory...") is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with purposeful compression ("noctilucent reckonings," "aqueous script," "covenant") that reads as character-particular for a contemplative artisan. Psychic distance is stable, and perceptual signature—reading meaning in visual patterns—remains coherent. However, the diction occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("transience written in water," "profound stillness and lingering glow") that feels more authorial than immediate to Elara's lived moment under pressure. No dialogue appears (appropriately), and focalization is clean throughout. The prose modulates with the dawn shift but stays within a narrow emotional band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature (firefighter's touch, attention to fractures and scars) is consistent, and the elevated diction ("alchemy," "celestial dance," "syntax of scars") reads as purposeful lyric register. However, the prose uniformly maintains a high literary pitch without modulation under pressure, and several lines ("hard softness," "gently skilled," "slow dance of celestial bodies") echo prompt language directly, suggesting external framing rather than organic voice. No dialogue appears. The narrative distance is appropriate for reflection-led mode, but the vocabulary and cadence feel templated—many lines open with "He" + verb or noun phrase, creating rhythmic monotony that flattens voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the diction carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("cartographer of possibility," "lucidly watchful"). Perceptual signature is present in Elara's focus on mathematical metaphors and oceanic imagery. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow. Brief compression ("others joined, moving in a widening spiral") fits voice and pressure. Distance remains controlled, though the narrator occasionally tips toward expository summary ("This was revitalization: not revolution, but a gentle reawakening") rather than trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-poetic register with purposeful compression ("corridor echo cartographer," "symphonies of human experience") that reads as character-particular rather than generic. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices vibrations, textures, and layered time—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred duty," "covenant") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a woman kneeling on damp flagstones. Psychic distance modulates intentionally between close embodiment (trembling hands, tears) and reflective contemplation. Filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "felt") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue; N/A for that bullet.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register with controlled diction ("study in perceptively calm assurance," "liquid rainbows"). However, perceptual signature is generic—what the painter notices (moss, memory, droplets) could be any aesthete's catalog. Under pressure, the voice remains unvarying; stress does not compress or intensify syntax. No dialogue appears. The narrative certainty ("his work was done") asserts completion without showing the cost that would justify it.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a formal, elevated register ("operatively gentle," "muster every ounce") that fits a ritual negotiator but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fury only breeds more ash," "quiet certainty"). Dialogue is sparse but functional, with subtext in the elder's question and Kaelen's correction ("As anchor"). Internal voice remains consistent under pressure. However, perceptual signature is generic—no distinct idiom or bias filters the moons, limestone, or delegates in character-specific ways. The prose reads competent but not voice-driven, lacking the textural particularity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and close; diction matches Silas's pragmatic, slightly archaic register ("penitent," "ledgers," "armored his heart in steel"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the star convergence. The single line of dialogue ("This is release") reads as interior speech, voice-consistent. Perceptual signature is selective and biased: he notes precise coordinates, "polished city shoes," and "cut hospital ribbons"—details a man of systems would track. No head-hopping. Under peak stress, compression is acceptable and voice remains coherent. Minor demerit: "manufactured drought" appears in exposition rather than filtered perception in one early paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose establishes a consistent elevated register with metaphoric density ("bodily poetic," "liminal breath," "syrupy wave"), but the voice lacks perceptual signature specific to Elara; the diction could apply to any lyric fantasy narrator. Phrases like "her entire body swayed in a slow dance of restoration" and "instruments of truth" are stock poetic gestures rather than character-particular perception. Free indirect distance is stable, yet filter phrases ("she felt," "she thought") appear frequently without voice motivation. Under peak stress, the syntax remains uniformly ornate rather than compressing or fragmenting, flattening the sense of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice is elevated, controlled, with purposeful diction ("meteor hush," "urbane," "uncommon serenity"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias filters the dome through calligraphic metaphor and ethical abstraction. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The register occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("active stillness required to receive another's truth without distortion") and meta-commentary that feels external to the character's lived thought under pressure. Psychic distance holds steady, though the future-tense passages in the final third shift from witnessing present action to projecting intent, which loosens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization; no head-hopping. Diction ("esoteric realist," "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted") is consistently elevated but often abstract, leaning toward concept-speak rather than Elara's specific perceptual signature. Peak moments (the monarch's arrival, the splinting) lack the rhythmic compression or embodied urgency that would reflect her emotional state—syntax remains uniform and measured throughout. The prose texture is voice-consistent but does not modulate under pressure, reading more like narrated meditation than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature (hands, pressure metaphors, caster vocabulary). Diction remains within Elara's register except for occasional elevated phrases ("confluent ardor," "sacred trust for the waking world") that drift slightly corporate-spiritual. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the illumination beat. No head-hopping; the narrative stance holds. Minor template-cadence risk in the final third: several paragraphs open with "The sanctum / She / Each / The aurora" in sequence, creating mild rhythmic predictability.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable focalization through Elara. Diction elevates throughout ("ethereal peace layered over the gritty reality") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she understood") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy. The dream sequence shifts to present tense briefly ("A clockwork sparrow sang") without clear POV distance shift. Perceptual signature is generic; no idiosyncratic noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited remains stable with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is present (frugal precision, schematic thinking) but the elevated register ("poised anticipation," "silent symphony," "perpetual dawn sealed within his soul") clashes with the astronomer's practical idiom established early (measuring lamp oil, tracing reed stylus). No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "knowing") cluster in the final third without immediacy under peak pressure. Distance control is consistent but the voice lacks texture variation across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds Kael's focalization cleanly after he enters; his interiority uses concrete sensory anchors (cool ivory, vibrating palms, lavender scent). However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific idiom—"profound psychological precision," "cellular memory delivered the final truth" feel like narrator overlay rather than Kael's lived perception. The opening sanctuary description precedes Kael's arrival, creating brief omniscient distance. Diction remains elevated and uniform under pressure ("clean resonance of love") where stress would compress or fragment syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice is lyric, controlled, and purposeful: "fog became star-dusted nebula, bare limbs became constellations." Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices glass, light, and fracture—and the prose modulates with the beat (shorter clauses as the dream approaches). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted: "profound warmth," "shared gratitude," "conceptual resonance." Under peak pressure, the voice remains decorative rather than urgent, and the astronomer's single line of dialogue ("It held the alignment... the dream slipped when the glass broke") carries necessary exposition but lacks subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the ribbon memory, wider for the orchard survey). Perceptual signature is consistent—her "quartz-eye" lens, tool-focused diction ("suture," "resin," "spider-silk thread"). Dialogue, when it appears, carries subtext and goal pursuit: Lyra's "I thought you were rebuilding the old world" economically reveals her prior misreading. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("poignant gifts fulfilled their purpose," "tangible bridge") that feels more narrator than character under stress, and the final exchange risks therapeutic clarity ("I finally understood your wisdom") over embodied implication.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices artifacts, light patterns, constellations. Diction is elevated but consistent (e.g., "regolith," "zenith of blossoming cycle"). One register slip: "brightened disquiet" in the climax feels more authorial than character-specific, a label that doesn't quite match the prior concrete texture. Focalization remains clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (trembling fingers, gasping tears) and the voice maintains texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she "hears grammar in grooves," notices moonpetal cartography) but diction often drifts into elevated register ("cavernous silence," "temporal static," "vellum") that sits above an arcane linguist's internal lexicon under stress. Kael's single line of dialogue ("The Silence War… the lesson on listening") is functional but generic. The Warden's speech ("Seekers of the Unlearned must pay") and Elara's counter-rhetoric are formal and interchangeable in rhythm. Free indirect thought is consistent, though filter verbs ("she urged," "she declared") cluster in the Warden exchange. The final paragraphs shift into lyric summary voice ("she would spend her days carefully resourceful") that loses the on-page present anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV, stable third-person limited with a lyric-textured voice that matches the reflective, mournful tone. Diction is elevated and consistent ("mournful fog that swallowed horizons," "cathedral of her acceptance"), though some phrases veer into abstraction ("fundamental fracture," "narrative threads of joy, sorrow, and discovery woven deep within"). No head-hopping or POV leakage. The voice modulates appropriately with emotional beats (the journal discovery, the card's release). However, the prose occasionally sacrifices immediacy for ornamentation, and the final third repeats thematic claims in multiple registers without new perceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature (warmly methodical, archive-trained) is consistent. Diction stays within Elara's scholarly idiom: "meticulous records of voids," "schism required a specific action," "tactile and precise." However, the prose relies on elevated, almost liturgical phrasing throughout ("cathedral of measured time," "litany of remembrance," "silent testament") that flattens emotional modulation. Under peak stress (the climax), the register does not shift or compress; the same measured cadence persists. Filter verbs ("felt the cool void," "felt the archive's weight") are voice-motivated but cluster heavily, dulling immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (sonic and cartographic lens, "scribe's reverence," "lacework of fractures"). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, fitting the mapkeeper's voice. Under peak stress the prose remains ornate ("gently luminous pulse," "visual echo of displaced silence"), which is voice-consistent but risks slowing momentum. No dialogue is present. Filter use is restrained ("he knew," "certainty flooded"). The phrase "hammered repose" and "gently luminous" recur inways that feel pattern-taught rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (retrocognitive echoes, reverently traced fractures) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("thistle-blown hope," "profound stillness," "joyous chord cascading") that reads slightly detached from immediate perception under pressure. The vision sequence maintains clean focalization. Rhythmic control is steady but syntactic variety is limited in the buildup (multiple "she + past-tense verb" constructions). The prose modulates appropriately at the climax but the final line's meta-commentary ("proving that for those who track...") steps outside the character's moment into narrator summary.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (preemptive nostalgia, archival lens). Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("mother-of-pearl texture," "alchemized into quiet certainty"), matching the archivist's formal idiom. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she recalled") are frequent but voice-consistent. The register holds under pressure, though the final paragraph's rhythm ("She was the bridge. And as dawn's first...") edges toward proclamation rather than lived perception. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in imagery is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression and elevated diction that matches Elara's vocation and the story's reflective mode. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("liquid memory," "weaving the mosaic's wisdom into her vow") and the narrator's certainty about interior states ("felt the oppressive gravity dissolve") occasionally exceeds what direct perception would render. The chanting functions as character signature but is described rather than shown in distinct idiom or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (marine chronicler noting incremental movement, antennae testing futures) is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a meditative rhythm apt for the pause. Dialogue is minimal but naturalistic and goal-driven when it appears. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("seismic shift in the grotto's atmosphere," "weary hope mirrored") that risks distancing the reader during peak emotion. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's "ancient grotto held them" slips toward external observation. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited is stable with controlled psychic distance; diction ("xenial," "intangibly tangible," "stretching contracted") is elevated and consistent, reflecting contemplative quest idiom. Perceptual signature is selective: Elara notices silence textures, not visual clutter. Register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a silence with texture, weight, and the faint taste of honeyed light") that risks flattening immediacy. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present. Syntax is lyric and purposeful, though some constructions ("This action of sprouting—a quiet rebellion—was the silence made visible") lean explanatory rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara with brief access to Leo's perception in discrete beats (his ears straining, his heart drumming). Distance control is generally clean, though "grief-shadowed eyes" in the opening and "his expression shifted from anguish to tender recognition" read as external observation rather than Elara's specific noticing. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; Elara's lines carry a measured, instructive cadence appropriate to her role, and Leo's whispered reply feels earned. The prose has a distinct lyric texture—"vaulting hush," "willow-wood craft," "rivers of emerald and gold"—but the elevated register is uniform across emotional beats, lacking modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's attention to the storm glass and her calibrated voice, but some phrasing ("her patience a tangible anchor") drifts into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"liquid light shifting through hues of forgotten nebulae," "futuristic nostalgia." However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Elara notices the orchard's beauty but her way of seeing does not reflect her role as lore keeper with tactical or scholarly bias. Psychic distance is mostly consistent, though the final paragraph ("Her motivation had always been restoration, not rule") slips into retrospective omniscience that explains rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (shadows as sentient, silence as texture) but the diction often drifts into elevated, therapy-adjacent register ("empathy for fragility," "fertile potential," "spacious quiet") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The whispered dialogue ("Breathe with me") carries purpose but remains brief. Psychic distance is controlled, though the metaphor-heavy texture occasionally obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV stance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (bolt's texture, fungal light, comm buzz). Kaela's dialogue ("You carry deep-sea weight") and Elara's whispered reply ("A key") feel purposeful and carry subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("alchemy: to translate crushing pressure into diamonds of meaning," "shadowseam wonder incarnate") that, while lyric, strains against the immediacy of crisis. Free indirect style is clean, but peak-stress moments (kneeling, pouring memories) compress into summary rather than moment-by-moment perception. The glitchy texts' mechanical phrasing ("SEAM OPEN! FOCUS THE PROMISE!") contrasts effectively with Elara's interior voice, though their parallel-dimension premise is told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and voice carries a distinct, elevated literary texture ("fingers of golden shadow," "fossilized echo of resonance"). Elara's perceptual signature is consistent—she interprets sensory data through memory and metaphor. However, the prose leans heavily into elevated register throughout, with phrases like "eloquently silent" and "standing waves of recollection" that risk abstraction over immediacy. At peak moments (discovering the panel, reading the letter), diction remains lofty rather than compressing into sharper urgency, and the grandfather's remembered voice and the letter both speak in similar philosophical cadence, reducing voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and aims for lyric register, but the prose converges on stock fantasy-poetic constructions: "pledge my silence to the dream," "shivering bliss," "universe-sigh," "radiant openness to wonder." Psychic distance remains stable (close third), and focalization is controlled. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; Kael's noticing (sensory catalog, allegorical program) reads more like authorial world-building than a withdrawn knight's selective attention. No dialogue is present to judge. Figurative language is dense and often mixed (greenhouse as leviathan, paths as Möbius strips, light as nebula) without clear internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara's archivist lens filters detail through care and method. Psychic distance is stable, free indirect style is clean. However, diction drifts into elevated register at emotional peaks—"tactfully hopeful gesture," "philosophy unfurled," "gilding the hallway"—that strains the POV's lexicon under the established voice. Rhythm is controlled but becomes formulaic in the final third: repeated "she knew / she felt / she would" stems flatten propulsion. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and specific to an archivist's perceptual filter (ledgers, microfilm, census records), and psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats. Weakness: elevated register ("defiantly restored," "unignorable counter-narrative," "spirit unbroken, alight with the quiet fire") in peak moments pulls away from embodied immediacy, and sentence stems recur ("Her motivation was," "Her hands steady," "She had chosen," "She had used").

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "tendrils curling around ancient oaks like spectral fingers," "brass saxophone gleamed like captured moonlight," "fractured light coalesced into a quietly vivid image." Diction elevates consistently ("steeped in eerie nostalgia," "vested hush," "liminal moment"), matching a ritualistic, lyric register appropriate to a musician performing a mystical act. Register remains within plausible lexicon for a reflective, educated protagonist executing a solemn duty. Some filter verbs ("He remembered," "He understood") appear but anchor necessary backstory; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the performance beats ("lips finding the mouthpiece with muscle memory deeper than thought").

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register and there is no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("nascent hopes," "luminous moment," "sustaining mossy delight") that does not match the tactile seed-sorting frame. The prose texture is uniform across emotional peaks and calm beats, missing modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She watched") cluster without voice-motivated purpose. Elara's perceptual signature—what she notices and how—remains generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the tinkerer's lexicon ("gear," "mechanism," "seized by grit") colors perception. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure: "uncertain certainty," "silent language written in loss and leaf," and "beautiful, necessary space between broken and whole" clash with the grounded workshop voice. The admiral's note and Elara's sparse return dialogue feel natural, but the narrator's register becomes ornate in peak beats ("cascade of realizations," "truer guidance") where compression would better serve urgency. Psychic distance widens when meta-commentary intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout; no head-hopping or distance breaks. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register that strains credibility for moment-to-moment interiority ("luminous regret," "factually mystical," "philosophy of kintsugi intentions," "sanctity"). These phrases read as authorial framing rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance stays consistent but the perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—her way of noticing is generic rather than shaped by her occupational or personal bias. Sentence rhythm varies adequately but does not modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("her purpose was not to banish shadows but to listen within them") and diction is controlled, though it leans toward elevated lyricism ("luminous ache," "sonic key turning in a long-locked door"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Cora's lines carry subtext and advance plot. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (quiet at open, warm at closure). Minor register drift: "compassionate work" and "absolution" read slightly abstract for the visceral moment, and the final paragraph's thesis-statement cadence nudges voice toward essayistic summary rather than scene-rooted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.9)
    Voice is consistent but drenched in elevated, clinical register ("proprioceptively enhanced senses mapped the world," "ultraviolet penance," "topological pathways") that clashes with the POV's lived crisis. Psychic distance holds steady in close third. However, the diction reads as conceptual ventriloquism—no character in acute trauma speaks internally in recursive mathematical metaphors without a dramatized cost for that intellectualization. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose converges on a single ornate texture regardless of pressure. The perceptual signature (UV fractals, micro-movements) is specific but static; rhythm does not modulate under the supposed emotional peaks (tears, revelation).

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable single-focalization; perceptual signature is consistent (translator's eye for hidden details, anchors of intuition). Diction remains lyric and character-specific throughout, with purposeful compression that the piece teaches early ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition"). Free indirect style is clean. Dialogue (Cora's two lines) feels natural and advances the method. Psychic distance modulates intentionally during the memory beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering all perception through Leo's professional lens and empathic gift. Perceptual signature is consistent: he reads dust as "a language of absence and intention," notes "concentric swirls," and feels "empathic memory" rather than explicit ghost speech. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("profound silence of abandonment," "translucent man...glowing with sorrowful luminescence") that feels authorial rather than character-particular, especially under the pressure of the encounter. The narrative voice is clean but lacks the rhythmic compression or syntactic specificity that would elevate it to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance and focalization remain consistent. Diction is ornate and elevated ("serene suspension," "nascent awareness," "precipice") with a lyric register that fits the fantastical premise but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("negotiable nature of reality"). Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's way of noticing is not character-specific. No dialogue appears. Under peak stress (the rupture), diction remains elevated and uniform without compression or rhythm shift. Purposeful lyricism is present, but voice feels more generic-fantastical than individually textured.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction fluctuates between character-grounded perception ("cold truth," "burnished sorrow") and elevated thematic commentary ("polished ache of vindication," "sacred duty"). Elara's interior voice lacks distinct idiom; her perceptual signature defaults to ornate descriptors rather than selective bias. Valerius's brief dialogue ("Kaelen saw the soul we were too afraid to acknowledge") reads as thematic summary rather than subtext-driven speech. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the projection beat but loosens into expository reflection at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited is stable, but the prose frequently drifts into elevated register that exceeds Kael's focalizer lexicon: "paradoxical art," "amplifying pure sonic intention," "radical acceptance," "verdigris luminescence," "unwavering integrity." During peak stress the syntax remains ornate ("With a sound like the universe sighing relief") rather than compressing to match urgency. Filter verbs ("he perceived," "he reflected") are sparse, but the voice reads more like external narration about a mystic than the interior texture of a craftsman under pressure. No dialogue is present to test character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the ghost of water meeting ancient stone," "obsidian water," "resonant hush." Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent and elevated throughout, matching Elara's contemplative sensibility. Free indirect style is clean in the psychometry passage, where Thorne's panic and realization flood her senses without confusion. Rhythmic variation supports emotional beats (short declaratives at closure: "The delving was complete; the awakening was hers to carry"). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor note: a few filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable. Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally academic ("perpetual state of learning," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") for a sculptor under storm pressure. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the carving sequence. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature—rain tracing stone, turbine hum vibrating through bone—is character-specific. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority that explains rather than dramatizes, and the voice carries a sameness in rhythm and sentence structure across emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature—artist's eye for pigment, glass, light—is character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred threshold," "profound humility," "quietly driven woman who found divinity") that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived lexicon under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from observation to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with a consistent archival register ("ink stains of forgotten truths," "meticulous care"). Perceptual signature is present but leans elevated throughout, even under stress ("searing reverie," "archival certainty"). Diction occasionally drifts into glossy abstraction ("vessel for redemption," "absolution") that feels voice-polished rather than character-lived. Psychic distance is controlled, and the retrocognitive trap motivates the shift to Anya's viewpoint without head-hopping, though Elias's internal texture under peak pressure remains abstract rather than sensorily compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices resin scent, paper texture, stone surfaces. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though elevated at times ("sediment of the past," "crucible," "manifest"). Free indirect style is clean. The whispered line to the wind feels slightly performative but remains within voice. No dialogue beyond the single whispered vow, so conversational naturalism is not tested. Psychic distance is consistent; POV modesty holds.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "iron-gall ink," "velvet disquiet," "soft pink of a held breath." Diction is elevated and matches the venerable scribe's register throughout. The phrase "speaks dead languages with the ease of breathing" verges on expository self-praise but is brief. No head-hopping. Under peak pressure (memory immersion), the prose compresses slightly without losing coherence. The narrative certainty about the prophecy's meaning in the final third is high, but the POV's expertise in dead languages and decades of archival work justify the confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; focalization remains Elara-bound throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("reverent sweeps," "nascent energy," "wild serenity") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the wellspring of all borrowed moments," "visceral, sensory truth") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present in her seed-saver lens (naming each heirloom variety, noting "deliberate order from frozen chaos"). No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual bias (storm-tang, ice-crystal chimes, resin texture) shaping every beat. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close at the rope, wider for the sunset reflection. Voice is distinct and controlled. One slip: "credibly curious" and a few phrases ("steadfast resolve," "conscious switch") drift toward elevated diction that feels slightly imposed rather than organically Elara's internal idiom under pressure. Dialogue (two brief exchanges) is natural and advances theme without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct contemplative register ("profound hush," "primal elegance," "sacred method"). Perceptual signature is spiritually inflected and selective, filtering setting through reverence. However, elevated diction ("flourishing stillness," "tuning fork for the cosmos's subtle whispers") occasionally drifts beyond what the janitor's voice would naturally produce, and the prose converges on a single lyric texture without modulation under the meteor's peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Focalization is clean with no head-hopping, and purposeful compression (the shift from observation to descent to epiphany) is legible, though the register feels slightly imposed rather than organic to character.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focused on the recluse's perceptive stance. Diction is elevated and consistent ("tranquilly perceptive grace," "hallowed ground," "saturated the air") but occasionally edges into essay register ("contextual clues," "sustained, compassionate gaze") that feels more diagnostic than embodied. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator tracks only what the recluse observes. Perceptual signature—reading dust patterns, ghost postures, light angles—is character-specific. Rhythm modulates between lyric stillness and the ghost's kinetic loops.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV with a clean handoff to Elara at closure; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices textures, edges, weight. The diction ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "breathing tapestry," "pollen on the wind") sustains a lyric register throughout, avoiding register drift. Purposeful compression in the timeless-sea passage is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Distance remains stable. Minor note: the card's direct address ("Hold it, and know:") briefly shifts into instructional voice but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and distinct ("burnished hush," "sleeping birds," "raw poetry stirred"). POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices ripples, cloud-shapes, the feather's barb alignment. However, the prose leans heavily on elevated diction and metaphor even in peak beats (kite fall, feather discovery), creating a static lyric register that does not modulate with urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature (orchard herb tea, diary maps, palm-to-bark ritual) is character-specific. Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated ("brazen calm," "gently systematic"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during wire-wrapping beats. Two frictions: late-story sentences ("He had remodeled more than stone and wood; he had remade understanding") drift into summary register that exceeds Kael's diction under stress, and repetitive sentence stems in final third ("Kael's breath," "Kael exhaled," "Kael closed") flatten rhythmic control when urgency should sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Aris as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated-scientific register ("Eocene-era insect," "volatile compounds in Mesozoic amber deposits") that fits her academic background. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract descriptor phrases ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious spirit," "bronze quiet") that tell rather than embody perception. The dialogue with Elias is minimal and functional; their exchange advances plot but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance remains steady but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Kael throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—translating bird calls into dead languages—is distinct and purposeful, and the narrative voice carries a ceremonial, slightly archaic register ("his gnarled hands feeling the cold history," "the essence of narrow vastness") that suits the premise. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated authorial diction ("a narrow ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling," "a persistent argument for peace written in chlorophyll and light") that feels more written than thought, reducing the sense of true focalization under pressure. Psychic distance remains steady but does not modulate with emotional intensity; Kael's voice at the climactic nightingale moment reads the same as during the opening carriage halt. The piece teaches its pattern of bird-language translation cleanly, but the prose lacks the rhythmic compression or syntactic shift under stress that would demonstrate mastery in the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct: "intuitively descriptive" texture colors perception ("rust patterns," "creaking hinge"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the leaf-tracing, wider during Elder Anya's arrival). No head-hopping. Anya's dialogue ("Only you can read them, Bloodhound") carries subtext and goal. Minor artifact: "The riddle circled its base" uses passive where active subject would sharpen; "silent conversation between artifacts" edges toward overwriting but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV control is clean; Elara's perceptual signature filters the scene through astronomical training and grief. Diction is generally consistent, though occasional phrases ("temporally stretched dreamscape," "latent meaning") drift into elevated register that feels slightly external to her immediate experience. The prose modulates well under pressure—short sentences at the Lyre glimpse, longer syntactic flows during reflection—and the voice remains coherent throughout. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("sacredly playful reverence," "cautious abandon"), creating a distinct fairy-tale register. However, the voice occasionally drifts into abstract labels ("embodied cautious abandon," "sacredly playful amendment") and thematic placeholders that feel authorial rather than filtered through Kael's perception under stress. The chess-piece descriptions carry purposeful detail, yet the narrative certainty—"secrets of control," "secrets of harmony"—asserts knowledge without showing how Kael apprehends or interprets those abstractions in the moment. Rhythmic control is strong in the swapping beats, and the short closing paragraphs modulate effectively. The lack of dialogue and the absence of perceptual surprise or misreading under pressure keep the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and clean. Diction maintains an elevated, lyric register throughout, with purposeful compression and poetic phrasing. However, the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: stock phrases like "fragile flame," "profound silence," and "quiet symphony" could belong to any contemplative narrator. Psychic distance remains uniformly remote, offering no modulation under pressure. Elara's interior is all thesis, no texture.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature clear: "mercury-glass seer" lens colors early description, then shifts to tactile precision during the feather ritual ("impossibly soft barbules whispered comfort"). Diction is controlled and literary ("aching hum beneath her ribs," "autumn leaves") without register breaks. The prose modulates with pressure—short syntax during the seeding ("she held fast"), lyric expansion at closure. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: the stone "projected the translated essence" reads slightly external, as if narration steps outside Elara's perception, but recovery is quick.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, and Kael's chess-tutor perceptual signature is consistent (pawn structures, defensive nuances, silent game). Diction remains elevated and metaphor-dense throughout, which fits the reflective tone but occasionally slips into uniform lyricism ("a breath held between the storm's growls," "spun moonlight"). The prose modulates slightly—clinical during decoding, warmer at the village's awakening—but the syntactic texture is fairly uniform. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is close and controlled, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The voice is distinct, though the elevated register is consistent rather than character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and POV throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled but leans heavily on elevated register ("refracted," "forged hush," "ossuary labyrinth") that risks outpacing character interiority. The repeated phrase "innocently mischievous" and stock constructions ("her spirit refusing," "voice thick") flatten texture. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Elara's and Borin's lines carry distinct enough registers, though both edge toward thesis articulation rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Kael's perceptual signature (alchemist's precision, grief-sharpened focus) is consistent. Narration remains within his plausible lexicon except for occasional elevations ("topography of endurance," "quilting memories" as concept-label). The final paragraph's summary voice ("Uncertainty dissolved, replaced by profound peace settling deep within his bones") drifts toward therapeutic tell rather than staying in embodied pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Elias's painter's sensibility (pigment-stained fingers, exact gradient, rose quartz bleeding into liquid gold). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout—"fleeting poetry," "tidal urgency," "intimate aloofness"—which reads consistent for the narrative voice but risks aesthetic monotony under emotional pressure. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is strong (visual artist's eye), though the prose occasionally slips into abstraction ("temporary eternity," "intimate aloofness") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains close without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization through Elias is stable, with perceptual signature (grief, reverence, sensory attention to scent and light). Silas's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("raw thread," "stripped of bluster") that contrasts with Elias's silent, interior register. Diction is controlled and elevated without breaking plausibility for a reflective assistant keeper. The phrase "screaming tenderness" recurs in narration and risks authorial intrusion, but the overall texture remains consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (star charts, salvaged parts, rosin scent) is character-specific. Diction remains within Elara's technical-grieving register throughout. However, peak emotional beats rely on filter verbs and abstraction: "tears fell—not of despair, but release" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses. The phone-voice dialogue ("Seek the anchor in the ash") is serviceable but generic. Rhythmic control is present but does not modulate under pressure; syntactic variety is limited by repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable and Elara's perceptual signature—rational forager's precision, botanical detail, ritual logic—is consistent and distinct. The prose modulates between lyric compression and concrete observation without head-hopping. However, therapeutic register ("psychological safety," "hyper-vigilance") intrudes at peak moments, pulling the voice toward clinical abstraction rather than character-specific idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Silas, and the perceptual signature ("he recognized its signature in this abandoned token") is consistent, filtering the scene through a lighthouse keeper's practiced observation. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the chasm between isolation and connection") that reads more authorial than character-particular, and the narrative voice converges with thematic commentary in the final third ("some memories are borrowed not to be solved, but to be held") rather than trusting image alone. Psychic distance tightens during the reflective investigation but loosens into summary in the final paragraphs, where the prose tells the reader what has been witnessed rather than letting the image do the work. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he thought") appear throughout but are voice-consistent rather than dulling.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and Elias's perceptual signature (map dealer, observer of patterns). Diction is largely controlled, though occasional register drift: "phosphorescent fungi swirled like constellations" and "profound peace" lean literary-elevated. No dialogue to evaluate. The final paragraph's "empirically intuitive heart" is a tonal wobble—academic phrasing in a lyric beat. Free indirect style is clean throughout; filter verbs ("he understood") are used purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, creating a consistent lyric register. However, the prose leans heavily on ornamental phrasing ("lacy menace," "star-forged purpose," "celestial wound weeping luminous sorrow") that risks overwriting without grounding the queen's perceptual signature in character-specific bias. The dialogue line ("Show me the truth you bleed") arrives late and feels performative rather than goal-driven. Under peak stress (the vision), syntax remains ornate and does not compress to reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV Elara is maintained with stable third-person limited distance. The prose carries a consistent lyric-romantic register ("roots seeking water," "released breaths," "hidden architecture") but diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("density of presence," "chromatic embrace," "directed spontaneity") that feels thesis-driven rather than character-particular. Kael and Lyra's brief dialogue is purposeful and distinct in rhythm. The voice reads as authorial thesis delivery rather than Elara's lived perception; her professional alchemist lens never filters sensory detail in a character-specific way (e.g., chemical precision, material texture).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance tightens during the dream flight and the jealousy beat. Diction is largely character-particular ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "chronologically confused"), though "the precise method by which the feral nostalgia chose to manifest its pain" feels over-articulated for a crisis moment. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias filters the world through a chronicler's lens. No dialogue; all pressure runs through interiority and dream imagery. Filter verbs ("felt," "could not access") appear but remain voice-motivated. The scroll's message introduces a tonal register slightly elevated from the prior voice, but it's framed as ancient script, mitigating the slip.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Elara's perceptual signature (tactile memory, visual focus on wear patterns) distinct and voice-consistent. Mrs. Gable's brief dialogue ("You have mended more than metal") carries subtext and advances relational closure. The prose modulates effectively from meditative opening to focused repair to reflective end. Minor slip: elevated diction ("alchemy," "trembling calm," "gilding the wet cobblestones") occasionally drifts above the POV's immediate sensory experience, favoring lyric effect over strict interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose carries a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled psychic distance and consistent third-limited focalization. Perceptual signature is strong: "saturated hush," "liquid starlight," "silvered scars warmed." Some register drift occurs during peak beats—"compassionate teacher," "unguarded heart of her younger self"—where elevated diction slightly exceeds what Elara would think mid-crisis. No head-hopping; tense and stance are stable. The narrative voice remains coherent under pressure, though a few filter verbs ("felt," "understood") dull immediacy where direct perception would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cathedral of suspended breath," "ghost of memory weaving"), creating a distinct lyric texture that fits the exorcist-as-metaphor conceit. However, the prose occasionally drifts into register excess ("profound reconnection," "forgiveness's gritty alchemy," "ethereal grit coated her soul") that reads more as authorial annotation than Elara's lived perception under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Valerius's voice ("you advise through metaphors") and Elara's metaphorical replies feel voice-distinct. The perceptual signature—scent, sound, tactile cold—is character-specific, though the lexicon sometimes inflates beyond what stress would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is controlled and consistent: elevated diction ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact") matches the archaic setting and witness role without register drift. Psychic distance remains stable in tight third, filtering all perception through Elara's singular stance. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively—short declarations at closure ("I am"), longer constructions during contemplation—and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs. The perceptual signature (words as tangible, silence as presence) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: patient, observant, attuned to hydraulic rhythms and horizon precision. Diction remains consistent—"eminently peculiar," "profound fjord quiet," "razor edges"—and the prose modulates under pressure (shorter fragments at peak ritual moments). However, elevated register occasionally drifts: "surgically precise line," "immense quiet," "the precious distance" feel slightly ornamental rather than voice-rooted. The mentor's dialogue ("Time is the space between the ticks") is memorable and purpose-driven, advancing the shepherd's method.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled and carries a consistent lyric-literary register with purposeful compression and some perceptual signature (her academic lens, the clover-melancholy framing). Filter verbs and free indirect style are handled cleanly. However, the diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("profound understanding," "heartfelt connection," "gentle, lucid contradictions") that sits uneasily with peak emotional beats, and some phrases ("theoretical rebellious nature was no longer protest, but synthesis") read more as thematic announcement than interiority. The father's recalled voice is indistinct from Elara's narration, reducing voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a consistent register ("melodically haunted," "honest echoes") and perceptual signature (every sound becomes musical notation). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, and the caller's voice carries distinct vulnerability. However, elevated diction ("cultivated estrangement," "purposeful architecture") occasionally drifts above the tunnel's grit without clear tonal purpose, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("ready for the next ring") externally narrates rather than inhabiting Elara's present sensation. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose modulates less under peak pressure than the score demands for 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the archivist's attention to precision ("gently thorough"), walnut ink, and ritual method. Diction ("liminal grace," "threshold when context changes") is elevated but mostly voice-consistent for a lettered character. However, phrases like "haunted euphoria" and "proximate causes" read closer to prompt vocabulary than organic interior language under grief's pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. Rhythm modulates purposefully between expansive description and compressed action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Elara throughout. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("dusk bled gold," "time pooled like spilled ink") that remains consistent and suits the reflective, atmospheric design. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the encounter, more distant during exposition. The "desperately jocular" trait appears in dialogue ("Nothing like a collapsed bridge...!") and internal bark, but the voice distinction between Elara and the young woman is thin—both speak in hushed, hope-laden tones. Filter verbs ("She knew," "She saw," "She felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative stance. Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices connection chains, logistical particulars) but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable, third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature (skin-absorption, touch-first sensing). Diction is controlled and lyric, though occasional elevated phrasing ("poignant chord woven into the evolving trail") drifts slightly above the established tactile register. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and fragment use ("Elara halted, breath caught. She had arrived.") fits the quiet, accumulative design. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable single-character third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (astronomer's eye: "harmonic resonance," "gravitational shear," "verification pulses"). Diction mostly fits the technical-philosophical register. Weakness: the prose repeatedly uses identical sentence stems and rhythmic patterns—"She had," "The anomaly," "The pen"—creating template cadence. Peak beats compress into parallel constructions ("not a ghost, but a participant"; "not to alter…but to weave"; "no longer flight, but cultivation") that feel rhetorically shaped rather than stress-compressed thought. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, and the prose attempts a lyric register. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("the hollow quiet threatening to erase forgotten lives," "alchemy transforming absence into tangible, beautiful presence") that feels imposed rather than emanating from Elias's interior voice. The narrative distance blurs—some passages read as close third, others as distant commentary. Lily's brief dialogue in sign carries clarity, but the framing narration's rhythmic uniformity and stock phrasing ("quietly charismatic grace," "whispering advisor") flatten the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person close on Kael, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("volcanic tenderness," "tears, hot as embers yet gentle as dew"). However, the diction often drifts into elevated register ("analytically intuitive perception piercing the surface horror") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The repeated phrase "volcanic tenderness" and similar constructions ("meticulous, tender act") create a template cadence. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Kael's way of noticing doesn't reveal idiosyncratic bias beyond his redemption arc.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a lyric register that fits the premise. Perceptual signature is present in synesthetic detail and the focus on sound/touch. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("auroral sorrow saturated the air," "polyrhythm of love and loss") that, while voice-motivated, verges on decorative during peak beats. The prose texture is distinct but leans toward pattern-taught lyricism that risks distancing the reader from Kael's immediate embodied experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance. Kael's perceptual signature—mapping sound currents, reading gaits—is specific and maintained under pressure. Vale's dialogue ("How? I yelled for twenty minutes") carries subtext and exhaustion. Elevated diction occasionally intrudes: "calculated spontaneity," "residual hum of the vanished whisper," "recalibrated." Filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") cluster in reflective passages but do not obscure immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored in Kael's perceptual signature (silence, calm, purposeful gesture). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("spiralingly calm," "vastening sky," "louvered shutters"), though some phrases ("stillwater tension," "the darkness within her") verge on stock lyricism. Filter verbs ("observed," "feeling") appear but remain voice-motivated. Minor slip: Elara's interior ("the secret's sharp edges began to blur") briefly shifts psychic distance without clear justification, as we primarily track Kael's empathic read rather than her direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV (Elias) is stable with clean focalization; his perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words) is selective and character-specific. The prose modulates with emotional intensity: quiet reverence in the opening, rising tension during the pre-dawn placements, gentle resolution at closure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance shifts are intentional (e.g., the shift to students' unspoken voices). One slip: "Elias heard Maya's whisper" slightly externalizes what should remain internal texture, but the effect is minor and doesn't disrupt distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV remains stable in close third with Elara's perspective throughout, and diction ("harbor's grime," "sublittoral fringe," "iridescent dust") reflects her maritime background. However, the prose slips into therapeutic abstraction ("detach from the armor of shame," "combative tenderness of this sanctuary") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. The interiority is over-articulated at peak beats ("honoring the pain while choosing gentleness") where compression and embodied action would sharpen voice. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with concrete perceptual signature (dust motes, knife flash, blood bead). Elias's theatrical narration ("Behold!" / "Observe the emergence of grace!") provides distinct voice texture that modulates from performance to prayer. Minor slips: "profound alchemy in his perception" and "sustainable lightness within grief itself" drift toward essayistic register; the phrase "he fully grasped the remade hush" tells insight rather than showing it through the bird-in-bouquet image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Voice remains distant and elevated throughout, with diction ("aesthetically driven," "lantern-moth hush," "tremor of certainty") held in a uniform poetic register regardless of pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The poet [verb]" and "Where X let Y" structures recur without variation. Perceptual signature is generic—cloud, shadow, beauty, harmony—without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt sacred," "seemed to lean in") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV control is clean with stable third-limited switches at paragraph breaks; no head-hopping within beats. Elara's perceptual signature (texture, scent, symbolic placement transcending color) is distinct and consistent. Kael's focalization emphasizes shape, light, and his glassblowing craft. Dialogue feels purposeful: "Silence is a space. Your breath, shaped by glassblowing, can awaken its song." However, both characters occasionally speak in the same elevated, aphoristic register ("Each bubble is a story. It is beautiful because it is true"), reducing voice distinction under emotional pressure. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "innocently cunning" as narratorial assertion rather than shown behavior slip toward filter-explanation. The prose modulates appropriately with the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV focalization holds cleanly and the perceptual signature is consistent: "powerfully gentle" filtering and attention to shadow, light, and texture. Dialogue carries subtext in Elara's questioning of assumptions, though Dr. Aris's lines are functional rather than distinct. However, repeated diction—"powerfully gentle" appears three times, "golden shadows" six times—creates a templated cadence, and the prose leans on filter verbs ("she murmured," "she whispered," "she questioned") that dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent (jeweler's precision, grief-tinged observation). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("subdued ardor," "curtains of intention," "timeless sanctuary suspended between memory and sky") that feels more authorial than character-rooted, especially given Elara's embodied craft focus. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, but the voice lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would distinguish Elara's interior lens from generic literary narration.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elara; Leo's interiority is accessed only through visible reaction. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "tactile renaissance"), though elevated register occasionally drifts ("symbolic distance between societal waypoints"). Dialogue is spare and functional; Leo's "I feel so lost" and Elara's invitations carry subtext of shared grief and mentorship. One micro slip: "Her steadily curious nature was the quiet engine" tells rather than dramatizes the trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable and Elara's perceptual filter is scholarly (gloved finger, "fragmented scrolls," professional focus on ritual mechanics). Under peak pressure the voice holds, but diction remains uniformly elevated ("profound love...warring with its catastrophic consequence") without the compression or rhythm shift that stress would impose. Micro-deduction: several beats recycle the stem "She [verb], and..." which flattens syntactic variety. No dialogue, so those bullets are inapplicable. The saffron-veil motif bookends cleanly but the interior lexicon does not shift across emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") is character-specific. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register—"luminous regret," "sacred necessity," "bittersweet understanding"—that feels authorial rather than Elara's natural idiom under stress. Psychic distance wavers: the narrator alternates between close ("With a breath of surrender") and expository ("Her role transformed; she was no longer..."). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she witnessed") stack in the archive sequence without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable first-person-limited (Elara), distance consistent. Perceptual signature is present—lavender, barn owl, hearth crackle—but diction drifts into elevated register during peak reflection: "sacred synthesis," "transmuted into a clearer alloy," "shimmering stillness." These phrases feel authorial rather than grounded in Elara's voice as a wildlife handler. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains tense, but the syntactic uniformity (declarative sentences beginning with "She") and the therapeutic self-awareness ("My compassion was not the vulnerability; his malice was the weapon") flatten the voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric register (e.g., "meteor hush," "glacial slowness," "fractal lacework"). Diction is elevated but consistent; no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions feel polished but generic, and the vocabulary ("verdant wave of thought," "reverent attention") trends toward a uniform literary idiom rather than Elara's embodied particularity. Filter verbs ("her gaze found," "her eyes drifted") appear but do not dull urgency in this accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with purposeful psychic proximity: close during the vision, slightly elevated in framing paragraphs. Perceptual signature is strong—spatial metaphors, crystal-gazer idiom, emotional landscapes. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("braille of lost time," "chemical grains"). However, some phrasing drifts toward elevated register ("irrevocably changed," "universal truth") that risks distance from lived perception, and the busker's lyrics arriving as direct thematic echo ("love that sets you free") feels convenient rather than earned through Elara's filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and elevated throughout, consistent with a moonstruck dreamer's register. However, diction frequently drifts into generic poetic language ("fragile flame against the vast darkness," "exquisite fusion of sorrow and joy") that could apply to any reflective protagonist, and perceptual signature is not character-particular. The attribute "hears unspoken words" is asserted in narration but not dramatized through distinct idiom or syntax that would make Elara's way of noticing selective and biased. Under peak emotional pressure (tears, catharsis), vocabulary remains uniformly elevated and abstract rather than compressing or fragmenting. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the post-apocalyptic mysticism. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical register ("quantum fabric," "interference patterns") without concrete anchoring, and peak beats rely on stock mystical phrasing ("necessary emptiness," "resonant intent"). Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated—descriptions lean toward generic poetic rather than character-specific noticing. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator's certainty about future children (line 332) reads as wishful projection rather than knowledge the POV can plausibly claim.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable and third-limited throughout. Diction carries a consistent meditative register, but voice does not modulate under pressure—Kael's perceptual signature is uniform whether observing copper pines or experiencing "triumphant chord." Register occasionally drifts into workshop phrasing ("collaborative dance," "conscious cartographer of consciousness") that sits outside the established idiom. Psychic distance stays fixed; no purposeful compression or rhythmic shift marks peak moments. Perceptual filter is vague ("gentle loosening of misunderstanding's knots") rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited holds Elara's POV without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and uniform ("liminal path," "sacred meander," "indigo and silver") throughout, creating a tonal wash that does not modulate under pressure. The elder guide's dialogue and narrative voice converge in lyric register, blurring distinction. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Elara notices beauty and wisdom without bias or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a consistent register mixing lyric elevation ("seraphically mundane," "landscape of mending nerves") with concrete action. Kael's remembered voice is brief and serves to charge the bolt's meaning. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("burning motivation," "sacred intent") that feels imposed rather than voice-rooted. The perceptual signature is selective (geometric precision, acoustic awareness) but could be more idiosyncratic. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person distance is stable, and elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "void-space," "crystallized memory") establishes a consistent mythic register. However, the voice leans toward catalog and summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Kael's interiority is reported across epochs rather than filtered through a single urgent moment. The prose remains legible but lacks the perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation that would charge peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close ("quiet, persistent ache") to distant lyric sweep ("periodically eternal"). Diction remains controlled: "skeletal structure of recycled polymer," "chemical whispers guiding coral larvae." The prose carries a distinct textural signature—elegiac, precise—and free indirect style is clean. One register slip: "Submersion was secondary; the silence was primary" reads as authorial thesis rather than Elara's voice. Elision of the failsafe's encoding is purposeful but unearned, slightly undermining POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices cold permacrete, glittering tears of tools, moss on granite. Diction remains mostly controlled, though occasional elevated phrases ("monumental decay," "tangible wave that cleansed") drift slightly above a mechanic's lexicon under peak pressure. The piece uses purposeful compression and lyric patterning (parallelism, fragment-like clauses) that remain legible. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice occasionally tilts toward committee lyricism rather than a singular mechanic's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries insurgent and elder registers ("scoffed softly," "counterpoint to bubbling waters") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vindication," "insurgent conviction") that feels asserted rather than embodied. Dialogue with Kaela is brief and goal-driven, advancing theme without excess exposition. Filter verbs ("felt the land exhale") are acceptable within the telepathic frame. One slip: "Stories wait for readers with intent" reads more authorial than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature—botanical detail, somatic specificity—distinguishes the voice. Diction occasionally drifts into therapeutic register ("somatic markers," "realistically anchored optimism") that feels prescriptive rather than character-native. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between crisis and calm, though the final paragraph's rhythm flattens into declarative summary rather than sustaining the sensory texture that charged earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent. Voice carries a lyric register ("bittersweet truth," "eternal dance of warning and wonder") that fits the tone but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("luminescent ache," "self-compassion") not fully grounded in Kael's artist lexicon. The two rhetorical questions read as interiority but feel slightly performative rather than urgent thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—artist's eye seeing "composition awaiting compassionate hands"—but the diction in the cellar scene trends generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable, and Kael's perceptual signature (tracker instincts, attention to grooves and patterns) is consistent. Diction fits his consciously wild ethos. However, elevated register occasionally intrudes: "cognitive anchors," "temporal coordinates," "subjective stretch" feel abstract and academic during peak beats rather than embodied through Kael's lived lexicon. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "serene anger crystallized into razor focus" leans toward telling. Rhythmic control is solid, with sentence variation supporting the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, but diction elevates into abstraction at key beats: "the human imperative to shatter a silence," "the fragile thread of hope," "the profound, dizzying quiet." These phrases read as imposed literary register rather than Elara's perceptual signature under stress. Dialogue with Kael is functional and voice-distinct ("Sensors detected activity. Report" versus Elara's calm deflection). The prose modulates with urgency (short bursts when Kael arrives) but loses specificity in reflective stretches. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization on Elara. Perceptual signature is present (noticing silver hue, petal chime) but remains generic rather than idiosyncratically biased. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though elevated lyricism ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") repeats without evolving meaning. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor register drift: "senselessly perceptive" and "profound engraved quiet" edge toward abstract rather than the focalizer's lived lexicon under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is distinct: Elara's cool-headed filter shapes what is noticed (calm nimbus, precise zigzag). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in metaphoric language ("feral lullaby," "voicing silence"). Minor slips: "profound attribute" and "boundless compassion" drift toward elevated abstraction not fully grounded in Elara's lexicon under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally at the vortex. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Elara's perceptual signature—"devotedly observant gaze," focus on logical contradictions—is consistent. Diction mostly fits an educated heiress ("covenant with truth," "elegant reason"), though occasional phrases like "orbits of regret" and "solemn playfulness" repeat as thematic markers rather than varying idiomatically under pressure. The prose maintains distance control without head-hopping. However, register occasionally tilts toward summary exposition ("These orbits of regret...converged in this echoing room like silent comets") where scene pressure should dominate, and the grandfather's journal voice ("My dearest Elara, if you read this...") feels slightly too polished for a final confession under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (ink-stained fingers, constellation mapping) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction is lyric and elevated throughout, with phrases like "meteor hush" and "sticky resin capturing the wasp's final beat" that read as poetic rather than character-filtered. Under peak stress (the humming climax), the prose remains ornate and distanced rather than compressing into urgency. Filter verbs ("she saw") are used purposefully in the time-tapestry vision, so no penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through Elara's socially perceptive artist lens. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("interject into the grotto's monologue of letting go, not with noise, but with sacred geometry"). Distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the tile discovery, more reflective during the mandala's construction. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("not erasure, but alchemy, turning the lead of pain into the gold of wisdom"). One minor slip: "soft sensory unease that clung to the skin like a half-remembered sorrow" in paragraph three reads slightly detached from Elara's immediate embodied experience, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with psychic distance close enough to register Elara's reverent deliberation and the tessera's anchoring function. Diction is elevated and poetic—"powdered bone," "cauldron empathy in arms of steel"—consistent throughout, though certain phrases ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy incarnate") drift toward prompt-label phrasing that slightly distances the reader from immediate perception. The perceptual signature is selective and consistent: Elara notices voids, patterns, and the plaza's "hidden language." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; compression and lyricism remain legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person close on Elara with consistent synesthetic filter, but the voice converges toward elevated diction ("profound hush," "labyrinthine," "coalesced") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is vivid (threads, tastes, textures) yet formulaic across beats—each echo described via color/sense pairing without variation under pressure. No dialogue appears. Distance control is clean, but the prose reads as poeticized narration rather than Elara's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she felt") are sparse and acceptable. Psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara, and the two lines of dialogue from Maya carry goal and subtext. However, diction oscillates between embodied immediacy ("fingertips tingled," "cool ripple along her jawline") and clinical abstraction ("somatic markers," "fractally precise," "somatic resonance," "telepathy pill trial") that does not read as Elara's natural lexicon under pressure. The phrase "willowglass hope" appears multiple times but is never anchored in Elara's prior experience or thought process, reading as authorial coinage rather than character voice. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but the closing paragraph's tone ("fragile as spun sugar, yet strong enough") shifts into lyric summary that distances from Elara's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, blending lyric compression ("a labyrinth of stone and memory") with concrete action. Psychic distance remains stable in close third throughout. However, several lines drift into elevated register that clashes with immediate perception: "factually mystical, not myth" reads as authorial gloss rather than Elara's thought, and "Pre-hibernation science had irrefutably documented" carries exposition weight inconsistent with her embodied focus. Filter verbs ("she perceived," "she felt") appear in clusters during the grotto beat without adding urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with controlled psychic distance and a consistent elevated register ("petrified-wood bench," "honeyed gloom," "unearthed silence"). Perceptual signature is职业-filtered (hourglass turner's attention to time, sands, ritual) but vocabulary uniformity—nearly every paragraph opens with lyric compression or symbolic noun phrase—creates a rhythmic template that flattens peaks and valleys. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, though the prose leans heavily on metaphor density that risks obscuring immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a lyric register ("silver hush," "zephyr's whisper," "fragile thread of self") that matches Elias's reflective state. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You always favored messages that couldn't be held against you"; "The earth is tilting. Spring will come."), with subtext present but not deeply goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices mist, moss, symbols—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("sacred solitude," "vessel of intention") that feel authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The voice modulates from solitude to shared moment, yet the final lines' parallel constructions ("not a destination, but a direction—the tilt of the earth, the tilt of a heart") read slightly programmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Silas's perceptual signature ("closely attentive," mnemonic anchoring, sensory quietude) is consistent. The prose modulates appropriately between memory and present sensory detail. However, elevated diction ("palimpsest," "spindrift serenity," "percolate," "ambient awareness") saturates the voice with a uniformly lyric register that feels imposed rather than emerging from a coachman's idiom under stress. The ferryman's "slow, knowing nod" and Silas's internal voice both carry the same cadence, reducing distinctness. No dialogue present to test naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (potter's tactile awareness: "centering clay," "struck clay bell"). Diction is elevated and controlled, with purposeful lyricism ("bruised twilight," "ochre waves"). Minor register drift: phrases like "phototropic to kindness," "temporal roots," and "fractured timelines coexisted" read closer to prompt exposition than Kael's grounded craftsman voice under pressure, slightly diluting character-specific texture at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (Elara's attention to overlooked beauty, her pragmatic tenderness). However, diction repeatedly elevates into quasi-poetic register ("sacred threshold," "quivering hush," "profound quivering hush") that feels imposed rather than organically filtered through a gardener's mind. Free indirect style is clean, and the brief exchange with Mateo (a wordless gasp and lifted face) is effective, but the prose leans heavily on abstract emotional labels throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with clear psychic distance. Diction is elevated and consistent ("wind-scoured terrace," "boundless cloud sea," "atomically reflective sheen") but occasionally tilts toward ornamental register ("exquisitely fragile," "purposeful stewardship") that smooths emotional peaks. Perceptual signature is present (librarian-keeper filter) though not strongly idiosyncratic. No dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Compression at the memory immersion beat ("she was Kaelen again") serves pressure without obscuring focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Elara's perceptual signature evident in poetic, spiritualized diction ("prismatic quiet," "luminous web," "silent, shimmering truth"). The voice is distinct and consistent, modulating from solitary introspection to witnessing collective transformation. However, the elevated register is uniform across all pressure levels, lacking syntactic or rhythmic compression during the key creative act or final choice. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she witnessed," "she recognized") appear frequently but serve the contemplative mode without dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Aris with no head-hopping. Diction is generally consistent, though elevated register ("celestial puppeteers," "frequency of empathy woven from celestial mathematics") occasionally clashes with the scientist's tacit pragmatism. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Aris's noticing is filtered by occupation yet not character-particular. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("knew," "allowed himself") are sparse and acceptable. Psychic distance remains mid-close throughout; no purposeful modulation under pressure. Voice is readable but lacks rhythmic control or syntactic variety that would reflect stress at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices stone textures, geometry, and inherited tools (grandfather's compass). Diction remains mostly controlled, though occasional elevated phrases ("spatial mutiny," "liquid light," "wistful rebellion") drift above the POV's earned register without clear voice motivation. Under peak stress the prose compresses appropriately ("Panic clawed at her throat"). However, the narration over-explains at key beats: "this was wistful rebellion made manifest" tells what the scene has already shown. No dialogue present to evaluate. The voice reads more literary-omniscient than character-particular, especially in abstract framings like "dialogue across centuries."

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Elara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows her tactile focus ("fingers, trained to read texture over expression") and method. Diction remains controlled except for one slip into elevated register—"lance the moss away—a precise, piercing motion to unveil what time had buried"—where "unveil what time had buried" reads more authorial than character-particular. The prose reflects her methodical mind, and interior voice stays coherent under pressure, though some phrases ("her core motivation crystallize") feel slightly outside her lived lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Diction carries purpose ("spongey dread," "mournful sea shanties"), and perceptual signature filters the station through Elara's archival lens. The technician's brief dialogue ("All personnel, evacuate to the ridge! Now!") feels functional but generic. Elara's whispered realization ("The deep remembers its anger") charges the discovery beat, though some lines ("nervously confident urgency") lean toward label rather than enacted tension.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register. However, diction frequently drifts into prompt-echo abstractions ("dynamically observant," "pixelated amnesty," "sculpt possibility") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is more authorial-thematic than interior-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Perceptual signature is declared ("dynamically observant") but not dramatized through distinct noticing habits.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Leo. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw") appear frequently in reflective passages. Dialogue between Leo and Kai is goal-driven and naturalistic, with subtext in Leo's pedagogical calm versus Kai's earnest idealism; however, both voices share elevated diction and similar syntactic rhythm under pressure, reducing distinctness. The prose carries a measured, slightly formal texture that fits Leo's reflective stance but occasionally slips into expository cadence ("crystalline clarity," "unshakable polished calm") that flattens immediacy. No head-hopping; distance modulation is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (scholar's attention to glyphs, celestial patterns, aged paper) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the telegram revelation, pulling back slightly for the final chronicle-writing). However, diction drifts toward elevated, thesis-like register in reflective passages ("the burden was never meant for one pair of eyes," "a covenant of shared burdens") that feel more authorial than character-particular. Thomas's brief dialogue is functional but generic. No head-hopping or tense slips occur, and the narrative stance supports the midnight-solace tone, but the prose at peak moments leans abstract rather than sensorially immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated, poetic diction: "malevolent grace," "fortress of her own spirit," "warlike serenity." Diction remains consistent but does not modulate under pressure; the syntax and rhythm hold the same lyric register from opening to closure without compression or variation that reflects urgency. Free indirect style is clean. The narrator's lexicon stays within a fantasy-archaic register ("druid," "scrying," "ancient chant") that fits the setting, yet the voice reads more as authored lyricism than as Elara's particular way of noticing. Psychic distance is controlled, and no filter-verb stacks appear. The piece avoids dialogue, so no voice-distinction test applies. Voice is purposeful and legible but lacks the rhythmic variation and perceptual specificity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—"purposefully curious," filtering through scars—provides some distinctness. Diction escalates purposefully at moments ("liquid twilight," "spider-silk whisper"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure: "anxious elation," "root-bound devotion," "abiding peace" recur as labels rather than embodied perception. Stock phrases accumulate ("tears welled," "heart now a steady compass," "steps light") that flatten voice specificity. The alignment song and whispered "Heed the scars" hint at ritual texture but are not developed enough to charge the voice with unique idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Kael, with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("trammel," "dusky resolve," "covenant") that remains coherent. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poetic phrasing ("fiercely gentle net of authentic remorse") that feels less like Kael's lived perception and more like external narration imposing meaning. Perceptual signature is present—Kael sees "sacred geometry in root spirals," "elegies in dripping water"—but the texture is uniform and does not degrade under stress. The single line of dialogue ("Elara, I bring what remains of my folly") and whispered recollections feel natural, yet the overall voice leans toward lyric description rather than embodied thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV (Leo) with stable focalization and consistent filter verbs ("his gaze drifted," "he closed his eyes"). The prose has moments of distinct texture ("the scratch of nib on paper was a small, certain sound") but also relies on stock metaphors ("tidal wave of shame," "bricks in a wall") and therapeutic register ("confidently uncertain," "echo valley longing") that drift from Leo's roadie/appraiser idiom. The extended Akron memory stays within Leo's experiential lexicon, but the reflective summary in the final third flattens into essayistic summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully (close interior at grief moments, slightly wider for technical observations). Perceptual signature is character-specific: cuneiform translator's analogical leap, professional documentation habit, Akkadian whisper. Diction mostly fits Aris's register, though "touching distance" as a phrase recurs in narration and may read slightly imposed. No dialogue present. Minor issue: some lines ("sharp edges of grief rounding into purpose," "a gardener of hope above the clouds") elevate into poetic summary that slightly distances from Aris's immediate perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is lyric and controlled: "sediment in still water," "glacial grace," "moon-silk pouch." Perceptual signature is present but general—Elara notices beauty and meaning without the idiosyncratic bias that would sharpen her lens. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("perpetual present where yesterday's echoes swirled") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to assess. Compression is purposeful and the pattern is taught early, maintaining legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (inspector's eyes spotting hairline fractures, measuring life in blast-door tolerances) is established early and colors later observations. Register remains elevated and lyric-consistent, matching the contemplative cathedral atmosphere. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract formulations ("abandoned hopes of every sorrowful soul," "illusion of separation") that feel more like thematic annotation than Elias's working vocabulary under pressure, creating minor distance-control slips in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV remains stable with Elara's river-chronicler lens filtering perception throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "textures, gradients, emotional sediment," "eyes trained to read riverbeds" applied to human traces. Diction control is strong under pressure—"daringly methodical," "map references," "watershed"—maintaining professional idiom without academic drift. One slip: "raw solace" appears as authorial label in the final paragraphs rather than emerging through image. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from tight observation to reflective synthesis. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style remains clean with consistent past tense and controlled filter use.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent—elevated, lyrical—and the perceptual signature ("cautious exuberance," "gossamer veil," "breath-held pause") is character-specific. However, diction remains uniform under pressure; no syntactic or rhythmic modulation reflects urgency when Elara begins to write her apology. Filter verbs ("understood," "saw," "felt") cluster in high-stakes lines without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The narrator's interiority reads as exposition ("the true motivation had always been deeper") rather than dramatized perception. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("verdant sorrow," "perforated destiny"), consistent with the velvet-observatory register, though some phrases ("propagate the last dormant seed of its extinct kin") drift toward elevated botany-speak that feels less like Elara's lived idiom and more like authorial exposition. The mulberry's telepathic voice is distinct ("*The inner light fades*," "*Now*"), adding textural separation. Psychic distance is controlled, but filter verbs ("she recalled," "she knew then") are acceptable here as they anchor reflection. Perceptual signature is present (plant-attuned senses hear the seed pod "pop"), but under peak stress the prose does not compress—sentence rhythm remains steady rather than fragmenting or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—"galaxies in nerve impulses, rivers in slowing pulses"—is distinct and filtering. However, elevated diction ("congealed into ancient stone," "radiant hush," "spun glass") saturates most sentences, creating register drift that sits above a beautician mortician's plausible internal lexicon. The prose reads more like lyric omniscience than embodied focalization under pressure, flattening Elara's voice into ceremonial uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose establishes a distinct lyric register with controlled diction and rhythm. No dialogue appears. However, elevated constructions—"the earth itself was holding its breath in reverence," "rich tapestry woven with the whispers of ancestors"—pervade even peak ritual beats, creating a uniform poetic distance that occasionally obscures the immediacy of Elara's embodied experience. Focalization remains stable within a single POV. The voice is consistent but verges on over-literariness where plainness might sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with Kael as the focalizer, filtered through his perceptions of Elara's method and his own artifacts. Voice carries a literary register with purposeful compression ("conscience for hire by solemn vocation") and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional beats. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—Elara's deflections and Kael's resistance—though some lines ("The wind composes a new song each breath") lean slightly aphoristic. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens appropriately at the peak moment of unhooking.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a consistent lyric-philosophical register. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("marrow," "liquid silver," "temporal layer"). No head-hopping. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("delayed revelation he had guarded," "translation, not annihilation") that risks academic distance rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance remains intentional and serves the meditative tone. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV, third-person limited, stable and apt. Perceptual signature is present—Corbin sees "libraries" in bone, "sacred page[s]" in dust—but the prose often elevates into lyric register ("whispers layered through centuries," "chorus of memory") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood") occasionally dull immediacy. No dialogue. Diction remains within a contemplative-mystical register throughout, which fits the concept but offers limited modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature filters the world through craft and care ("ink-stained fingers," "weight of a sun-warmed river stone"). Diction is elevated and lyric ("brilliant dimness," "luminous haze," "mercury-waterfalls") but consistent with the voice, avoiding mid-beat register drift. No dialogue appears; interiority is conveyed through action and image rather than explicit thought. Psychic distance stays close without filter clutter. One weak spot: recycled syntactic stems in the middle section ("As she unstrapped… Then… She poured… As she unstrapped…") create template cadence that flattens momentum slightly, though the pattern serves the ritual rhythm of the unstrapping sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent perceptual filters (Elias's lamplighter precision, grief-anchored attention to light and color). Diction is elevated and lyric but mostly coherent with the reflective, mourning tone. However, phrasing occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("cathedral of drowned knowledge," "cascade of liquid topaz") that reads more decorative than voice-specific. The final paragraph's syntax ("a conscious continuation of light—a quiet promise kept") leans toward thematic summary rather than embodied perception under stress. No dialogue present; interiority is clean but leans abstract at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.2)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a distinct meditative register. However, diction is repetitive and elevated throughout: "wavelength align," "stellar doubt," "quiet enthusiasm," "distill meaning" recur as labels rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance remains wide even during the coin-casting peak beat; no compression or urgency modulates the voice. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") are frequent and flatten immediacy. The piece maintains internal consistency but lacks perceptual signature or rhythm variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (shadow, echoes, insubstantial fingers). The prose maintains elevated diction appropriate to the reaper's timeless perspective. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("vibration only his unique attribute could perceive") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The phonograph voices provide dialogue-adjacent text that advances plot without requiring naturalism. Elara's recorded phrases carry subtext and goal-driven pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy, though some moments rely on telling ("His motivation crystallized with painful clarity") rather than showing through action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in her attention to drip rates and her journals, but syntactic variety is limited—many sentences open with "She" or "Her" and follow similar declarative rhythms. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("plausible impossibility," "cosmic imbalance," "ontological question") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a "lukewarm mage" whose strongest spell warms soup. Purposeful compression in the climax ("drip-drip-drip," "beneath the viaduct, a single ripple") works, but the voice lacks a distinct idiolect or perceptual quirk that would differentiate Elara's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, distance is consistent, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven, with perceptual signature ("she felt the absence of sound like a shift in atmospheric pressure"). However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("forging a tangible bridge between image and object, past and present") in ways that feel more essayistic than character-particular under stress. The prose maintains texture and rhythm; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("orchard's timeless calm," "liquid prism," "fragile breath") that reads voice-motivated for an alchemist narrator. However, perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing doesn't shift under pressure, and her internal lexicon includes therapy-speak phrases ("harmonize," "unity," "fracture") that flatten specificity. Sentence rhythm is controlled but tends toward uniform lyric cadence without modulation at peak beats. Free indirect interiority is clean, and no filter-verb stacks appear. The prose maintains voice coherence but lacks the rhythmic intensification or perceptual narrowing expected under crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is stable and distinct, with a lyric compression ("cumulative" annotations aside) that suits the solitary watcher's focused interiority. The perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices starlight refraction, vine angles, and celestial patterns with professional selectivity. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The brief radio exchange with Vance provides contrast without voice contamination. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "soundless echo of resolution" and "reaffirmed trust," which edge toward abstraction, but overall diction remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature leans abstract ("hard-won clarity," "spacious awareness unburdened by past selves") rather than character-particular. Diction often elevates into essay register ("authentic vivification," "compassionate integration," "midwife life from loss") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The spoken line "I am the silence after the storm" reads as thematic statement rather than goal-driven dialogue. No head-hopping, but the prose lacks embodied texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias; distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and metaphor-dense throughout ("mechanical dragon," "weathered thread woven into the wind"), which reads as voice-motivated but compresses under pressure rather than modulating. The prose maintains a singular, mournful register that fits the concept but sacrifices perceptual variety: Elias's way of noticing feels lyric-universal rather than character-particular. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—"sharp as tearing vellum," "like the gentle closing of a cherished book"—that reflects the library guardian's idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the climax. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts into exposition ("the very boundaries of light the guardian observed with reverent attention," "a liminal state where time dissolved") that feels more authorial than character-bound, and the final paragraphs' declarative certainty ("It understood true guardianship") flattens the earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent access to Elara's interiority. Perceptual signature is present ("stoically sensitive nature perceived the faint, dormant song") but relies on elevated diction throughout high-pressure beats—"compassionate creation," "unwavering light," "cradle of beginnings"—creating register drift that clashes with the grit of soot-stained fingers and desperate labor. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, but free-indirect style occasionally slips into narrator commentary ("a masterpiece where destruction had midwifed authentic creation") that sounds more essayistic than character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-distinct, though some phrases ("serenely electric," "fantasy practicality") feel more like prompt echoes than organic character perception. The narrative certainty matches Elara's expertise, and perceptual filtering is consistent (e.g., "scent of ozone and aged wood"). Under peak pressure, syntax compresses appropriately. However, recurring constructions ("She had…," "She would…") and a few exposition-heavy lines ("For thirty years…") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Leo; no head-hopping. Distance is controlled, and diction is elevated but consistent (though "resiliently positive" and "starlit clarity" read slightly generic). Perceptual signature is present in Leo's maritime idiom ("fender," "hull," "sea shanty") and calm focus. The prose modulates with scene pressure (short bursts during anomaly, longer reflection in grotto). However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("watched," "understood," "saw"), and emotional interiority leans abstract ("motivation crystallized," "focused resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. No dialogue appears; the lone "Mayday" call is functional but does not carry subtext or advance character.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature reflects Elara's craft vocabulary ("converging spirals," "interlocking lines," "harmonic hum"), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to rational enchantment," "symphony of sensations") that flattens immediacy during peak beats. Free indirect style is clean; tense is consistent. The prose reflects her analytical stance early and modulates toward sensory immersion during the eruption, but the final paragraph recaps her understanding rather than trusting the dramatized shift. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Diction periodically drifts into elevated register—"embodied balancedly curious resolve," "Resonant Reconfiguration"—that clashes with scene urgency and reads as imposed rather than voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Lyra's question and Kael's answers advance the demonstration without subtext or character-specific idiom. The prose carries a uniform meditative cadence that does not modulate under the demonstration's pressure, flattening the perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "saw") appear frequently but do not obscure immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is profession-inflected (tracing pulses, listening for resonances). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though elevated ("profound reeling hush," "spider silk," "pearlescent light") in ways that occasionally drift from Elara's workday interiority. Elara's dialogue to Lily is purposeful and goal-driven ("your grandfather left you a message…"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose maintains consistent psychic distance, but the final two paragraphs shift into summary omniscience ("heroism was never a grand gesture") that blurs focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, filtering all sensory detail and emotional progression through Aris's experience. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices electromagnetic ghosts, alchemical symbols, the gold's pulse—though vocabulary occasionally elevates beyond plausible register ("Phase Transition Array," "alchemical marvel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during claustrophobic beats, pulling back for the Array's cathedral reveal. Prose rhythm reflects state: short breaths during descent, expanded syntax at the revelation. Slight register drift in technical terminology ("inducing a rapid phase transition to crystallize invisible cable data") reads more authorial than character-bound in peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is stable and the perceptual signature—counting heartbeats, opal-veined paper, "midnight solace"—remains coherent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "systemic negligence," "defragmentation") that exceeds the interiority's grounding. No dialogue present; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent but the syntax in high-pressure beats (ink ritual) does not compress or accelerate; rhythm remains uniform. No purposeful elision or compression serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Elara's tactile and auditory priorities. Perceptual signature is present—"copper-veined fingertips," "quietly articulate voice," "the texture of wind-scoured stone, deep river water, and ancestral memory"—but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated, generalizing register ("the weight of centuries," "ephemeral dance of birds," "testament written in sound and bone") that reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final paragraphs summarize closure ("Her work was done") rather than sustaining embodied immediacy through the act of placing the diamond and departing. The prose has rhythmic intent, but the narrative stance leans toward poetic declaration rather than lived interiority at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Aris throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific—Aris's scientist lens could be sharper. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gravitationally playful," "cathedral of roots") that feels more authorial than filtered through a disgraced academic's stress. The dialogue (Elara, Lyra) is sparse but functional; Lyra's final whisper carries subtext. Elision and purposeful compression are minimal; the piece reads straightforwardly, with no taught pattern to leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction remains consistent—poetic, slightly elevated ("tarnished wonder," "sky-bridge violinist"). However, the voice lacks a strong perceptual signature: Elara's way of noticing reads generically lyrical rather than character-specific. The final paragraphs slip toward interpretive summary ("She understood then") that tells the theme rather than trusting the image. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens during the uprooting but the rhythm doesn't degrade under stress, missing an opportunity for voice modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Perceptual signature is present (he notices absences, silences, dark windows) but the prose often elevates into poetic register ("drank the twilight," "liquid sapphire," "fragile electricity of possibility") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Diction stays consistent within the elevated register, yet under peak pressure (uncorking the bottle, launching the drone) the syntax does not compress or shift—rhythm remains uniform and lyric rather than modulating with urgency. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Filter verbs and free indirect style are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance. Narrative voice is lyric and controlled: "hands that spoke fluently in wood grain," "ghost of calliope music in stillness." Diction is elevated but consistent, matching the meditative register. Free indirect style is clean in memory and reflection. No dialogue, so voice distinction does not apply. Perceptual signature is present: Elara sees "potential in the peeling paint" and hears "blueprint for renewal in abandonment." Purposeful compression in metaphor ("voice a sealed chamber," "misting hush felt different") supports atmosphere. One minor slip: "a warm shroud" in the penultimate sequence mixes comfort/death imagery without clear purpose. Rhythm modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to active peak (singing) to reflective close.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization on Elara. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("sanely eccentric," "rational poetry of order") that fits the librarian's scholarly milieu and remains consistent under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the scarf-alignment beat (lines 109–114), intimate during the memory immersion (lines 128–176). The grandmother's dialogue at lines 151–169 and 176 reads voice-distinct (formal, instructive cadence) and advances theme through metaphor. Minor friction: a few filter verbs ("observed," "focused") in peak moments (lines 29, 109) slightly dull immediacy, and the final paragraph's diction ("living atlas of connection") tilts toward thematic label rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable and controlled. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the turret sequence ("Heart steady"), wider for framing ("islanders called the hush of improbable beginnings"). Diction is consistent, lyric without excessive ornament, and character-particular (cipher, vitalize, communion). No head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct texture: "luminous absence," "saffron for warmth, moonstone dust for clarity," "tears traced clean paths." Free indirect style is clean. However, some phrases drift toward generic poetic register ("whispering archipelago," "hush of improbable beginnings") that could belong to any lyric narrator rather than Elara's interior lexicon. Perceptual signature is present but not as idiosyncratic as the 8+ band requires. Rhythm varies naturally; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the elevated register is consistent. However, diction is uniformly ornate across all beats ("enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility," "seed of grace cast into the cosmos") without modulation under pressure, flattening the emotional arc. The locksmith's perceptual signature is generic—"calloused thumb," "weathered cheek"—and does not reveal character-specific bias. The prose reads as written-for-effect rather than filtered through a living mind. Free indirect style is absent; all interiority is narratorial summary. The voice is textured but not distinct to this character.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tightly bound to Aris's perception; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and character-appropriate ("hands-on folklorist," "shackled here by fear"). The perceptual signature is consistent: Aris notices "the grain of wood, the texture of soil," sketches fragments, and trusts tangible evidence. Elara's recovered dialogue ("Remember to be curious. Remember to look.") feels natural and purpose-driven. One minor wobble: "The chronically curious folklorist" in late paragraphs shifts slightly toward external labeling rather than maintaining internal texture under peak emotion, and the final paragraph's summarizing tone ("the fairy ring's lesson settled deep") tilts slightly away from the close sensory stance held earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV (Kael) is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices through his reflective facets ("his multiple reflections capturing her dejection from every angle"), and his interior voice blends archival patience with combative tenderness. Dialogue carries subtext (Elara's "These words are dust" performs frustration while seeking refutation; Kael's "Annotation is not erasure" instructs and reassures simultaneously). However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the established voice—"combative tenderness honed by centuries of quiet mentorship" reads as external summary rather than Kael's lived perception. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("he felt," "he watched") appear in non-critical beats without disrupting clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("verdant parapet," "liquid silver," "luminous in-between") which suits the ritualistic tone but flattens under peak pressure—"insatiably creative spirit," "profound connection to the weave" read as authorial summary rather than Elara's lived perception. Sentence rhythm is controlled but uniform; nearly every paragraph opens with declarative subject-verb, creating a measured drumbeat that does not modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature filters detail through her restorative lens (scarred fingers, surgeon's precision, the needle as familiar tool). Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasional phrases ("the interlaced hush, the core concept her grandmother's journal described") slip into expository summary mid-scene. The dialogue—Elara's whispered truths—feels purposeful and goal-driven. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the final knot. No head-hopping, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (tracing ghost rivers, reading erosion as language) and diction that reflects Elara's scholarly yet reverent stance. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. The prose modulates effectively under discovery pressure, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear. However, elevated register ("profound kinship across centuries," "whispered prayers echoing not in sound, but in enduring alignment") occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic summary, especially in reflective passages. The voice remains coherent but does not fully compress under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction fits an introspective scientist ("terminal velocity," "viscosity," "oxide and time"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to brief reflection. The snow globe ritual and tape work are filtered through Aris's perceptual bias. Two weaknesses: the phrase "sophisticated melancholy of the deep" (line 271) breaks into narrator-imposed meta-commentary, and at peak emotional beats the voice drifts into elevated abstraction ("microcosm of turmoil seeking equilibrium") that feels more authorial than character-particular under stress. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("observed," "felt," "witnessed") are voice-consistent and not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the voice carries a consistent lyric register ("vapor curled like liquid pearl," "tinkersong wonder"). Distance remains controlled; Elara's perceptual signature (counting seconds, listening for storms) is specific. However, the prose leans into elevated diction throughout ("driftingly alert awareness," "alchemy of sorrow into symbol") without modulating for pressure, creating a uniform texture that does not vary with emotional intensity. Phrases like "her motivation burned quietly" and "she had never felt more heard" tell interiority rather than embodying it through choice or sensation. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("profound affectionate detachment," "irrevocably altered") that fits the reflective, archival setting. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices alchemical glyphs, star charts, and prismatic light in character-specific ways. However, under peak emotional pressure (the diary's final entry), the diction becomes abstract and declarative ("profound affectionate detachment") rather than compressing into sharper, more immediate syntax. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual filter (meteorologist's gaze). The prose carries a consistent lyric texture and professional vocabulary. Minor slips: "dusty starlight" repeated four times without pattern-teaching; "quietly explosive" appears three times as label without embodied demonstration; the final paragraph drifts toward summary ("had proven that love persists") rather than sustaining image. Elara's dialogue feels natural and purposeful in the brief flashback.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close; psychic distance remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated texture—"hollowed by texture, not faces," "dust motes drifted like forgotten stars"—that fits Elara's artist sensibility. Perception is filtered through tactile and visual artist priorities. Weakness: occasional register drift into abstract philosophizing ("the cruel impermanence of crafted beauty," "the ultimate limit") that feels slightly external to her immediate experience under pressure. No dialogue to assess. Elision is purposeful (we don't see her painting process on-page) and supports compression.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable and Elara's voice is distinct (cartographer's discipline, treasured phrasebook, whispered translations). Diction remains consistent with minor elevation ("sociable isolation," "resonant hum"). However, the perceptual signature is generic—she notices clues without bias or selective attention shaped by flaw. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose modulates smoothly but lacks the rhythmic control or elision that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara's reverence and nostalgia (the gear assortment "felt like a heartbeat," the mentor's grip ghosted on the tool handle). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the mirror-hall threshold and during the uncapping sequence. Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent, though metaphor density ("crystalline stillness," "soft hush," "liquid silver") risks ornamental accumulation in early paragraphs. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose maintains a singular meditative rhythm without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Diction ("brambled hope," "breath of brambled hope") recurs with purpose, though "brambled" twice in close proximity risks self-echo. Dialogue carries subtext (Kael's "That rusted relic?" conveys skepticism, Lena's "Wait" shifts momentum). Elara's spectral voice ("like wind through leaves") maintains tonal consistency. Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "Her light softened, merging with the starlight" slightly elevates register at the emotional peak without disrupting clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (cosmic scale, reverent diction). Voice is distinct but leans toward elevated, lyric register throughout; under peak stress (alignment, beacon flare) the prose maintains the same cadence rather than compressing or fragmenting, which slightly flattens urgency. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she glanced") are voice-appropriate. Psychic distance is controlled. One example of register drift: "bruised awe" and "tenderized by sorrow" feel therapeutic/abstract rather than Elara's lived lexicon during action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elara; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (noting "dull gleam," "fragile dew," "emerald trail") reflects caretaker attentiveness. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("brittle vellum scrap," "tarnished brass," "blood-oath sworn over her grandfather's empty grave"). Under peak stress (assembly and whistle-blow), syntax tightens appropriately. One minor slip: "offhandedly exact precision" and "graceless yet unnervingly precise" use near-synonym phrasing to label the same trait twice without dramatizing the internal contradiction, reading as authorial assertion rather than embodied perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the chemist's perceptual signature (surfactants, fluid dynamics, polymer chains) is consistent and character-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the foam-observation beat. However, register drift into elevated diction ("poignant soundtrack," "symphonically minded nature perceived the world as composition") and template cadence ("His grief, fully loosened, became fertile ground…" / "The polymer of his life would be stronger…") flatten voice under peak pressure. No dialogue is present. The prose reads polished but occasionally slips into essayistic phrasing that distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a heightened, lyric register that remains consistent ("woven mist," "liquid shadows," "courageous choice to quantify absence"). Some diction edges toward elevated abstraction ("glimmering parole," "mindfully scattered") that sits at the upper boundary of plausible focalization for a vendor, but the voice coheres without breaks. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and purposefully heightened: "liquid sky," "bruised twilight," "emotions were emotionally contagious through touch." POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature favors culinary and tactile metaphor (flour, consommé, desert glass). Diction stays within an elevated register throughout, which supports the fable-like tone. Purposeful compression in the subsuming sequence ("he cooked the remorse") maintains coherence. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice frequently drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("profound absence that felt like a held breath," "vigorous tender chaos"). The grain elevator "dialogue" in multiple languages is reported rather than rendered, reducing immediacy. Psychic distance is inconsistent: moments of close interiority alternate with summary-level declarations of emotional state. The prose texture is lyrical but lacks the perceptual signature of Elara's professional or personal bias filtering the world.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice carries distinct diction ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie") but drifts into elevated register inconsistent with an engineer's lexicon ("synaptic plasticity," "psychic imprints"). POV distance is stable but interiority relies on exposition ("she understood that her engineering mind…") rather than perception under pressure. Free indirect style is clean but filter verbs stack in reflective passages. No dialogue to assess; perceptual signature is present but voice becomes generic in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a distinct elevated register ("clandestinely luminous," "spectral shroud," "cathedral-like cavern") that fits an archivist narrator. Perceptual signature—prism-vision decoding cartography, recognizing Fibonacci spirals—anchors the voice in Elara's expertise. Yet diction drifts into ornamental phrasing under pressure: "latent blaze," "quiet fire," "liquid stars" are generic metaphors rather than character-particular images. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she recalled") appear but do not overwhelm. No dialogue is present; interior voice is consistent but lacks syntactic variety under peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("symphonically minded soul," "fragile threshold," "intensely quiet") that reads as authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom under pressure; the diction does not degrade or shift with her tears, suggesting the voice belongs to the narrator, not the character. The phrase "after the hedgehog uncurled" recurs as a frame but feels more like a prompt anchor than organic perception. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—anyone could notice these details in this cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and Elias's perceptual filter throughout. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("tangible thrum," "fertile ground," "benediction") that fits the contemplative mode. However, the diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("discover beauty in the difficult," "translated silence") that reads more thematic than voice-particular. Under emotional peaks (tears, realization), the syntax remains controlled and uniform rather than degrading or compressing with stress, which flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (seeing "the ghost of a tear," painting throat-tightness) is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, consistent with her theatrical sincerity. Yet the prose slips into filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she perceived," "she felt") in high-pressure beats and occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("the path to empathy," "deliberate step"). The whispered dialogue to the clasp ("I am here to listen") feels performed rather than goal-driven, advancing atmosphere more than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature (olfactory focus, herbalist's priorities) is distinct and consistent. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon; no head-hopping. However, elevated phrases like "the turning of the tide's thought," "undercurrent of wisdom," and "mysterious ballet" drift toward poetic abstraction that feels imposed rather than voice-native. The grandmother's dialogue is brief but natural. Under peak stress (seed arrival, germination), syntax compresses appropriately without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Kael's perceptual signature prioritizes orchard mechanics (water flow, growth patterns) and ancestral legacy. Diction is controlled and mostly apt—"living map," "liquid veins," "phantom weight of ripe fruit." However, elevated register occasionally drifts from the POV's practical focus: "covenant," "palpable presence," "centuries of harvests" read more authorial than character-filtered. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs as a tonal anchor but remains abstract; converting sensory absence into metaphor works thematically yet sacrifices immediate embodiment. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with professional diction appropriate to Kael's aerospace background ("Venturi effect," "turbulence coefficients," "computational fluid dynamics"). Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices wind patterns, structural fatigue, resonance—filtered through investigator/engineer priorities. Rhythmic control supports pressure: short factual beats during documentation, longer reflection when he recalls the cockpit failure and examines Croft's patch. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "singular convergence was profoundly personal" and "crystallized into resolve," which edge toward abstraction not fully voice-integrated under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (synesthetic translation) is present. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("oscillating repose," "unfettering," "fertile vessel for wonder") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Elara's interior voice is generic and therapeutic ("body weary but spirit soaring," "peace settling over her") rather than idiosyncratic. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression is attempted but the effect is more decorative than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative stance is consistent, but the diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register that clashes with immediate perception—"avalanchingly quiet," "sonic architecture of resonance," "tapestry of light." Perceptual signature is present but abstracted. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance stays controlled, but the prose does not modulate under peak pressure; the register remains uniformly lyric throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in "scent of iron and ink," "topaz facets swam," "shadows deepened into chasms." Register is elevated and consistent ("visceral resonance," "the elegant calculus hidden in cadence and glyph"), fitting a literate artisan focalizer. Purposeful compression in the escalation paragraphs ("Topaz facets swam… collided… frayed") supports pressure. However, the voice occasionally drifts into meta-commentary that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("This was designed to disorient the reader"), and the final paragraphs lean on prompt terms ("transposed empathy," "deliberate ambiguity," "lucid turbulence") rather than idiom rooted in Elara's craft. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains close throughout with no unmotivated leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("jittery," tactile engagement with the pendant, sensory anchors) and diction fits the voice. The pendant's "ancient attribute" and "sympathetic resonance" introduce a slightly elevated register but remain legible within the narrator's idiom. Elara's quoted lesson ("Life persists…if you learn to hear the vibration") carries natural rhythm. However, template cadence appears in the final third: "He understood…," "He continued…," "He walked…," "The ridgeway stretched…," "And Kael…walked." This repetitive stem pattern dulls propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a mystic-scholar texture ("crystalline clarity," "charged with purpose"). Diction matches Kael's contemplative register throughout. However, elevated phrasing in peak beats—"the shifted hush," "truthful lie," "commune with humility"—reads slightly self-conscious, and the final paragraph's compression of insights risks abstract summary over embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent but more observational than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction ("profoundly wistful," "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") establishes a consistent elevated register, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("raveling silence," "time's unraveling tapestry") that reads decorative rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is present but generic—Elara notices the orchard's fade and the loom's solidity without a biased, idiosyncratic filter that reflects her craft or grief. Under peak stress (the weaving sequence), the prose maintains its lyric cadence without compression or rhythm shift to reflect urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate. Purposeful elision and compression are legible; the piece teaches its pattern early and holds it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature (soot-stained hands, meek blacksmith's habitual quietness) is established early. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with azure imagery and patterned diction ("coax," "deliberate," "tempered"). However, under peak stress (ritual beat), diction elevates into decorative register ("threads swirling like liquid starlight," "gentle, insistent strength") that risks distancing rather than sharpening immediacy. The single line of dialogue ("From this rubble, grant us resilience") reads purposeful and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with diction that reflects Elara's sensory-mapping expertise (e.g., "cataloged," "map of absence," "topography of grace"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited. However, prompt-derived phrases like "cyclically spontaneous," "murmur of half-remembered dreams," and "withheld truth" recur as labels rather than filtering through Elara's idiosyncratic lexicon under stress. The perceptual signature is present but occasionally buried under abstract formulation, especially in peak beats where concreteness would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant," "reading subtle shifts"). Diction is controlled and fits Elias's voice (rope, oilskin, tide metaphors). However, elevated register appears frequently ("reticent," "spectral rainbows," "luminescent ache," "fierce need to bottle the feeling") and drifts above a taciturn skipper's lexicon, especially in peak beats. Free indirect style is clean, but the poetic overlay occasionally feels authored rather than character-generated, reducing immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Kael notices star-charts, crystalline facets, shadow-glyphs). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the premise's mythic tone. However, under peak stress the voice does not compress or shift—syntax remains ornate ("verdant luminescence," "bruised clouds," "white fists") when urgency might strip it. Filter verbs ("recalled," "peering down") are present but not excessive. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The piece maintains psychic distance and avoids head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices light, texture, rhythm—filtered through her dye-master lens. Diction is elevated and lyric ("valley-mist wonder," "quietly explosive," "chromatic truth"), creating a distinct texture. However, elevated register persists uniformly across beats, including peak emotional moments (tears, recognition), reducing modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("believed," "recalled") appear but remain voice-legible. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reads as purposeful lyricism, yet the uniform cadence flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries consistent elevated diction ("profound connection," "liquid silver," "luminous tapestry") that fits a literary register but occasionally drifts into abstraction under pressure ("quantified sorrow," "shared humanity") rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance remains controlled. The prose has distinct texture—lyric, formal—but the narrator's perceptual signature is more poetic than character-specific; Elara's way of noticing reads generic rather than filtered through her maintenance-worker lens. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") are acceptable and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with stable focalization through Elara's perception. Perceptual signature is lyric but generic: "shattered loom," "quiet ember," "gentle expansion of purpose fulfilled" read as elevated rather than character-specific idiom. Diction remains consistent but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture under pressure—runs of similar syntactic patterns ("Her motivation was," "Her gaze settled," "This was the core concept") flatten momentum. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is consistent, with a formal, contemplative register that fits the setting and protagonist. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider observation during the ritual. However, several phrases slip into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-particular ("enlarged tranquility," "compassionate recluse"), and the narration occasionally tells emotional conclusions ("the weight in her chest dissolved into light") rather than trusting image. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, but the voice lacks a sharp perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is consistent and lyric, with purposeful compression ("creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle precision"). However, perceptual signature is only moderately distinct—Elara's noticing could belong to any contemplative observer. Madame Lin's brief dialogue carries subtext and goal (offering comfort, honoring ritual), but the two characters' internal textures are not sharply differentiated. Under peak emotional moments (tear falling, bread breaking), diction remains elevated and somewhat uniform rather than degrading or sharpening with stress.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric-technical texture ("quartz hush," "spectral graph," "midwifed meaning") that matches the reverent, meticulous character. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices frequencies, amplitudes, textures of light. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "memory-slides," "luminous vow," and "Resonance Analyzer" feel slightly codified. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during measurement, pulling back for the final paragraphs to frame her ongoing work. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara throughout. Voice is distinct—"whisper carrying like stone on water" and "woven from shared secrets"—with purposeful lyric compression. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elara's lines at climax are declarative and authoritative, fitting her role. Minor register drift: "sonic fracture of trust breaking" (line 68) and "fragile anatomy" (line 267) feel slightly elevated beyond her embedded perspective during action. Perceptual signature is clear but could deepen under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register appropriate to the bio-engineered future and Elara's reflective nature. Psychic distance remains stable, and the perceptual signature—taste as compass, luminescence as emotional state—creates character-specific filtering. Some passages drift into expository abstraction ("empathic conduits, their emotions resonating with Earth's consciousness in a symbiotic dialogue") that briefly abandons the textured immediacy of taste and light. Diction stays within the established voice without jarring register shifts, and the final paragraphs modulate cadence effectively to match the resolution's quiet intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Elara with consistent psychic distance, and perceptual signature (artist's eye noting contour, light, grit of charcoal) anchors voice. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("phantom limb aching with absence," "alchemized into quiet, enduring hope"), fitting a grief-steeped, memory-driven frame, yet register does not modulate under peak pressure—the portrait-sketching beat and note-reading moment carry the same measured, poetic cadence as the opening, flattening urgency when syntax could tighten or fragment to reflect embodied stress. Filter verbs ("understanding washed over her," "tears streamed freely") appear at emotional peaks where concrete action or fragmented perception would sharpen immediacy, and the final paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("She would sketch… she would find") reads as summary rather than present-tense witness to the dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and Elara's perceptual bias (gilded-leaf craft, sensitivity to lies). Diction is controlled and voice-specific. Two frictions lower the score: elevated register in peak beats ("a plea for coherence," "dissolution" metaphors) occasionally drifts above the concrete sensory anchors established early, and some interiority ("The warmth of a mother's lullaby hummed in the air") tells emotion rather than filtering it through Elara's body and micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature filtered through Elara's attunement to harmonics. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the post-verbal world. Weaknesses: some filter stacks ("She recalled," "She envisioned") in peak beats dull immediacy, and phrases like "color of wonder" and "symphonies of truth" repeat without variation. The prose occasionally slips into thesis mode ("deepest truths resonate in the chest, not the throat") rather than trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Unit Seven's perceptual signature—sensor notes, "archived memories," "vocal emulator"—is consistent and android-specific. Diction is controlled, with minimal filter-verb clutter. One dialogue exchange (Lena's voice) serves character without distraction. Two frictions lower the score: repeated syntactic stems in the ritual sequence ("The plastic spider…"; "The charcoal monster…"; "The milk tooth…") create template cadence, and elevated register ("miniaturize the overwhelming weight of memory") drifts from android utility toward philosophical abstraction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady through Elara's perceptual lens, and the prose maintains a consistent lyric register ("sandstorm calm," "pressed flower," "tapestry of reconciliation"). Dialogue from Mrs. Gupta, Leo, and Mr. Henderson varies slightly in content but shares near-identical syntactic rhythm and elevated diction, reducing character distinction. The phrase "sandstorm calm—a profound stillness holding the gathering emotion at bay" exemplifies the authorial gloss that intrudes on Elara's embodied experience. Filter verbs ("she recalled," "she knew") are frequent but voice-motivated, avoiding major penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent access to Elara's interiority. Perceptual signature leans toward elevated lyricism ("sediment settling in perpetual twilight," "silent poem of resilience") that feels authorial rather than character-particular—no evidence Elara thinks in such studied metaphor under stress. Diction remains poetic throughout without modulation for urgency. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice reads as narrator-controlled rather than Elara's embodied mind.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("colossal shadow," "gleaming silence," "forests of salt crystals") that matches the story's tone. Perceptual signature is present (Elara's sailor's intuition, the coffee-ground map "etched in her mind") though somewhat generic. Purposeful compression and poetic diction are pattern-taught and sustained. However, the prose leans toward uniform poetic elevation without modulation under peak stress; the climactic exhumation beat maintains the same lyric distance as the opening harbor scene, reducing immediacy when pressure should spike.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (mapping silence as landscape) but diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") that feels ornamental rather than voice-rooted. Filter verbs ("she recognized," "she felt") cluster without serving immediacy. Elara's internal voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax and cadence remain uniform from calm to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is selective (brushing doorframes, tracing wax) and voice carries literary texture. Mrs. Davison's dialogue feels natural and purposeful. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond Elara's established register ("ephemeral," "syntax in sagging floorboards") without clear motivation, and some interiority edges toward summarizing insight rather than showing perception under pressure. Filter verbs ("saw," "understood," "knew") cluster in the final third without disrupting clarity but dulling immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (Elara's empirical skepticism "charmed into reluctant belief") is present. Diction is elevated and consistent ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "spectral determination"), but the register remains ornate even during high-pressure beats, reducing urgency. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on the page; Kael's voice is recalled in the memory, which reads as purposeful. Rhythm modulates but stays lyric-heavy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Kael throughout. Narrative distance modulates appropriately—intimate during memory beats, slightly elevated during the ritual's ceremonial turns. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent; phrases like "calibrated treason" and "pearl twilight" recur with purpose. Some lines drift toward elevated register ("metronomic patience," "liquid starlight") that fits the lyric mode but occasionally feels decorative rather than voice-rooted. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature (Kael's calligrapher's precision, his guilt-laden attention to detail), and psychic distance shifts intentionally to support the ritual's emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice has a lyric, elevated texture ("serpentine nexus," "ocean memory stranded in desert stone"), but diction is often generic-poetic rather than character-particular—Elara's perceptual signature does not shift under pressure. The final paragraph's register ("delicate, intricate webs that connect all human hearts") drifts into philosophical narration that abstracts rather than concretizes her stance, weakening the close.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: elevated, reverent diction ("liquid gold," "borrowed starlight," "woven truth") fits Elara's ghostly vocation and the shrine's sacred atmosphere. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping or filter clutter. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during the dream-dive and expands for reflection. However, syntactic uniformity (many sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrases) and a slight drift toward generic lyricism ("her spirit felt unburdened") keep the voice from full singularity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the philosopher filters setting through reverence and specificity (bone needles, hemp thread, radial symmetry). Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") that feels authorial rather than character-lived. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled. The prose reflects the focalizer's meditative stance without elision or taught pattern beyond standard narration.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present in cataloging contradictions and methodical patience. Diction remains largely controlled, though phrases like "crystalline moment" and "covenant with the future" drift toward elevated register inconsistent with observational rigor. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the reconstruction sequence. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "looked") are minimal and voice-motivated. The prose reflects urgency and focus, though a few ornamental constructions ("ochre storm scouring") slightly disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara with clear section-break switches to Oakhaven and the citadel; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. The prose carries a lyrical, prophetic texture ("a river of metaphor and memory flowing against the wind's howl") that matches Elara's visionary role and modulates with pressure—compressed, urgent when the ionosphere clears. Hemlock's "bones ached for the old ways" and Lena's "heart racing with dangerous curiosity" briefly access their interiority, yet these moments read as tightly controlled focal shifts at section breaks rather than leakage. Elara's prophetic broadcast dialogue ("When the raven's shadow crosses the silent bell") feels purposefully stylized, though it risks opacity; the payoff (willow, moss-stone) justifies the method. Minor: "gritty whimsy" as a phrase in the penultimate paragraph intrudes slightly on the established lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable (close third on the poet), and the voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, diction frequently slips into prompt-language ("positively wistful," "gleaned redemption," "lonesome splendor," "translator between generations") that reads as thematic labeling rather than the poet's idiolect under pressure. Figurative density is high but unvaried across emotional beats, and the prose does not modulate rhythm or compression when winding the music box or sealing the jar—moments that warrant tighter focus. Perceptual signature is weak; the poet's way of noticing does not feel character-specific or biased by his vagrant status or craft.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during crypt work, wider for environmental sweeps). Perceptual signature is consistent—technical precision layered with spiritual reverence—and diction matches her engineer-mystic role. However, the prose suffers from elevated register drift ("sonic absolution," "vibrational matching," "fleeting twilight") that occasionally clashes with embodied immediacy, and there is no dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "letting") are acceptable within voice but cluster in high-pressure beats without always adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable; narrative distance and tense are consistent. The prose establishes a distinct texture through elevated diction ("flawless obsidian mirror," "ethereal luminescence," "restrained wildness") that fits the ritual/mystical frame. Some filter verbs and passive constructions ("was conceived," "was her motivation," "felt a deep hum") soften immediacy in key beats. Perceptual signature is present but occasionally tips toward ornamental lyricism ("star-dusted sky," "pearl moon") rather than character-specific observation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara, and the investigative framing is consistent. However, voice is marked by register drift into elevated diction ("entangled memories," "fortified vulnerability," "fierce, fortified vulnerability," "compassionate remembrance") that feels imported rather than character-specific. The prose reads as committee consensus—polished but without Elara's perceptual signature under pressure. Purposeful compression is absent; the style remains declarative and expository throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with rhythmic control ("vibrant hush," "silent sermon"). Dialogue (68) feels natural and character-specific for Samuel. However, register occasionally drifts into literary stock phrases: "prayers through slanted light" (line 2), "soft rasp blending with the shop's gentle ticking" (135). These constructions read as authorial rather than rooted in Elias's chaplain idiom. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak beats (238), but the prose sometimes prioritizes lyricism over embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara, with a distinct whimsical-reverent texture ("Still dramatic, I see?" / "You magnificent, stubborn miracle"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally—close during the ritual, wider during the months-long elision—and the perceptual signature (gears as old philosophers, acid as corrosive critic) colors the world consistently. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peaks: "silent architecture of tomorrow's possibilities," "ephemeral beauty into steel and purpose," "pure potential." These phrases read more essayistic than character-particular, especially under the pressure of the climactic moment. Dialogue is minimal (two direct addresses to the Algorithm), natural in rhythm, and goal-free but voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance tightens during peak beats (console discovery, video log). Perceptual signature is professional but not deeply idiosyncratic—"brightly attentive" is told more than shown through syntactic or rhythmic texture. Lena's video dialogue ("you are the keeper who listens to echoes") carries subtext but borders on thematic echo. The prose modulates with pressure (short clauses during defiance, longer reflection during closure) but does not exhibit a distinct rhythmic fingerprint. Filter verbs ("she'd scoured," "she found," "she vowed") are acceptable but cluster in exposition, slightly dulling immediacy in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through the peacekeeper's "calmly intuitive" stance. The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("shadow-laced," "weighted breath before reply," "verdant green and gold") that supports the lyric-mythic tone. However, the narrator's diction at peak beats ("channeled the emotional resonance," "motivation crystallized") slides into abstract summarization that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience. The peacekeeper's perceptual signature is asserted ("bypassed the clutter, settling on three mirrors") but lacks the idiosyncratic detail—what they notice, what they ignore, how their shadow-nature colors perception—that would make the focalization feel character-particular rather than neutral observation in ornate language.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elara; distance is stable with controlled intimacy. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices texture (coarse hemp, cool porcelain, slush) and sound (ice groan, wind moan). Diction remains consistent and elevated ("windborne solace," "fold in patience") without register breaks. Dialogue is minimal (Lars: "My father's") and purposeful. Two weaknesses: "stubborn continuity" and "windborne solace" recur as thematic labels in a way that edges toward over-articulation, and the parasol tip's metaphorical charge is narrated ("no longer a relic of loss, but a compass") rather than shown through Elara's micro-choice with it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Elara with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Diction is consistent, though elevated ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") in ways that edge toward authorial rather than character voice. Dialogue from Clara and Liam feels articulate and therapeutic ("I armored my fear in criticism") rather than speech under stress. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose often tells emotional states ("Clara's tears now fell for understanding") instead of embodying them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is stable, third-person limited, with elevated diction consistent to the register. Psychic distance remains close to Kael's perception throughout. However, the prose often slips into expository summary ("His motivation flowed not from pride but reverence") and stocks of elevated abstractions ("tranquility," "reverence," "timeless flow") that flatten immediacy. Sentence rhythm is controlled but rhythmically uniform, with many clauses opening on noun-subject patterns and a recurring cadence of declaration followed by metaphorical gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single POV, consistent psychic distance, and perceptual signature (Elara's calm observation). Voice is stable and carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("alchemically transmute," "invisible threads," "earnest whimsy"). However, diction occasionally drifts into stock literary phrasing ("resilient vines," "silent keys to reconciliation") that flattens specificity. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Liam's whispered line, the boy's exclamation). Filter verbs ("observed," "witnessed") cluster in the final third without obscuring immediacy, but the prose occasionally tells rather than shows emotional shifts. No head-hopping or POV leakage; competent execution with minor register smoothness.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable with a consistent scholarly-lyric register. Psychic distance is controlled and diction suits the focalizer's reflective nature. However, several phrases—"frozen constellation," "sonic tapestry," "testifying to the library's soul"—drift into elevated, almost interchangeable poetic diction that could belong to any contemplative narrator. Under peak emotional moments (the tears, the understanding), the voice remains uniform rather than compressing or intensifying. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct texture: "the profound hush of old videotapes left unwatched, a silence thick with unlived moments." POV remains stable third-close; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (sensory echoes, ritual devotion) is consistent. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"sacred act of clinging to echoes," "cartography of devotion"—that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the chalk-marking beats, but the closing litany ("She would return…She would gather…She would arrange…") flattens into template cadence rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Diction is elevated and poetic ("sewing chaos into time itself," "vivid memory of her mentor Aris whispering"), which fits an accumulative/lyric design but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("soul's threshold," "empathetic recalibration") that abstracts rather than grounds. The prose voice is distinct and consistent, though it leans heavily on figurative constructions in almost every sentence of high-pressure beats (earthquake, spinning hand, final tears), risking density without breathing room. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt the tremor," "pondered escape velocity") are acceptable within this voice but stack noticeably in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly on Elara until brief shifts to Lena and Arthur's perceptions (Lena's tears, Arthur's smile, his whispered thanks). The narrative voice is elevated and lyric ("clouds drifted like silent rivers," "pulsing stillness") with purposeful cadence, yet diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("decisively kind heart swelling," "luminous peace") that blurs the perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse and functional, though Arthur's "I can hear her humming again" lands with naturalism and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Elara's perceptual signature—ink-stained fingers, meticulous focus on runes—is distinct. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("quietly deliberate," "corrupted instructions"). Weakness: some phrases slip into elevated abstraction ("eyes reflecting starlight," "tears tracing clean paths through dust") that feel decorative rather than character-specific, and the prose occasionally favors poetic distance over embodied immediacy under peak pressure (the rune-correction beat is cleanly executed but lacks visceral stakes).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct narrative texture: "bone-setter," "forgiving skeptic," "cartographer of grace." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament that truth resides in humble details") that feels authorial rather than Elara's working idiom. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (bone-setting metaphors, botanical details) is consistent. However, peak emotional beats (the sob of liberation, the resolve to educate) are externalized through summary rather than immediate sensation, dulling immersion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, consistent with a reflective, accumulative design. Perceptual signature is present (grandmother's lessons, Liam's fevered trust) and filters detail purposefully. However, the prose voice does not modulate under pressure—polishing, memory, and dawn carry identical rhythmic lushness. Syntax varies but leans heavily on participial phrases and clause stacking, creating a slightly mechanical cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, with a distinct textural signature ("honeyed hush," "crystalline cartography"). Psychic distance is stable throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that slightly exceeds the immediate perceptual frame ("gratted new meaning," "palpable acceptance"). No head-hopping. The prose maintains rhythmic coherence, and compression (the ritual sequence) is purposeful. One minor slip: "grafted" as verb feels slightly imported rather than organically Elara's lexicon under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the focalizer's perceptual signature—"lucidly watchful," attuned to "ephemeral cameo appearances"—is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register at key beats ("solemnized their collective existence," "the boundary between the misty nexus and his study blurred") that feels externally imposed rather than character-rooted. The narrative certainty about the novel's future success ("would find its readers") exceeds what the protagonist can plausibly know in this moment. Template cadence appears in the cameo sequence: "A crystalline child's giggle... Elara. / Moments later... Kael's cameo. / Next... Lyra's cameo" (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice contamination without duplication).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register ("profound gathering hush," "rose-gold," "palpable reverence") that remains consistent but trends toward elevated diction throughout rather than modulating with urgency. Elara's perceptual signature is generic (she "knew," she "felt," she "closed her eyes") without idiosyncratic filtering; any restorer could narrate this way. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("seemed to lean," "appeared," "felt") cluster in the final third without voice motivation, adding minor distance drag.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Elara notices soil stains, lichen, engraved roots). Diction is elevated and coherent but occasionally drifts into portentous register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("antithesis of her craft," "terrifying void promising only ash"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, and free indirect style is clean. The prose texture is distinct but risks falling into a singular lyric register that does not modulate with emotional pressure—crisis and calm share the same cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent perceptual signature (peripheral gaze, meticulous observation) anchor the voice. Diction is controlled and character-specific: "harvest of echoes," "cellar of reason," "wounded season" build a coherent idiom. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with urgent moments—lines 283 ("proving that insight often dwells at the edges of sight") and 325 veer into essayistic summary. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, and purposeful psychic distance shifts (dawn to dusk) maintain coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Voice is consistent and lyric—"shingled hush," "whalebone reverie"—but elevated diction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "granulating") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into abstract register during peak beats. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature (Elara's attention to thread angles, lamplight, ancestral memory) is selective and purposeful. Under pressure, the narration compresses into process description without losing internal texture, though some filter verbs ("she recalled," "she felt") dull immediacy when the weave intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature (craft-focused, metaphor-dense) is consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with vocabulary appropriate to a widow and artisan. However, under peak emotional pressure (the memory of Leo's scar, the kettle's whistle), the prose does not compress or shift rhythm; instead it maintains the same elevated, metaphor-laden cadence throughout. Phrases like "hauntingly practical" and "rust-hued peace" read as authorial rather than character-particular, and the lack of sentence-level modulation flattens the sense of lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Elara's "chronologically confused" mind colors her perception of time bleeding together. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the ghost encounter, wider during fragment collection). However, some diction drifts into elevated register that feels author-imposed rather than character-filtered: "radiating uneroded potential," "empathetic warmth," "compassionate understanding." The dialogue fragments (from the wheel) carry distinct voices, but Elara's interior voice occasionally smooths into therapeutic language ("I was afraid of the height of my own dream") that reads more articulate than her crisis state would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct lyrical register: "mind that found poetry in stress calculations," "whispered challenge across time," "liquid thread weaving through the stone maze." The prose modulates appropriately from quiet observation to focused labor to awed realization. Perceptual signature—engineer's eye for gradients, hydrological schematics, optimal angles—is character-specific. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("functionally creative attribute," "stoic wonder," "deep, resonant awe") that reads more like authorial framing than Elara's lived perception under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The final equation articulation feels slightly outside the established voice's grain.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature (clock-oil stains, "introverted clock scribe"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the climax. However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure ("benediction of acceptance," "liquid gold," "harmonized") that risks sounding authorial rather than character-particular for a working scribe. No dialogue to test; interior voice is lyric but occasionally generic ("warm, embracing silence").

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (focus on dissonance, micro-expressions, instincts) is character-specific. Diction stays consistent, though phrases like "architecture of lies," "serene upheaval," and "cathedral of deceit" recur without fresh variation and edge toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but several filter verbs ("she recalled," "she saw") dull immediacy during reflective beats. The transition from Thorne's study to present-tense realization is smooth, but the voice in peak reflection ("hindsight clarity arrived not as a shock, but as a gentle, inevitable tide") reads more poetic than urgent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (patient, reverent focus on tactile detail) is consistent. Diction is elevated ("embodying the attribute," "a tapestry of intentional knots") and voice-motivated for a philosophical collector. The fisherman's single speech—"The secret weavers do not guard objects"—carries natural cadence and subtext. Minor slips: register occasionally drifts toward essay ("Her motivation was a quiet urgency") and some phrasing feels template-driven ("the fog began to thin, revealing pale gold light"). Filter verbs ("She felt understanding settle") dull immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-literary register with strong perceptual signature: "twilight sealing solitude," "sorrow transforms into solace across landscapes of the soul." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("geography of healing," "silent communion") that feels more like authorial overlay than Elara's immediate perception under pressure. Kael's dialogue is distinct and grounded ("Her absence from the throne was her deepest presence here"), providing effective contrast to Elara's interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV with stable third-limited focalization and a distinct lyric register (crystalline corridors, quaking reverie, spider-silk sunrise). Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen notices beauty, memory, and symbolic resonance. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation ("ephemeral forests," "stardust blessings"), flattening urgency. Psychic distance remains constant rather than tightening under stress. The prose occasionally sacrifices immediacy for aesthetic gloss, and some phrasing ("bedraggled prince transformed by acceptance") reads as external summary rather than inhabited perception.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; distance is consistent. The voice carries lyric texture ("migration of clouds painted the sky in slow, liquid strokes") and perceptual signature (firefighter noticing obsidian formation, volcanic processes). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elara-specific ("unyielding compassion," "harmonize," "resonate"). The father's dialogue is brief and naturalistic ("it's making the join stronger than what broke"), but Elara's interiority sometimes over-articulates emotional states. Purposeful compression in the ritual sequence is legible but the narrative voice remains slightly distant, filtering emotion through abstraction rather than sharp perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she reads scars as language, sees logic in clues) but vocabulary drifts into elevated poetic register ("sidereal patience," "liquid light erupted," "symphony of gentle currents") that occasionally exceeds naturalistic focalization for this character under pressure. Diction remains lyric-consistent but some constructions feel more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled; the voice modulates at closure but the heightened lyricism pervades rather than peaks strategically. Free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual filter is consistent (stardust vibrations, translucent cheeks). Diction is elevated and voice-appropriate for the sentimentalist frame. Register stays controlled with minor slips into abstract phrasing ("troubling serenity," "persistent, careful action"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the master ping. The repeated phrase "quiet sigh of falling petals" and similar sentence stems create minor template cadence in the final third, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with controlled distance. Voice carries lyric texture ("dusk bled indigo," "heart-opening clarity") that fits the reflective tone, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unstoppable pattern of communal purpose") that reads more thematic than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (stone workshop dust, white scars of granite) but the internal narration often explains rather than shows perception degrading or shifting under pressure. No dialogue on the page; Lyra's spectral voice is narrated as resonance "within Elara's heart," avoiding head-hopping but flattening interactive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices time, texture, and ancestral legacy, filtering sensory detail through her diligent focus. Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("bruised purple sky," "incremental absolution"), though phrases like "ethically diligent nature" and "shared balance" drift toward abstract thesis language rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance shifts purposefully during the reverie (close interior vision) and pulls back for the village's response. Minor register slip: "Catastrophe of '78" and "Serpent's Teeth rocks" read as folklore idiom, but "methodology to restore shared balance" sounds like academic exposition mid-narrative. Purposeful compression in the reverie is legible and serves the mystical pause, but some sentences ("The action of emergence was clarity") read as explanatory summary rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized") is consistent and attempts lyricism, but the perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices what the plot requires, not what a gardener's eye would prioritize. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") dull immediacy in key beats. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("meticulously crafted lesson in humility") beyond the gardener's demonstrated idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric ("shard of solidified night," "sleeping giant awaiting the precise word"). Perceptual signature is consistent (reverence for natural data, precision). However, the elevated register never modulates under pressure—Elara's internal syntax remains formal even during doubt. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") appear frequently but are voice-consistent. No dialogue to judge. The prose has texture but lacks the rhythmic shift or compression that high-band entries demand.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register; perceptual signature is evident in the narrator's selective focus on ember-light, static, and the "scratch of her nib." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("solemn vow," "transient shape of an oak leaf") that risk sitting above Elara's lived lexicon during high-pressure beats. The voice is distinct and textured, yet repeated constructions ("She was," "This was," "Every") create mild syntactic monotony. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs; the narrator's certainty matches Elara's knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to working through incomplete information," "convergence into singular truth") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—she notices porcelain texture and tremor in a client's voice, but her way of filtering the world lacks idiosyncratic color. The prose carries a uniform solemnity that does not modulate with pressure or reveal Elara's distinct rhythms of thought.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (geological surveys, sedimentary strata, "abrasive calm") is character-specific and filters detail consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the agonize beat. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("crystalline," "rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm") that reads more authorial than Kael's lived texture under pressure, especially in peak beats where compression would sharpen voice. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though a few filter verbs ("felt cold and certain," line 185) dull immediacy without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, contemplative register ("snow," "velvet quiet," "dawn") that fits the tone and remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is spare but functional, with Liam's and Anya's lines distinct in content if not idiom. The prose modulates smoothly from early tension to final warmth, and free indirect style is clean. The perceptual signature is Elara-specific (choir teacher observing voice and gesture), though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("traveled stillness," "denoting continuity") that flirts with over-writing without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register and nature-infused metaphor ("liquid starlight," "living testament"). Psychic distance remains stable; Arlo's perceptual bias (tasting memories) colors every pruning beat. The prose rhythm modulates: shorter beats at the planting, longer reflective passages at the close. One slip: "synaptic plasticity" appears three times as a mechanism label without variation, and the closing eight micro-paragraphs (from "At dawn…" onward) loop through paraphrase—"created beauty," "mended a piece of the world," "tend, harvest, nourish," "new story growing"—restating the same thematic conclusion without advancing knowledge or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Kael. Perceptual signature (nectar dusk, obsidian lens, cathedral metaphors) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue pursues goals cleanly, though Dr. Aris's lines lean expository ("Why did the drone beehive fail?"). Kael's diction ("candid nature forbidding evasion") occasionally tilts abstract. The riddle text itself—voiced as grandfather's—provides a distinct register shift that enriches rather than muddies focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("solidified silence," "the fierce tenderness of care as sacred act") which remains consistent but drifts from embodied perception into abstract register during peak beats. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's attention to "subtle shifts others never saw," but the texture flattens under pressure into thesis-like declarations. The orris root's "powdery violet scent rising faintly against the bay's damp breath" demonstrates sensory filtering, and "the streetlights' daydream deepened" sustains a coherent metaphor across the piece. However, the phrase "inadvertently profound truth settled in her bones" and "the alchemy by which a displaced seashell holds an ocean of memory" read as narrator-assisted insight rather than character-constrained thought.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("residual consciousnesses," "mnemonic catalyst," "psychic network") that clash with embodied observation. Kael's perceptual signature is generic; "mineral tears" and "granite veins" are the sole physical anchors in 750+ words of conceptual language. Syntax is uniform, relying on long compound constructions with stacked modifiers that flatten rhythm under what should be peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, filtered through Elara's technical and introspective idiom. Diction suits a mathematician's perceptual signature ("infinitesimal moment," "perpetual motion paradox"). However, peak stress moments rely on elevated abstractions ("communion across time," "sacred constant") that drift from embodied perception into philosophical voice. The final third's syntactic parallelism ("Each symbol a star. Each step a breath.") reads purposeful but borders on template cadence. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; narrative distance and diction are consistent. Perceptual signature is present but leans slightly generic ("city's relentless hum," "quiet possibility"). No head-hopping. A recurring pattern emerges: "quiet" appears six times (lines 30, 74, 90, 147, 180, 255), risking template cadence. The prose modulates with emotional beats (the daydream memory tightens, the final vigil breathes), but some interiority ("her heart swelling with the truth") tells rather than embodying the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, elevated, and historically oriented throughout, matching Elara's role as museum guide. Perceptual signature remains stable: verdant filter, water-smoothed carvings, meticulously rendered herb—all reflect her trained eye for material culture. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("The stone remembers," "The art bends but does not break"), carrying subtext of cultural memory and resilience. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction ("rosewater dread," "healing incantation," "tactile anchor to erased homelands") that, while voice-consistent, borders on ornamental in high-pressure beats where sharper embodiment would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, with purposeful diction ("neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration," "hunger stone") and a stable third-person limited POV. However, several phrases drift into elevated register that sits uneasily with a solitary clockmaker's urgency: "visible tear in the fabric of accepted order," "fleeting alchemy of optics and hope," "permanent dialogue between warning and wonder." The prose maintains clarity and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice occasionally reads more like narrated thesis than embodied perception under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans ornate throughout ("skeletal ribs," "repulsive allure," "sickly greenish light") without modulation under pressure, flattening the advisor's perceptual signature. Dialogue from the fear-thing is functional but generic threat-speak ("end of light! silence after the scream!"). The advisor's whispered lines carry subtext but the elevated register remains uniform in crisis and calm, reducing character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (cloud-reading, ritual-focused attention) remains consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("restless euphony," "soaring, complex chord") that feels imposed rather than character-particular under stress. No dialogue present to judge. Syntax varies purposefully but leans ornamental in peak beats ("erupted note was a wave of resonance meeting fury not with resistance, but invitation"), slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "fractal lacework," "syntactic verb," "harmonic properties"—the lexicon of a cartographer reading the world as text. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the whistle moment ("Her breath stilled"). The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("subsonic vibrations," "fundamental frequency") that feels slightly external to a stressed moment, and free-indirect style is mostly clean though "sunwashed dread walked with her, but transmuted" leans abstract. No dialogue present to evaluate; internal voice is consistent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a formal, measured cadence consistent with a historian's mindset ("emotionally rational to the end," "reverential care," "compassion shielding a community"). However, the diction often drifts into thematic label-speak ("noble lie," "recapture," "authentic narrative," "courageous remembering") that reads more like essay than embodied narration. Aris's interior voice lacks perceptual signature—his way of noticing the station and letter is generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to evaluate. The controlled distance and consistent register prevent major slips but the lack of rhythmic modulation under pressure and the reliance on abstract vocabulary keep the voice from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, elevated diction that fits the elegiac tone. Perceptual signature is consistent (reverent, detail-oriented). However, the prose occasionally drifts into narration that knows more than Elias could ("the pavilion embodied interlaced absence") and the lexicon—"hushed blaze," "stoically sensitive," "interlaced"—recurs as authorial motif rather than character-specific thought. Under peak pressure (drawbridge clang, final note) the voice does not compress or shift rhythm, maintaining the same measured cadence throughout and flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited with stable focalization through Elara. Diction is elevated and controlled ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness") but leans toward template phrasing—these exact phrases recur without evolution, and "dappled" appears five times across light, resolve, and the final reprise, bordering on motif-by-label. Filter verbs ("she noted," "she felt") are present but voice-motivated for an archival mindset. Psychic distance is consistent; perceptual signature reflects her indexer focus (ink chemistry, fiber weave). Under peak stress (the reveal), diction remains ornate ("wave of dappled resolve") rather than compressing to match urgency, creating mild register drift from embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in craft-filtered observations ("valley fold here, a mountain fold there") and embodied grief ("world had shrunk to the size of her grief"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during emotional peaks ("quiet, desperate alchemy," "essential attribute," "paradoxical state") that feel more authorial than character-particular. Voice modulates appropriately with pressure but lacks strong rhythmic distinctiveness. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue is present to judge. The prose serves the character but doesn't achieve a singular, irreplaceable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with Elara's perceptual signature (grief, physicist's precision, tactile focus on the geode). Diction is elevated but consistent with her intellectual background. No dialogue appears. The phrase "intangibly tangible" and "bleak exhilaration" read as authorial rather than character-specific lexicon, creating brief register drift. Psychic distance tightens during the vision, then widens for the final reflection, both shifts purposeful. Free indirect style is clean, though the closure paragraph's syntactic rhythm ("The hunt was complete. She stood…") edges toward template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    The POV remains stable third-limited on Kael with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("sharp eyes," tablet focus) but diction occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("brilliant dimness," "harmonic frequency") that reads more authorial than pilot-specific. Elara's dialogue ("You stand where starlight converges") carries a poeticized register that flattens voice distinction under the story's emotional pressure. No major filter stacks or mid-paragraph leakage; the issues are tonal rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is often elevated and poetic ("dusk bled into the horizon," "tempered regret, cool and sharp"), fitting the reflective tone but occasionally clashing with urgent internal stakes. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices carvings, watch hands, grooves) but not deeply character-particular. No dialogue appears. Register holds, though phrases like "holier weight of honesty" and "clear eyes" feel slightly generic. The voice is coherent and controlled but lacks a singular rhythmic fingerprint under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("furrowed hush," "aching liminal space," "coiled in restless eddies") that matches the solemn tone. No dialogue appears (protocol is gestural), so dialogue tests do not apply. The diction occasionally drifts into abstract, slightly over-wrought phrasing ("recycle mistakes into wisdom," "guardians of future peace") that edges beyond what a crisis-focused negotiator might frame in the moment, though it remains coherent within the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature (nautical idiom, star/navigation metaphors). Narrative certainty matches Arlo's knowledge throughout. However, several phrases feel prompt-derivative rather than character-organic: "merrily melancholic," "backlash of regrets," "flickering faith," "alignment" recur as labeled concepts rather than emerging through syntax or perception. Under peak stress (tears at Widow's Point), the voice holds, but the repeated thematic tags slightly flatten the texture. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Kael's perceptions. Diction modulates effectively from clinical precision ("neural procedure had scoured") to lyric intensity ("aching, compassionate understanding") to jaded wonder ("heart pounding with jaded wonder"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices archaic clues, shadow-arrows, and bioluminescent threads through a lens rebuilding discernment. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor register drift appears in "each fragile strand of light could be snuffed by a careless breath, yet collectively, their glow had endured centuries," which reads slightly elevated for a man post-procedure rebuilding intuition, though it aligns with the "jaded wonder" tone. The phrase "persistent tremor in his hands and a chilling void where empathy used to live" contradicts the premise (empathy remains gone, yet "used to live" implies prior presence), creating a small POV consistency gap.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable focalization on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (beast whisperer's lens, decades of listening), and diction maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout—"moss velvet-soft," "void-chill mint," "nascent constellations"—that remains voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates slightly under emotional pressure (shorter clauses as metamorphosis begins: "not pain, but an insistent unspooling"). However, the voice trends toward decorative lyricism with limited sentence-structure variety; many lines open with nominal subjects followed by appositives or participial phrases, creating a drumbeat cadence that flattens urgency in peak beats. The final paragraph stack ("Her steadiness was no longer paradoxical—it was...") edges toward expository summary rather than trusting the image to carry the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, third-person limited, maintains stable distance and focalization through Elara's perceptions. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "saline benediction," "seam of light") with purpose-driven texture. Perceptual signature reflects her cartomancer identity through metaphors of ink and signs. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "choking beauty," "willingly perplexed," "cloudbound repentance" repeat as thematic labels rather than evolving through her lived thought. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the prose modulates appropriately (thin air, icy knot, warmth radiating), but the voice's specificity weakens under peak introspection when abstraction overtakes embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Elara's perception ("quiet certainty," "ghostly resolve"). Diction balances lyricism with concrete anchors ("cool and humming with latent sorrow," "weightless near the ceiling"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during memory immersion. A few register slips toward elevated abstraction ("alchemy of shadow work," "symphony of sorrow transmuted by love") slightly dilute voice consistency under peak pressure, but the perceptual signature—compassionate, precise, attentive to shimmer and weight—remains distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV maintained with stable third-person limited. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("whispering hush," "vibrant silence woven from wave sighs") that is consistent and legible, though it risks ornamentation in high-pressure beats. Brief shift to Mano's focalization in the cove is clean but his interiority ("breath catching") momentarily blurs the POV boundary. Diction remains purposeful and character-particular for Elara; no head-hopping within paragraphs. Purposeful compression and patterned lyricism support the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and formal, with a distinct rhythm ("winking hush," "midwife," "cradle of sparks"). Kael's perceptual signature is legible: he notices geometry, tools, and tactical details. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("infinitesimal care," "starlight-mixed ink") that feels authorial rather than Kael's internal lexicon under pressure. Psychic distance is stable, but filter verbs ("felt the absence," "embodied resolve") dull immediacy in peak beats without voice-motivated payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric-textural voice ("pebbles drifted on thermal sighs," "tears welling as she pressed her bare palm flat"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the ritual, pulling back for the eels' response). However, diction inconsistency mars peak beats: "precognitive curse" and "dialogue between human pattern and cosmic law" read as external academic register rather than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. Filter verbs ("she saw fragments," "she understood") are overused where free indirect access would sharpen immediacy. The final paragraph's summary mode ("She was no longer just the eel herder; she was the pattern keeper") tells identity shift rather than trusting the image to land it, weakening voice control at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a poet under duress ("rarefying memory into luminous truth," "sacred space between silence and song"). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—without pattern-teaching or pressure modulation. Perceptual signature is generic; the prose reads more like authored commentary than Elara's lived interior. No dialogue. The voice is coherent but lacks character-particular texture, especially under peak stress where compression or fragment would signal urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is consistent, elevated, and dense with specific physical and sensory detail. Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently rises into quasi-poetic register ("liquid gold," "velvet symphony," "alchemy of waiting") that strains credulity for moment-to-moment focalization during a technical task. Elara's perceptual signature—precision, mechanical calibration, philosophical framing—is present but compressed by ornamental phrasing. No dialogue to assess. The prose texture is distinct but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over the character's urgent mental state.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent perceptual filter (raw honesty, structural metaphors). Dialogue feels natural and advances stakes. However, register drifts upward during peak beats: "confluence of selves," "testament that broken ground cultivates," "luminous fracture" read as elevated diction outside the focalizer's lived voice under stress. Kael's speech ("The break lets the light in. Your molting isn't betrayal—it's the rhythm of this place") is articulate and thematically on-point but lacks the rough edges of spontaneous speech.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a heightened, lyric register ("coaxed a fragile melody," "time flowed like the sea"). Elara's perceptual signature—pianist's attention to sound, "strategically creative" framing—is consistent, but elevated diction ("steely longing," "liminal hour," "sonic key") recurs in peak beats without variation, flattening voice under pressure. No dialogue appears; the Leo vision is silent, which suits the tone. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's "quiet resolve" and "renewed purpose" read more declarative than filtered through her immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("blistering sun on the first settler's back," "salt-tears of ocean farewells") carries specificity. However, elevated register ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt," "elegant symbiosis") drifts above Elara's practical role as reality checker, especially under peak pressure. Reflection dominates the final third, summarizing her expanded understanding and future documentation plans rather than trusting scene pressure to carry meaning. Free indirect style is clean, but syntactic patterns recur: "She felt... She heard... She tasted..."

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct contemplative rhythm and bonsai-tutor lexicon ("moss-cushioned stone," "miniature forests"). Psychic distance is controlled and the narrative voice modulates gently with emotional intensity. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts toward writerly ornament ("chromatic truth," "cartography where each loop meant 'breathe'") that edges beyond the established register, and the compass-vision sequence summarizes the memory rather than dramatizing Elara's presence with dialogue or embodied interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV is stable; voice shifts from scientific to poetic in a controlled, character-specific way; perceptual signature (noticing as a researcher then as a student of patience) is distinct and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable, deeply interior, with a distinct perceptual signature—the artist's eye for light, pattern, and fragility. Voice is lyrical and consistent. Some register elevation ("drifting resonance," "annealed") fits her artistic consciousness. The only minor flaw is a occasional over-reliance on complex nominalizations ("a palpable connection between the transient frost, the enduring stone, and her own scarred spirit") that slightly slows momentum in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is stable, clean, and deeply characterized. The voice is a distinct perceptual signature: precise, measured, observational, yet capable of poetic synthesis ("temporal seams," "mundane mysticism"). Sentence rhythm modulates beautifully with the climax, compressing and then expanding with the realization. The experimental element of looped timelines is taught early and paid off with complete coherence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    POV is stable, close third with a distinct perceptual signature—crystalline, technical, yet emotionally precise. The voice modulates with emotional intensity ("sharp as shattered quartz") while maintaining coherence. No head-hopping. The elision of Kael's death in backstory is anchored in the present logbook and pays off. Rhythmic control is evident in the cadence shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)

POV is stable, single, and deeply focalized through her perceptions ("hands that spoke in gentle chords," "the hush of dreaming roots"). Syntax and rhythm modulate beautifully with the scene's quiet intensity. The prose has a musical, meditative quality that never wavers into head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and mostly well-calibrated to an astrophysicist: phrases like “preprocesses reality” and “cosmic chaos into elegant equations” feel character-appropriate. The narrative distance is controlled, dipping into reflection while staying anchored in present sensory cues. At times the diction leans into essayistic abstraction, but the perceptual signature—seeing dust as “a fragile constellation,” reading decay as “methodology”—remains particular and coherent. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that aligns with a reflective, aesthetically obsessed protagonist. Diction and syntax have a distinct texture—rich but generally clear—and maintain a coherent psychic distance focused on Elara’s perceptions and interpretations. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the patterned elevated language feels intentional rather than generic. At times the voice stays in a uniformly high, abstract register where a bit more modulation under stress could add dynamism, but it remains publishable-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close on Elara is stable and well controlled, with a consistent, lyrical narrative texture that fits the contemplative, sensory-driven premise. The diction—“winterglass,” “liquid gold,” “silvery thread of calm”—creates a distinct perceptual signature without major register clashes. There is no head-hopping; Liam’s interiority is inferred through behavior and the glass, not asserted.

    The third-person close voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction and a distinct perceptual signature keyed to a meticulous, reverent caretaker. Sentences like “its edges catching the faint light like a captured star” show rhythmic and imagistic control without slipping into incoherence.

The voice is polished enough for immediate publication, if not formally audacious.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with phrases like “amplified quiet” and “sanctions-enforced night” creating a distinct, meditative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensuously precise, with a distinct preference for image-rich, spiritually inflected diction that suits Elara’s sensibility. The narrative perspective stays firmly with her perceptions, and psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both lush description and interior recognition. Rhythmic variations—long, flowing sentences against shorter, declarative lines—mostly serve the meditative pressure of the piece. At times, the register edges toward uniformly elevated and abstract (especially in late thematic statements), but not enough to break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s reverence for the garden and her geometric/mystical mindset. Diction feels unified—sensuous nature language blended with mathematical imagery—so the hyperbolic geometry never reads as a jarring info-dump. Rhythm modulates well, slowing for description and quickening in the disintegration sequence. A few lines verge on generalized poetic register rather than character-specific perception, but they don’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical, almost liturgical cadence that fits Elara’s long vigil and the story’s solemn stakes. Diction choices like "monastic devotion," "library of life," and "staggering grace" establish a distinct texture without obvious register slips. Psychic distance stays stable; we see through her perceptions while maintaining a slightly elevated narration that feels intentional rather than generic. There is minimal dialogue, but what little appears (the foreman’s silent bow) is handled via action rather than speech, preserving the chosen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistently colored by Elara’s synesthetic, sound-obsessed perception, giving the prose a distinct texture (e.g., aurora as “crystalline choir”). Tense and stance are stable, and the lyric compression is controlled enough that the closure remains legible under pressure. There is occasional slide into aphoristic, authorial-sounding generalization, but it doesn’t fracture POV or confuse focalization. Overall, the voice feels confident, intentional, and well-matched to a reflective, accumulative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and well-calibrated, with diction that matches a character obsessed with light and subtle signs. Rhythmic, image-heavy sentences create a distinct texture without losing basic clarity, and the psychic distance stays relatively close to Elara throughout.

At times the voice risks a slightly homogenized lyricism, but it remains controlled enough for elite-market work.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara mythologizes her own process (“the gatherer approaches the crucible—a pilgrim seeking liquid light”). Her habit of dramatically narrating tasks functions as both character trait and stylistic device, and the prose smoothly modulates from ritualistic to more grounded as her emotional state shifts. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated diction feels plausibly tied to a contemplative, poetry-infused artisan. Occasionally, the narration edges toward self-aware grandiosity that feels more authorial than strictly character-bound, which lightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable and mostly well-handled, with internal access that tracks plausibly under stress. Prose rhythm varies nicely, and Lily’s dialogue has a distinct, age-appropriate simplicity that contrasts with Elara’s more layered perception. Occasional diction choices (“firmly adaptive clarity,” “transformative betrayal”) feel slightly authorial or conceptual rather than fully grounded in her consciousness. Overall, the voice is competent and sometimes striking, but not yet singular or surprising enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct sensory and conceptual signature centered on sound, absence, and sacred duty. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a high-fantasy, quasi-mystical register and align with Elara’s oracular role; the free-indirect distance is stable and legible. Patterned phrases (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) and long, sinuous sentences feel deliberate rather than accidental, giving the piece a recognizable cadence. The density risks monotony in spots but never loses control of perspective or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that matches a reflective, newly sentient machine. The perceptual signature—sensor language, precise time-logging, and a blend of technical and lyrical observation—feels specific to Unit Seven and avoids bland committee prose. Psychic distance is steady and appropriate, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. While strong and polished, the voice doesn’t quite achieve the rhythmic distinctiveness or idiosyncrasy that would make it unforgettable at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well controlled, with a consistent perceptual filter anchored in Elara’s quiet attentiveness. Diction and rhythm are deliberate and musical without slipping into tonal inconsistency or academic register. The narrative distance stays appropriate—close enough for emotional shading, distant enough for the fable-like atmosphere. The main limitation is that the lyricism is fairly uniform; there’s little modulation in texture to mirror rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent, slightly fable-like register that fits Elara’s age and role. Sentence rhythm varies well, interweaving lush description with clean dialogue, and Kael’s sharper, dismissive speech contrasts with Elara’s composed replies. The narrative occasionally broadens into a more declarative, essayistic register in the thematic lines, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the perceptual signature—obsessive attention to plants, cracks, and tactile ritual—remains distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and well-matched to a contemplative SF vignette; diction like “unraveling of truth” and “hidden grammar” fits Kael’s blend of mechanic and mystic. The narrative maintains a coherent psychic distance, moving fluidly between concrete action and elevated reflection without head-hopping. Rhythm is generally controlled, with some consciously lyrical cadences that support the tone rather than obscuring meaning. At times the register leans slightly toward grandiose abstraction, but it remains within an intentional, character-coherent range.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a reflective, obsessive musician in a haunted opera house. Diction and syntax maintain a consistent elevated register without obvious clashes or head-hopping, and the narrative remains firmly within Elias’s sensory and conceptual frame. Rhythmic variation and image choices (e.g., “floodwater as ink and paper as canvas”) give the voice a distinct texture. At times the narration leans a bit more toward abstracted poetic statement than ground-level perception, but not enough to blur POV or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that fuses technical weather language with metaphoric sensitivity to margins, smudges, and subtle shifts. Diction and syntax feel appropriately elevated for a long-time, hyper-attentive specialist without drifting into implausible abstraction for the character. Psychic distance is well managed, allowing both sensory immediacy and reflective layering without confusion. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the modulation toward a quieter, more spacious rhythm at the end supports the reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, coherent, and textured, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends skepticism with a susceptibility to atmosphere. Diction is elevated but largely believable for this focalizer and modulates appropriately as tension tightens. Occasional expository sentences flatten the otherwise strong rhythm, but they don’t break POV or distance control. The lack of dialogue keeps focus on interior and environmental music, which the prose mostly sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elara’s perceptions, with a measured, meditative rhythm that suits the material. Diction (“regenerative silence,” “secret geometry of yielding space,” “cradle of crumbling peace”) is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic tone and doesn’t drift into incongruous register. The narrative distance remains stable; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts, and the voice modulates gently between description and interior emphasis. While somewhat uniform in tempo, the controlled cadence under pressure (during the burrowing and at the river) still feels purposeful rather than monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to Elara’s sensibility, with sensory attention to sound and touch reflecting her musician-therapist perspective. Psychic distance is mostly consistent, with occasional omniscient touches (“time softened,” “dreaming roots”) that feel more mythic than sloppy. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and age-appropriate, and the modulation of narrative rhythm around the eclipse is effective. Some abstract, high-register formulations (“softly adaptive attribute,” “ordinary magic felt not only possible but inevitable”) read more like authorial essay-voice than lived perception, slightly diluting the distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature rooted in tactile and acoustic attention (“whispers trapped in stone and timber,” “bronze quiet”). Rhythm varies well between long, sonorous sentences and shorter emphatic ones, especially near the ending. There is no POV leakage; the limited omniscience about Elara is mediated credibly through her diary. A few lines veer toward rhetorical flourish, but overall the voice is confident and distinctive without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to Silas’s reflective, slightly formal sensibility, with maritime and spycraft diction integrated smoothly. Sentence rhythms vary and support mood shifts from hushed solitude to anxious pacing to quiet emotional release.

Occasional aphoristic lines verge on authorial commentary but remain close enough to Silas’s interiority not to feel like POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with strong rhythmic control and a clear sensibility about silence and sound. POV is essentially close-third around Kael with occasional omniscient gestures, but these shifts don’t create confusion and fit the quasi-mystical register. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Kael’s questions both pursue a goal and encode theme without collapsing entirely into exposition. Some abstract phrasings drift toward essayistic, yet overall the voice feels distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., hearing memories as instruments, seeing the horizon as a metronome). Diction and syntax are elevated yet coherent with Elara’s interiority and the quasi-mystical frame; there’s no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythmic modulation works well: long, musical sentences dominate the reflective mapping, while shorter pulses mark key turns (“Then, deep silence.”). The only ceiling factor is that the voice, while strong, remains within a familiar contemporary-lyric mode rather than feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a strong lyric texture and a clear perceptual signature that blends metaphysical vocabulary with emotional pressure. Phrases like “metaphysical sliver of time between the drop and the ripple” and “periodically eternal attribute” effectively teach the piece’s conceptual register early and then sustain it. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanically patterned, and there’s no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shifts. At times the diction leans into elevated abstraction that slightly distances us from bodily immediacy, but it remains internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual world, privileging tactile and visual cues over sound. Signed dialogue is integrated cleanly through concise attributions like “he signed,” preserving both clarity and the hushed tonal quality.

The voice is distinct and confident without slipping into abstraction or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, measured, slightly elevated cadence that fits a meticulous storm recorder and remains consistent throughout. Diction like “progress laterally,” “credible curiosity,” and the attention to atmospheric minutiae give Elara a recognizable perceptual signature. The lyric register is sustained without head-hopping or confusion, and psychic distance is well-controlled, tightening around key choices. At times the abstraction level creeps up, but not enough to blur POV or intent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture shaped by Elara’s profession and sensitivities, with consistent diction and imagery throughout. Sentences modulate rhythm between lush description and more direct emotional beats, maintaining clarity. The narrative never slips in POV or tense and mostly avoids explanatory scaffolding.

Syntax and diction are controlled, with rhythmic variety and a coherent contemplative stance that doesn’t head-hop or break distance. The elevated register feels earned by the character’s vocation and the quasi-mystical setting. Occasionally, the voice tilts toward generalized aphorism at the end, but it doesn’t fracture POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is stable, lyrical, and tightly aligned with an acoustically focused consciousness, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with repeated sound-related metaphors forming a coherent register rather than drift.

Minor abstraction in some thematic lines doesn’t materially disrupt the strong voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility as a sensory and emotional technician. Static, scent, and texture dominate his perceptions, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction modulate well from cool, professional observation into more raw, immediate language as he begins to feel. Occasional abstractions (“professional ethics,” “in all dealings”) slightly flatten the otherwise character-specific register.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrical but mostly controlled, with a clear perceptual signature—Elias’s professional precision inflecting how he sees people and events. POV is stable and interior access is consistent; there’s no head-hopping. Dialogue is slightly elevated yet coherent with the story’s tone and characters’ gentleness. Occasionally the narration drifts into essayistic formulation, but not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward light, texture, and quiet emotional nuance that suits Elara. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and Kael’s rough, time-worn diction contrasts effectively with the more poetic narration. The narrative stance occasionally leans toward omniscient exposition (on Echo, the Great Forgetting) but does so in a way that still feels tonally integrated. Rhythm and diction are controlled enough for publication at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close-ish voice is consistent, lyrical, and well tuned to Elara’s observational nature; diction around natural history, time, and sound feels coherent. Sentence rhythm varies nicely, and the narrative avoids head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice does lean toward elevated, near-omniscient turns of phrase at moments (“sentient fragments of time,” “fracture in the world’s soul”), but they feel stylistically unified rather than jarringly authorial. Overall, the perceptual signature—an illustrator thinking in textures and patterns—is distinct and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how it marries magical and tactile language (“wept light,” “language of endurance,” “gentle invitation”). Rhythm and sentence variation are well handled; longer, intricate lines are balanced by precise, simple beats like the “clear, resonant *plink*.” The register suits both character and world without obvious slips or explanatory intrusion, and the lyricism holds under emotional pressure. A faint tendency toward thematic abstraction at the end is the only thing that slightly dulls the otherwise excellent voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly anchored in Elara’s perceptions and priorities, with only minor, plausible observational distance when describing Evans.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the mystical atmosphere, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm show intention—sentences lengthen into music during the ritual, then soften at the end with the hum of the cave. Occasionally, the register drifts into generalized essay-like abstraction, which slightly flattens Elara’s particular sensibility. Still, the narrative stance remains coherent, and the lyric mode is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s sensibility—precise, image-rich, and attentive to material traces. Psychic distance is well managed, moving smoothly between sensory observation and interior reflection without leaks into omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)

Rhythm and diction are largely controlled, and the mythic, elevated register feels intentional rather than accidental. There are mild instances where abstraction or grandiosity outpaces character-bound perception, but they don’t fracture POV or clarity. Overall, the voice is distinctive enough to be memorable and stable under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly Elara’s, with a strong perceptual signature (her attention to constellations, meridian lines, and technical skepticism threaded through wonder).

    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctly Elara’s—precise, slightly elevated, and tinged with professional familiarity and unease. Lexicon (“deathly vitality,” “integration,” “systemic flaws”) matches her background and thought style without obvious register slips. Rhythm varies well, balancing dense descriptive lines with shorter, declarative turns at key moments (“Tonight, she needed that fluidity desperately.”). The absence of dialogue avoids potential pitfalls and keeps the focalization tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on texture, vibration, and careful naming. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative mode and rarely slip into flattening abstraction. Diction aligns with Elara’s studious, attentive nature and doesn’t break register. The modulation under “pressure” is subtle—there are no sharp psychic-distance shifts—but the voice remains precise and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by the protagonist’s idiosyncratic way of perceiving (“every rust stain…held the ghost of a story”). Rhythm and diction are well controlled, with a confident, slightly elevated register that fits his contemplative, liminal state. Patterned metaphors around tides, fog, and fragments feel intentional rather than accidental, reinforcing the accumulative design. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance itself has a strong, distinctive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture that matches Elara’s sensibility and grief without lapsing into abstraction for most of the piece. The grandfather’s dialogue has a distinct, gentle idiom that contrasts with the more analytical narration, and the line “It does not point north, little star” is particularly effective. Rhythms vary between long, flowing sentences for atmosphere and tighter clauses around key actions (drawing the bow, the shell warming). Occasional overt thesis sentences at the end slightly dilute the otherwise distinctive, controlled voice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and colored by Kael’s sensibility, with a good balance between lyric description and clear narrative exposition. Phrases like “culture shock absorber” and “vibrant, anarchic soul” give the prose texture without slipping into incoherence. At times the narrative distance pulls back into an almost essayistic register that states motives and themes a bit too plainly, softening the immediacy of his interiority. Nonetheless, there is no POV leakage or structural confusion, and the modulation from wide descriptive lens to tighter emotional focus at the end is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, almost elegiac register suitable to a solitary vigil and a scientifically minded protagonist. Technical and poetic diction (“photochemical reaction,” “dawning hush,” “charged poise” of silence) blend smoothly, and the cadence around the shutter click and the final descent is especially well-controlled. At times the narration feels a touch more abstract and elevated than Kael himself might naturally think, shading toward authorial rather than character-particular lyricism. Nonetheless, there is no POV slippage or confusion, and the voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Elara’s sensory world, privileging touch, vibration, and sound in a way that feels both character-specific and stylistically deliberate. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, flowing sentences matching the meditative mood and shorter pulses marking key beats (e.g., “It was whole.”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narration maintains a consistent distance. The main limitation is a tendency toward uniformly elevated, almost incantatory register, which slightly reduces dynamic range under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, intelligent, and slightly wry, matching an experienced atlas editor who thinks in borders and annotations. Diction and syntax are elevated but character-plausible, with nice touches like “Noted, colleague” and “maps were conversations, not conclusions” grounding the lyricism in her personality. Rhythm varies well between long, image-rich sentences and shorter, anchoring lines, and there’s no POV leakage or clumsy exposition. The voice feels distinct enough to be memorable and carries the story’s conceptual load gracefully.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled, with patterned diction (“wild hush,” “threads of silver light”) that feels intentional and cohesive. POV distance stays stable: close enough to follow Elara’s perceptions while retaining a slightly mythic narrative stance. Rhythm and syntax are varied and mostly well-tuned to the accumulative design, with cadences that echo footsteps. At times the language flirts with over-ornamentation, but it remains legible and on-voice rather than slipping into generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically textured, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technical awareness (oxygen gauges, submersible) and devotional awe. Diction is consistently elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical premise, and psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress. There is no dialogue to test, but interiority and description carry the narrative without clumsy exposition. At times the register feels marginally more ornate than a drowning diver’s likely in-the-moment cognition, though the piece clearly privileges a lyric mode over strict realism.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“copperlight repose,” “truth finally witnessed,” “see through the scars of silence”—that feels unified and intentional. POV is stable around Kael, with only mild omniscient glosses that don’t seriously disrupt focalization, and psychic distance modulates well around key beats (Elias kneeling, the quiet after he looks). Dialogue is spare but functional; Elias’s skepticism and later contrition register without over-explanation, though his voice is not sharply differentiated from the narrative idiom. The lyric register is elevated but generally coherent with the contemplative, almost mythic frame of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled diction and a clear perceptual bias toward the spectral and botanical. The brief shift to Elias at the end is clean and doesn’t disrupt focalization. Rhythms are generally well managed, though certain constructions and key phrases repeat enough to feel slightly patterned. It’s a strong, unified voice, if a touch uniform in cadence and register.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical third-person voice is coherent, confident, and distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature that blends maritime and sacred imagery (“poetic wharf weaver,” whalebone needle, moon-silk and sea-grass thread). Diction and rhythm are well-controlled and modulate appropriately, slowing around reverent beats and tightening subtly at convergences and the basin. POV distance remains steady and intimate without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Minor repetition of key phrases and adjectives occasionally brushes purple, but not enough to damage clarity or voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and lyrically charged, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara notices light, soil, and bone. Diction and rhythm are controlled, leaning into long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative, “cautious enchantment” tone without losing clarity. There’s a strong match between narrative stance and subject; the prose rarely slips into an external, explanatory register. A slight limitation is a tendency toward similar cadences and abstractions near the end, which modestly narrows its distinctiveness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, slightly elevated lyric register that matches Elara’s sensibility and the story’s aesthetic. Diction and rhythm remain coherent throughout, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain interiority relative to what the POV could perceive. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the patterned phrasing around technology/nostalgia feels intentional rather than mechanical. Some repetitions of abstract formulations (“carefully inventive,” “meaning in the margins,” “futuristic nostalgia”) slightly flatten the voice’s freshness but don’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the quasi-mystical observatory setting, with recurring images of thread, starlight, and silence giving it a distinct texture. Diction is elevated but generally plausible for the narrative stance, and the prose modulates gently with shifts in tension (more incantatory around the candle, more concrete at dawn). There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and narrative certainty largely matches what Elara could infer. A few stock formulations (“fate of the kingdom hung in the balance”) slightly dilute the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close POV on Kael is stable and persuasive, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice. Elara’s dialogue has a distinct, ritualistic cadence that differentiates her without breaking plausibility in this fantastical context.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (war-zone-forged but still tender). Diction and metaphors (“watercolor haze of indigo and pearl,” “pacific translator of sorrows”) are cohesive and feel rooted in Anahera’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between external detail and interior reflection without head-hopping. Occasionally the register edges toward abstract/ornate phrasing, but it remains legible and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Elara’s perceptions and values. Diction (“painted with light,” “living tapestry of elders’ whispers”) reflects her artistic, memory-focused mind and rarely drifts into incongruous register. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose musical without lapsing into monotony or confusion. The voice remains controlled even at emotional peaks, though occasional abstract formulations (“core concept unfolded”) are slightly more expository than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and consistent, with perception tightly channeled through Elara’s sensibility as a restorer attuned to texture and sound. The voice has a distinct lyric cadence—phrases like “a sacred, breathless suspension where time itself seemed to hold its breath” and “acoustic prism” show rhythmic and lexical control without losing clarity. Psychic distance modulates well, moving from external detail to interior realization at major beats (especially during the awakenings). At times the register flirts with over-elevated abstraction, but it remains coherent for this aesthetic and character.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a “rogue scholar,” with a consistent lexicon and rhythm throughout. Dialogue is sparse but purposefully cryptic, carrying subtext and world rules without info-dumps. The narrative stance doesn’t wobble, and the diction retains a distinct texture that feels authorial rather than generic. At times the elevated register leans toward uniform grandeur across beats, leaving limited modulation to sharpen pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyric, with a distinctive lexicon (“reef-shadow joy,” “blossom armistice,” “shyly unstoppable”) that matches the timeless, fable-like frame. Rhythm and syntax are controlled; the prose modulates gently at the climax so the illumination feels like a genuine cadence shift rather than just another ornate paragraph. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” tone undermining the intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and well-controlled, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits the fabulist premise. Diction like “museum of extinct feelings” and “foxglove regret” feels intentional and patterned rather than haphazard, and the psychic distance remains consistent. There is no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion beyond the chosen register. At times the lyricism risks self-consciousness, but it never fully breaks the spell or confuses perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice on Elara is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction and a distinct perceptual focus on language and pattern. Shifts into Kael’s perspective are brief and clean, primarily through dialogue and observable reaction rather than intrusive interiority. Dialogue is slightly elevated but suits the quasi-sacred, scholarly context and carries clear emotional subtext. A touch more variation in rhythm—especially around peak beats—would push the voice into a truly standout register.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Kael’s technical yet reverent sensibility, with consistent diction and controlled psychic distance. POV is stable and modest; we never know more than fits this close, observant stance. Dialogue, though brief, feels natural and stakes-aware, cleanly marking status shifts in Elara and Borin’s reactions. At times the register pushes toward elevated, but it stays coherent with the quasi-mythic tone the piece is aiming for.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and distinctly Elias’s, with perception consistently funneled through his sensibility (dust as “tiny historians,” paper trails as sanctuary). Rhythm and diction are largely stable and purposeful, supporting the accumulative, meditative mode while modulating at key beats (“a breath that felt like his first in twenty years”). There is occasional drift toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity. Overall, the narrative stance is confident and unified, with no head-hopping or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, contemplative texture that matches Elara’s meditative mindset. Diction like “featherly determined resolve” and “fractured hush” recurs as motif rather than random ornament, and the narrative distance remains consistent. There is occasional register inflation and explanatory phrasing, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility for a reflective protagonist in a slightly surreal world. Overall the voice feels deliberate, controlled, and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture that feels plausibly aligned with an introspective, quasi-mystical scientist. Recurring coinages like “shadowseam wonder” and “luminous respite” create a recognizable perceptual signature without drifting into pseudo-academic register. Psychic distance is well controlled, tightening around key beats (the first breath of air, the fireflies’ appearance, the release of the feather). Very occasional phrasing edges toward self-consciousness, but overall the voice is confident, coherent, and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility; diction like “cheerful gloom” and “sea-foam recollectionist” feels unified rather than ornamental. Rhythm varies well, with a good mix of sinuous descriptive sentences and shorter, weight-bearing beats at key moments. The narrative never slips in POV or register, and the lyricism holds under pressure without becoming opaque. A bit of end-paragraph abstraction slightly blurs the otherwise sharp, character-bound texture.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear sensibility that notices tides, constellations, and pedestrian patterns in analytical yet poetic terms. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; the prose rarely stumbles, and the psychic distance is generally appropriate for this reflective, quiet scenario. At times the narration feels more like an elevated authorial voice than something distinctly filtered through Corbin’s idiolect, especially in its more abstract thematic lines. That slight gap between character-filtered perception and a “literary” narrator keeps the voice from feeling absolutely singular.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyric voice is consistent, confident, and texturally distinctive (“obsidian grace,” “thermals of purpose”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching the ritual’s solemnity without losing clarity. POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond a light, appropriate authorial tilt. The main limitation is a relatively uniform high-register lyricism that rarely modulates for contrast, which slightly flattens emotional dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and well-matched to a reflective artisan, with a strong perceptual signature around light, glass, and pattern. Diction like “noctilucent reckonings” and “pearlescent fog” is elevated but coherent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythms and a distinct perceptual signature centered on scars, fire, and fragile objects. Phrasing like “hard softness,” “syntax of scars,” and “keeper of embers” creates a recognizable texture. There is mild register drift toward abstract/academic diction (“universal language,” “translate…pain,” “motivation crystallized”), which slightly strains plausibility for this character under stress. Nonetheless, POV remains stable, interior access is clean, and the modulation from contemplative to quietly resolved is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is controlled, with a distinct texture of mathematical and oceanic imagery (“cartography of light,” “altitude…for soul”).

The voice occasionally leans toward abstraction, but it remains legible and aligned with the story’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctive, with a clear perceptual bias toward sound and resonance befitting an “echo cartographer.” Diction is controlled and mostly well-matched to this slightly elevated, poetic register.

Overall, the voice feels intentional and memorable, if a touch uniform in emotional color.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct texture in its diction and cadences (“liquid rainbows,” “a thread of silver in the gathering gloom”). The focalization is steady around the painter; we’re not yanked into other minds, even when glimpsing scenes inside mirrors or in the distant cottage. At times the register leans toward the generic-elevated (“A profound peace settled over the painter’s features”) rather than character-particular, but it does not break the spell. Overall, the voice suits the fable-like, numinous mode.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with Kaelen’s perceptual bias (ritual, history, guilt) shaping diction and focus. Sentence rhythm is varied and often musical without becoming opaque, and the psychic distance stays stable. Dialogue is lean, sounds human, and advances conflict and status (the elder’s spit and the scoff vs. his calm explanations). Occasional aphoristic turns slightly threaten to genericize the voice but do not fundamentally break its integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits a powerful, hyper-rational man haunted by beauty. Perception is tightly filtered through Silas’s priorities: ledgers, water rights, bird song, the tactility of salt and velvet. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and short emphatic ones, especially around the ritual and the tear. The omniscient-leaning commentary feels integrated with his consciousness rather than a separate, intrusive narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture (“bodily poetic,” “serpents of captured starlight,” “between a sigh and a smile”) that feels intentional rather than generic. Diction and rhythm hold steady under pressure, and the psychic distance is well controlled; we stay anchored in Elara’s sensibility throughout. There’s a mild risk of the elevated register feeling more authorial than strictly character-bound, but the stylized world supports it. With no dialogue to test, the narrative voice nonetheless carries the entire piece with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent with Elias’s sensibility—phrases like “meteor hush” and “half-lit epiphanies” feel like his mind at work rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance is managed well, blending his thoughts with descriptive narration without leakage or confusion. The cadence generally matches the reflective mode, with sentence rhythm modulating appropriately as his resolve crystallizes. A slight tendency toward elevated, essay-like abstraction in late thematic sentences keeps it from feeling entirely effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinct: lush, sensuous, and attentive, very much in keeping with an “esoteric realist” focalizer. Rhythm and diction (e.g., “minutes stretched like spun sugar,” “whisper of weight”) are controlled and modulate well around the central interruption when the monarch arrives. There is no POV leakage or unexplained knowledge; the narration stays within a plausible, slightly heightened psychic distance. Some readers at elite venues might find the consistently elevated register a touch ornate, but it is coherent and purposeful rather than generic or wobbly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with a craft-obsessed, reverent protagonist; diction like “crucible,” “matrix,” and “technically gentle hands” suits both the world and her profession. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the accumulative lyric mode is taught early and maintained. There are a few slightly self-conscious or repeated phrasings (“technically gentle hands,” “snowmelt ardor”) that feel more prompt-driven than organic, which mildly undercuts the illusion of a singular, lived-in voice. Nonetheless, distance control and focalization are consistently strong.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and sensibly matched to Elara’s heightened perception and the story’s mythic register. Diction and rhythm support the lyrical, slightly incantatory mood without losing basic clarity or devolving into abstraction. There are a few moments of generic spiritual phrasing, but overall the narrative stance feels controlled and consistent. The pattern of description and interiority is well-taught early and sustained through the transcendence sequence and return.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct, elevated diction that suits a devout, mathematically-minded Babylonian astronomer and sustains a contemplative mood. Patterns like “dusky harmony,” “encrypted devotion,” and careful clause rhythms give the prose a recognizable texture without major POV slippage. At times the abstract register verges on homiletic or essayistic, especially when summarizing realizations, but the underlying stance and distance remain stable. Overall, the voice feels controlled and intentional, if a shade over-insistent in its key terms.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a clear perceptual signature (metaphor-rich, metaphysical, yet grounded in bodily sensation). Psychic distance is managed well, sliding closer for Kael’s embodied recall and broader for descriptions of the shifting universe. The rare spoken line and thought-communication fit the established mode and do not jar tonally. At times the register edges toward abstract/philosophical diction, but it remains coherent with the piece’s chosen voice rather than feeling like drift.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, assured, and well-suited to a quiet, ritualistic fantasy; diction is consistent with a reflective craftsperson in a numinous setting. The prose modulates nicely, growing more luminous as the ritual deepens without losing clarity.

Still, control over distance and rhythm is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice through Elara is consistent, with a distinctive lyrical texture and controlled shifts in intensity. Diction fits the quasi-mythic, slightly archaic tone of the world and Elara’s craft without obvious register breaks. Dialogue is sparse but natural and emotionally direct, and the two voices are just distinct enough at this length. At times the narration leans into abstract phrasing (“core concept of deciduous vows unfolded”) that feels more authorial than character-bound, slightly thinning the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet”) that feels consistent with an experienced curator in a rarefied setting. POV is stable and modest; the narration never claims knowledge beyond what Elara can plausibly infer. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer, lush sentences for atmosphere and tighter ones at moments of insight or action. The only minor limitation is that the elevated diction is fairly uniform across emotional states, leaving less modulation between bewilderment, breakthrough, and communion than the piece might bear.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct—lyric, slightly archaic, and tightly aligned with an arcane linguist who perceives grammar in stone and syntax in shadows. POV is stable third close around Elara; we never slip into unjustified omniscience. Dialogue is spare but functional, with Kael’s rasping urgency and the Warden’s leaf-rustle formality contrasting cleanly with Elara’s steady, considered responses. Rhythm modulates well between dense descriptive passages and more clipped, high-pressure exchanges at the Warden confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how Lyra notices decay, fog, and objects as narrative threads.

    The close third-person voice is steady, precise, and well-matched to an archivist: attentive to mechanisms, textures, and conceptual framing without drifting into sterile academicese. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating length to suit description versus ritual action, and there is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Lyric touches (“liquid memory,” “a cathedral of measured time”) feel consistent with the established narrative texture. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable but not yet so idiosyncratic that it feels utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, elevated, and distinctively tuned to sound and resonance, giving the prose a memorable texture. Diction like “bloom of hush,” “hammered repose,” and “ripple-mark mapkeeper” builds a coherent idiom that suits the world.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with distinctive phrasing (“thistle-blown hope,” “a vibration woven into the very silica”). Rhythm modulates appropriately, shortening and sharpening around the moment of alignment and the suspended “three heartbeats.” The brief dialogue from Master Aris is somewhat didactic in content but tonally consistent with the mythic, ceremonial voice of the piece. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the perceptual signature remains steady under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—Elara notices textures, light, and sound in ways that reveal both profession and temperament. Rhythm varies well between lush descriptive runs and shorter, firmer sentences at moments of realization (“She would not merely witness this transition—she would shape it.”). There is no POV slippage, and the elevated diction feels earned by the quasi-mythic, ritualized context. Occasionally the narrative slips into more general essay-like formulations, but these remain within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyrical close POV is controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s tactile, sensory attention and technical language around fireworks.

Diction and rhythm are consistent and confident, and brief dialogue lines feel natural and suitably spare, carrying subtext (“The old shell was too tight”).

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and clearly Elara-filtered, with a strong preference for tactile, synesthetic metaphors (“liquid amber poured over her skin,” “taste of honeyed light”). Rhythmically, the prose modulates well—longer, incantatory sentences in contemplative moments, slightly tighter phrasing around the inversion beat—without losing clarity. Diction stays within a unified elevated register that suits the mythic, speculative frame, and there is no head-hopping or stance slippage. A few abstract phrases verge on essayistic, but they do not materially disrupt the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person narration has a distinct, elevated lyric register with recurring motifs (“vaulting hush,” “in transit”) and a cool, precise sensibility that fits Elara’s practiced role. POV is stable and controlled, with access to Leo’s reactions framed through Elara’s observing stance and a mildly omniscient-leaning narrator. Occasionally, diction like “calibrated,” “fluidly logical precision,” and “gentle catalyst designed to shift perception” slips toward conceptual/technical language that feels slightly at odds with the tender, grief-centric moment. Overall, though, rhythm and syntax are well-managed, and the voice feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)

Psychic distance is steady, and shifts toward heightened interiority at the climactic link are smooth. A few sentences tilt into essayistic abstraction or therapy-adjacent diction that slightly dilutes the otherwise embodied, image-driven voice. Overall, though, the narrative stance is confident and recognizably particular to this character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but largely controlled register that fits speculative literary fiction and Elara’s reflective state. Phrasing such as “shadowseam wonder incarnate” and “quiet architect of light” establishes a recognizable texture without breaking POV plausibility. Psychic distance stays stable; we don’t slip into omniscience or head-hop, and the narrative certainty matches what Elara can infer. Occasionally the diction slides toward high-concept abstraction, but not enough to blur who is perceiving or why.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (attention to resonance, vibration, dust patterns) that matches Elara’s cultivated “bridge of intuition.” Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the narrative distance stays stable; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly have in the moment. The diction is elevated but consistent, and the absence of dialogue keeps the voice unitary and focused. A few lines verge on authorial aphorism rather than character-grounded thought, but not enough to break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a strong lyric texture that matches the surreal setting. Diction and syntax show control—phrases like “paths of crushed pearl and phosphorescent moss” and “flowers blooming in forgotten star-languages” feel deliberate rather than random. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re close enough to Kael to feel his shifts without head-hopping or explanatory intrusions. The main constraint is that the elevated register is so uniform it occasionally flattens nuance of mood, where a slight modulation might have sharpened key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and distinctly lyrical, with a controlled cadence that suits the contemplative mode. Diction like “tactfully hopeful gesture” and “examined unknown” fits Elara’s reflective, archivist mindset and remains plausible for her education and disposition. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and the narrative distance stays stable even as it zooms slightly out for thematic statements. While some abstractions blur sharpness, the overall voice has a clear perceptual signature and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and suitably lyrical, with a strong preference for image-driven abstraction (“coded freedom,” “quiet fire of coded freedom”). POV boundaries are clean; we never leave Elara’s perceptual frame, and the narrative distance stays stable. Rhythm is generally well modulated, though the diction sometimes slips into a uniform high-register cadence that flattens the sense of rising stress. There is a distinct tonal signature, but it could benefit from sharper modulation and a few more grounded, character-specific turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly anchored in Elias’s perceptions and lexicon. Rhythm varies well between longer, atmospheric sentences and shorter, charged ones at key ritual moments (“Then, he stopped. Then, absolute silence.”). The narrative confidently handles slightly elevated diction without feeling detached from the character. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice’s musicality strengthens rather than muddies the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility, with recurring phrases like “mossy delight” giving it a distinct texture. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional, and there is no POV slippage. The modulation between quiet ritual action and heightened luminous moments reads smooth. It’s strong, if a bit uniformly elevated in register for a piece that never truly strains the voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s sensibility as a tinkerer sensitized to time and mechanism. Diction is consistent and controlled, with patterned phrases like “soft ticking of rescued clocks” and “silent language written in loss and leaf” giving it a distinct texture. There’s no POV leakage or artificial exposition; reflective moments are cleanly anchored to present stimuli. At times the voice edges toward overt abstraction in the thematic sentences, but it never breaks coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with an intellectually rigorous yet emotionally attuned alchemist. Repetition of motifs (“luminous,” “factually mystical”) helps build a recognizable texture, and the syntax generally supports a contemplative, ritualistic cadence. At times, diction drifts toward ornate or meta (“factually mystical”) in ways that feel slightly self-conscious rather than purely character-driven. While distinctive and controlled overall, the voice could benefit from a few sharper, less generalized turns of phrase under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly anchored in Elara’s sensibility, with a controlled, quasi-mythic register that fits the material. Diction and rhythm are deliberate, and the prose modulates gently as pressure builds, without head-hopping or stance confusion. Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing both plot and emotional shift (e.g., the badger tapestry exchange). Overall, the POV is confident and coherent, even if occasionally leaning toward a uniform elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—clinical yet haunted—with recurring mathematical and sensory registers that feel rooted in Kael. Lexical choices like “Mercy_Coefficient_01” and “topological pathways” create a credible cognitive signature and are balanced by more visceral lines. There is some drift into generalized philosophical abstraction that briefly flattens the immediacy, but stance and perspective remain stable. Overall, the POV control is confident and consistent with the character’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent lyrical texture and clear perceptual signature, with metaphors and diction aligned to Elara’s role and world (“between-worlds translator,” “river songs,” “anchors of intuition”). Psychic distance is well controlled, gliding between external detail and interior memory without confusion. There are occasional authorial-feeling abstractions, but they do not break POV or clarity. Overall, the voice feels confident and unified, if slightly polished toward the literary-lyric default.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice is stable, with a distinct observational texture that fits a meticulous technician who sees ghosts and reads dust. Diction like “a language of absence and intention” and “weightless burden” is elevated but mostly coherent with the reflective, quiet-supernatural mode. Occasional phrasing (“His attribute of being skillfully observant”) feels more like prompt scaffolding than organic thought, which momentarily flattens voice. Overall, though, the narrative stance is controlled and consistent, modulating well from eerie to tender.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is consistent and confident, with a distinctive lyrical texture that suits the surreal setting. Diction (“bottled whisper,” “starlight ink,” “cloud-parchment”) feels of a piece with the world and rarely drifts into incongruent registers. There is a controlled rhythm to the sentences, and focalization does not slip into unjustified omniscience. The main limitation is some reliance on familiar abstract formulations for inner states, which slightly flattens the otherwise strong narrative personality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice through Elara is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by her reverence for both Kaelen and the Aethel; syntactic rhythm supports the lush, baroque mood without losing clarity. Lexicon and register—“chroniton,” “calligraphy of intention,” “burnished sorrow”—feel coherent with a highly educated, quasi-academic yet devotional focalizer. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Valerius’s brief lines carrying subtext and status shift. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and psychic distance is managed smoothly, tightening appropriately in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a sensibility that reveres craft and covenant; diction like “tinkersong wonder” feels organic to that stance. There is good rhythmic variation and a confident handling of elevated language without obvious head-hopping or register breaks. The narrative distance stays in a close-omniscient/close-third band that suits a mythic tone. At times the voice flirts with uniform grandiosity, which slightly flattens modulation between quiet and peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward scent and subtle sensory shifts. Syntax varies well, and the cadence supports the hush and gradual deepening without becoming monotonous or opaque. Registers of diction (“subterranean lagoon,” “resonant hush,” “charged poise” implied) fit both character and the quasi-mystical situation. Occasional abstract formulations at the end edge toward authorial essaying, but they don’t disrupt POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive and consistent, with a lyrical, sea-and-craft inflected lexicon that clearly belongs to Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well between long, humming sentences and sharper beats around actions like drawing the knife or tucking away objects. A few abstractions and thematic declarations push toward essayistic, but they don’t fracture POV control or legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that favors light, texture, and quiet sensory thresholds and never breaks POV boundaries. Diction (“umbral tenderness,” “dawning hush,” “star-dusted sky”) is elevated but coherent with Elara’s artistic sensibility, and psychic distance is well controlled. There’s a confident modulation from descriptive to more compressed, interior language at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and well-controlled, with a lyrical yet disciplined diction that suits a contemplative archivist under extreme strain. Sensory and conceptual focus track Elias’s mind—technical when dealing with ciphers and archives, more fevered and image-driven in the lagoon sequence. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and tense/stance remain consistent through the transition into and out of the reverie. The prose texture is distinctive without becoming mannered, supporting the “searing” intensity without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and closely aligned with Elara’s perceptions, marked by specific, sensory-driven diction (“disciplined architecture of her working memory,” “ink mixed with abalone shell”). Rhythm modulates well between longer, image-rich sentences in reflective stretches and tighter, declarative lines at turns (“She opened her eyes. The bottle seemed to glow…”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the poetic register feels plausible for a contemplative alchemist in a quasi-mythic setting. The voice is distinctive and confident without tipping into self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in sound, tactility, and archival thinking. Lyric diction like “velvet disquiet” and “a canvas for nascent emotions to bloom” matches the character’s role and the story’s mode without slipping into generic ornament. Temporal handling of the field trip memory is controlled and clearly anchored by present cues. There is no head-hopping or register break, and rhythm modulates effectively from dense, meditative early sentences to a more distilled cadence near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled high register that suits the quasi-mystical ritual and never lapses into explanation-heavy scaffolding. Diction and rhythm show deliberate patterning (“wild serenity,” “furiously tranquil”) that feels intentional rather than mechanically repetitive, and perceptual focus stays tightly bound to Elara. There are no POV slips or unwarranted omniscience; the narrative confidently inhabits her sensory and conceptual frame. The main limiter for top-tier scores is that the lyric voice, while strong, leans toward a familiar “elevated fantasy” texture rather than something utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and convincingly aligned with a contemplative, empirically minded observer. Diction choices like “laminar flows,” “solstice hush,” and “frost-feather angles” establish a distinctive perceptual signature without drifting into incoherence. Dialogue is brief but natural and status-aware, with the Abbot’s single line carrying recognition and thematic weight. POV control is clean, with no leakage or gratuitous explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative mode; diction like “flourishing stillness” and “primal elegance” coheres with the cosmic-spiritual frame. Rhythm is generally controlled, with long, flowing sentences matching the meditative pace. However, the narrative idiom sometimes reads more like an essayistic essay/narrator than like Elian’s distinct mental texture, blurring character-specific voice. There are no POV slips or mechanical dialogue issues (none present), and psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, lyrical omniscience that fits the contemplative premise. The diction (“tranquilly perceptive,” “mute eloquence”) creates a clear tonal signature, and POV distance is stable. There is some tendency toward elevated abstraction, but it reads as intentional rather than careless. Absence of dialogue suits the story’s commitment to silence as action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture built from sensory metaphors and time-language that fits Kael’s sensibility. The brief POV shift to Elara near the end is cleanly marked and maintains the same tonal register while legitimately narrowing to her immediate understanding. Diction and rhythm generally feel controlled and purposeful rather than generic or mechanical. The elevated, almost ceremonial register is sustained without obvious register breaks, supporting the story’s speculative-literary ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with consistent lyric diction and a clear perceptual signature oriented to light, water, and subtle motion. Syntax and rhythm are controlled and generally well-modulated, with occasional over-elevation but no serious register breaks. The narrative stance remains confidently inside this contemplative, slightly mythic sensibility throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, almost liturgical rhythm that fits Kael’s temperament and the piece’s contemplative mode. Diction is precise and slightly elevated without sliding into academic or corporate register, and POV modesty holds—no information appears that isn’t plausibly within his awareness or inference. Repeated constructions (“He had…,” “The copper…”) verge on incantatory rather than mechanical, mostly serving tone. The voice isn’t radically distinctive, but it is steady, legible, and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture—scientific lexicon folded into sensuous description (“post-contact atmospheric spikes matched volatile compounds…”), matching Aris’s identity. POV is steady without leakage, and the brief dialogue segments are natural and character-appropriate, with Elias’s rigidity softening credibly. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and tighter, charged lines at key turns. Occasionally, the narration leans into slightly abstract lyric tags (“bronze quiet,” “quiet revolution”) that feel more authorial than strictly character-bound, but they don’t disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, slightly elevated lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct texture in diction and rhythm (“narrow ribbon of weathered wood,” “submerged concord hidden by shame”). The perspective stays tightly aligned with Kael’s experiential frame, even though the register is more mythic than strictly character-bound. Psychic distance and sentence rhythm modulate well to carry both atmosphere and emotional beats (notably around the cormorant and the nightingale). Occasional omniscient-feeling abstractions don’t materially disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with Kael’s “intuitively descriptive” perception shaping syntax and image choice throughout. Diction is elevated but coherent with a reflective, post-apocalyptic mood and doesn’t break psychic distance or POV plausibility. Rhythmic control is generally strong, with longer, lusher sentences in reflective passages and a slightly crisper cadence as he takes action at the end. There are no POV slips or head-hops, and the sparse dialogue fits the tone and status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyric-scientific texture that fits an observant, technically literate protagonist. Diction (“temporally stretched dreamscape,” “luminous rivers”) is elevated but coherent with her role and environment, and the register does not drift into incongruous jargon. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both external observation and internal inference without head-hopping. Under pressure (the Lyre glimpse), the voice maintains rhythm and clarity without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical yet controlled diction that matches Kael’s reverent, apprentice-of-wonder sensibility. Phrases like “pedestal of solidified moonlight” and “pocket sundial lid…etched with constellations that felt like a promise” establish a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative stance remains stable with no head-hopping or register breaks, and the rhythm modulates from descriptive awe to slightly quicker beats during the swapping sequence. Some labeled attributes (“sacredly playful reverence,” “cautious abandon”) feel a touch conceptual rather than fully embodied in the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in its diction and metaphoric choices. Third-person focus on Elara is stable; the brief expansions into others’ past acts feel like the gallery’s memory rather than POV leakage. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, supporting the ceremonial mood without slipping into confusion. The elevated register suits the piece’s intent, though it slightly distances us from more granular, character-specific thought.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends physical minutiae (“barbules,” “quill,” “asymmetrical vanes”) and emotional weight. Syntax and rhythm vary well, modulating toward more compressed phrasing under peak pressure. Diction is elevated but broadly in keeping with a seer embedded in a fantastical, book-saturated environment. A few phrases edge toward generic lyricism, but overall the voice is distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture: elevated but not academic, with a clear perceptual bias toward chess metaphors and textile imagery that fits Kael’s mind. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with longer, lyrical sentences in descriptive moments and crisper phrasing around key actions (the decoding, the chime). There is no POV leakage or confusion; the narration’s certainty stays within what Kael can infer. The main ceiling comes from occasional diction that feels more authorially ornate than strictly character-bound, even if it remains aesthetically pleasing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a confident, lyrical texture (“petrified prayers,” “forged hush”) that feels coherent and suited to the mythic tone, and Elara’s spoken lines are distinct from Borin’s more formal register. POV distance is stable and controlled; we stay close enough to Elara’s intentions without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Rhythm varies effectively between sweeping description and tighter, high-stakes dialogue beats. Occasionally the diction nears over-elevated or repetitive (“refract” as a repeated thesis-term), but not to the point of undermining control.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with the heightened, alchemical-fantastical milieu. Diction choices ("scent of ozone and regret," "silent, weightless eternity") create a distinct perceptual signature that feels like Kael’s mind under duress rather than generic narration. The occasional quoted narration of the ritual folds smoothly into the narrative texture and underscores his need for control. Some metaphors are dense, but they maintain tonal coherence and do not fracture POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct painter’s sensibility coloring perception and metaphor. Sentence rhythm is controlled, modulating between long, sinuous lines for reflection and shorter ones for turns or realizations. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty stays plausibly bound to Elias’s knowledge and sensibility. A slight drift toward abstract, essayistic phrasing in thematic sentences keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice on Elias is stable, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent sensual focus on scent, light, and vibration. Silas’s brief dialogue sounds distinct—roughened, awed, less figurative—without breaking the established narrative stance. Rhythm and diction mostly support the emotional beats, modulating between long, flowing sentences and shorter emphatic ones. Occasional elevated abstractions (“resonate with a clarity force can never achieve”) flirt with a more essayistic register but don’t seriously disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture (“voice like wind through wires,” “geography of loss”) and remains consistent in diction and distance. Rhythms modulate well between slower, reflective lines and more immediate beats (soldering, joining the final wire, phone ringing), maintaining clarity despite the figurative density. Dialogue is minimal but effective and in-voice, especially the phone’s cryptic instructions. A few phrases drift toward generic lyricism, but overall the perceptual signature feels controlled and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Elara links environment and method (“rational truffle forager,” “living metaphor for their world”). The academic/clinical terms (psychological safety, empathy virus) sit mostly comfortably beside the sensory prose and feel like part of her rational mindset. There’s strong rhythmic control without obvious POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Silas’s occupational gaze and contemplative temperament. Syntax and diction support a lyric, slightly elevated register that suits the introspective, atmospheric mode. While some phrasing (“softly persistent,” “witnessed isolation,” “gaps”) repeats enough to feel a touch programmatic, it doesn’t break the voice or cause confusion. Distance control is steady, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and textured, with a consistent blend of precise physical observation and gently heightened diction that suits a solitary map dealer. Patterns like “empirically intuitive” and image clusters around light, maps, and guidance create a perceptual signature that feels particular rather than generic. There is some risk of the narrator’s language occasionally sounding more essayistic than fully interior, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity. Modulation under pressure (shorter, more focused beats during the rising creek) is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct rhythmic and imagistic texture that suits a mythic-fantasy frame and Lyra’s introspective journey. The third-person limited stance stays stable, and the one line of dialogue emerges naturally from the established diction and authority of her “softly commanding” voice. Cadence modulates well between sweeping description and tighter interior focus, without head-hopping or confusing shifts. The main constraint is that the elevated register brushes against purple at times, slightly narrowing emotional range in favor of beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctive—lush, slightly elevated, and aligned with a “scientifically romantic” consciousness. Diction choices like “density of presence,” “directed spontaneity,” and “ember nexus” feel of a piece and rarely jar. Dialogue for Kael and Lyra is spare, natural, and carries subtext; their brief exchange efficiently reveals history and emotional stakes. Psychic distance remains stable around Elara, with the occasional omniscient-leaning flourish still feeling tonally coherent rather than like head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive: lyrical but coherent, with metaphors and elevated diction that match a reflective “lucid dream chronicler.” POV remains stable and limited to Elias’s consciousness; even the dream logic is filtered through his sensibility. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, with some nicely modulated cadences at emotional peaks. Occasionally the register trends toward abstract or ornate, which may slightly distance us from the raw immediacy of the crisis, but not enough to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s introspective, sensory-aware perspective, especially given her history as an aromatherapist. Diction like “liquid time,” “occluded views,” and “trembling calm” feels of a piece with the world and character rather than generic purple prose. The small amount of dialogue is natural and carries subtext (Mrs. Gable’s frayed poise, the gratitude at the end) without over-explaining. Psychic distance remains steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends scholarly precision (runes, vellum, crystallizing ink) and lyric sensitivity to weather and texture. Rhythm is well-modulated, slowing for interior beats and tightening around the crystallization crisis and the tear. Diction remains plausible for a rune scholar in a quasi-mystic setting, avoiding jarring register shifts. There is minimal exposition; the world’s rules are learned through her focused noticing and the prose never feels like a generic narrator speaking over her.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent third-person close vantage that stays anchored in Elara’s perceptions while allowing brief, plausible access to Valerius once manifested. Metaphoric density and elevated diction feel like part of this world rather than unmotivated ornament, and key spoken lines (“You advise through metaphors, Madame Exorcist”) carry subtext about her methods. The rhythm modulates reasonably with pressure—though it remains on the lush side even at peak tension—and there are no POV slips or register jolts. A touch more textural roughness during the climactic beats could better align with the “grit” the ending invokes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, elevated, and well-matched to the metaphysical subject matter, with a clear third-person close focus on Elara. Patterned phrases (“resounding hush,” “journeying inward while walking out”) are used as structural motifs rather than empty repetition, teaching a rhythm the story then pays off. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and shifts in intensity around key words (“memory,” “existence,” “I am”) feel deliberate. At times the abstract register (“essence,” “verity,” “unified truth”) slightly distances us from bodily immediacy, but it does not undermine the POV’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by this peculiar, meticulous man’s sensibility, with good control of rhythm across long descriptive sentences and shorter, weighted beats (“Absolute silence.”). Lexicon and syntax are stable, and the perspective never drifts into unearned omniscience beyond what a close, reflective third can reasonably claim. Refrains like “eminently peculiar” and “fjord quiet” read as deliberate patterning rather than tics, and they support tone. The prose maintains clarity despite its lyricism, and psychic distance is managed smoothly over the counting sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s spatial and technical sensibilities, giving the narration a distinct texture. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with the contemplative, near-mystical tone of the setting and the character’s introspective state. Dialogue is clean and purposeful, though at times a touch too polished and aphoristic for spontaneous speech, especially in Kael’s thematic pronouncements. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent, and the narrative stance never slips into unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, reflective, and convincingly shaped by a probability professor’s daughter who also values poetry; diction like “lucid contradictions” and “the poetry of possibility” feels earned. Rhythm is well-controlled, with sentence length modulating to match reflective vs. experiential beats. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator never claims knowledge beyond Elara’s grasp. At times the narrative tilts into a slightly essayistic register, but it remains in character and doesn’t undermine the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct sonic and metaphorical texture, especially in the opening and the “melodically haunted” perception. POV remains stable and close, and the diction is largely consistent with a reflective, musically attuned sensibility. Dialogue is stylized but still plausible, and it carries subtext about control, ritual, and surrender without becoming purely expository. Rhythm modulates well from atmospheric description to the sharper beats of the call.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically controlled, and clearly filtered through Elara’s archivist mentality, with recurring diction (“gently thorough,” “weight,” “proximate causes”) that feels character-rooted. Rhythm varies well, with long, musical sentences balanced by occasional shorter beats at emotional pivots. There’s no POV slippage, and the elevated register fits both character and mode. At times the abstraction level rises (“context changes,” “haunted euphoria”) in ways that slightly smooth over the rawness of her inner state, keeping it just shy of the most distinctive voices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly tied to Elara’s sensibility and profession (logistical metaphors, attention to chains and systems). Diction remains consistent and elevated in a way that suits a reflective, contemplative piece. There are a few slightly meta or editorial lines (“This was the precise timeframe when the story changed”) that momentarily break the otherwise immersive focalization. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, distinct in tone between Elara’s brittle humor and the young woman’s vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and convincing, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in touch and vibration rather than sight. Diction and rhythm support a meditative, lyric mode without becoming opaque, and psychic distance is well controlled. Recurrent phrases (“quiet blaze,” “absorbed the forest’s language”) function as motif rather than scaffold most of the time. The voice is strong and consistent enough for publication, though not yet startlingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a signal interpreter steeped in metaphor and abstraction. Lexicon and rhythm are controlled, with recurring images (ink, loom, web, anomaly) giving the prose a distinct texture. Occasional thematic slogans feel more like authorial thesis than unmediated thought, but they don’t break POV coherence. Overall, the narrative stance feels polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly attuned to Elias’s sensibility, with a consistent metaphorical palette around tide, breath, and music. Diction is elevated but not implausible for this mode; Lily’s brief dialogue in sign reads simple and age-appropriate, giving good contrast. Psychic distance is well-controlled, sliding in and out of interiority smoothly. The one-quasi-omniscient flourish (“the town’s forgotten whispering advisor”) still feels compatible with the chosen stance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly heightened diction that suits Kael’s reflective, guilt-laden mindset. Phrasing like “analytically intuitive perception” and “volcanic tenderness” gives the prose a distinct texture and perceptual signature. At times the register edges toward purple or thematically loaded explanation, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity. There’s good modulation from hushed tension in the archive to the more spacious, quietly triumphant tone at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture of elevated, nearly mythic diction that matches the speculative setting. Psychic distance is steady; we remain in Kael’s sensibility even when the language is heightened beyond ordinary thought, reading as a stylized but coherent narrative filter. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, with good modulation between lush description and sharper, decisive beats (“He began his method without hesitation. / Drumming on everything.”). It doesn’t quite feel idiosyncratically Kael as a person so much as a refined authorial-lyric stance, but it remains effective.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and colored by Kael’s technical and sensory focus on sound and structure, giving the narration a distinct texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with a clear status shift as Vale moves from dismissive challenger to humbled learner. Occasional explanatory lines about the storm’s physics and the map’s principles edge toward didactic, but they fit Kael’s expert mindset and remain legible. Overall, point of view is well controlled with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person, slightly elevated omniscient voice is steady and confident, with a clear lyrical texture that matches the quiet, metaphysical mood. Word choice (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension”) is distinctive without becoming illegible, and psychic distance is consistent. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative stance feels deliberately more literary than character-bound, which works for this fable-like vignette. A few phrases verge on self-consciousness, but overall the voice is controlled and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias through Elias’s sensibility and his attunement to unspoken thoughts. Rhythm and diction are controlled; sentences vary in length and cadence to support the contemplative mood without losing clarity. The occasional high-register phrase fits the quasi-mythic tone rather than clashing with POV. There’s no head-hopping, and the occasional broader lens still feels anchored in Elias’s quietly visionary stance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a lyrical, maritime lexicon that feels suited to Elara’s history and gaze. Rhythm and sentence texture vary well, and moments like “the oars whispering secrets to the black water” or “combative tenderness—honoring the pain while choosing gentleness” show a distinct sensibility. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the diction edges into abstract thematic phrasing, but not enough to disrupt POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and distinct, marrying a theatrical sensibility with reflective lyricism in a way that plausibly fits Elias’s background as a performer. The dramatized narration of his own actions and the later softening into near-prayer demonstrate good control of distance and modulation. Lexicon occasionally skews abstract (“morally ambiguous regret,” “profound alchemy in his perception”) but remains within a believable register for this introspective, somewhat self-conscious character. POV boundaries are clean, with no leakage beyond his knowledge or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly tuned to the sensibility of an “aesthetically driven” poet, with images like “cloud-shadow,” “lantern-moth hush,” and “watercolor on wet paper” forming a recognizable perceptual signature. The incantatory rhythm during the paraphrased lines contrasts nicely with the descriptive cadence, giving the ritual its own sonic texture. There’s no POV slippage or register clash; the elevated diction feels intrinsic to this character and world. While the voice is lush, it remains legible and controlled rather than overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like premise, and it filters details convincingly through Elara’s tactile/sound-based perception and Kael’s craft. Dialogue sounds natural yet purposeful, advancing the stakes of silence versus song and perfection versus truth. There is minor drift toward an omniscient, authorial summarizing tone in the closing reflections, but not enough to confuse focalization. Rhythm and diction feel deliberate rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elara’s sensibility, with controlled rhythm and a coherent psychic distance throughout. Dialogue is slightly stylized but suits the quasi-mystical, philosophical confrontation and reliably advances the central argument. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge claims. Occasional didactic lines in dialogue edge toward authorial thesis-voice, but not enough to break the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a craftsperson in love with an astronomer (attention to brass, vellum, wire, folds, coordinates). Rhythm varies well between long, lush descriptive sentences and shorter beats at emotional peaks (“She leaned close. / And saw it.”). Register remains coherent, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion despite the reflective density. A slight tendency toward abstract, essay-adjacent phrasing in a few sentences is the only thing that keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well modulated, with a strong perceptual signature around materials, measurement, and pattern. Dialogue is spare but natural, distinct enough between Leo and Elara, and it advances both character and thematic exposition. The elevated diction fits the contemplative, quasi-mystical framing and feels coherent with Elara’s vocation. Occasional overtly essayistic formulations are the only mild tonal seams.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically elevated, and well-matched to a ritual in a lost-civilization archive, with nice textural phrases like “atoms of nostalgia” and “the faint, shimmering potential of atoms of nostalgia.” Psychic distance remains steady and appropriate; we never slip into knowledge Elara couldn’t have. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the voice modulates under pressure, tightening around the core atom beat. Occasionally the diction brushes purple (stacked abstractions in a few sentences), but not enough to undercut control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, and maintains a measured, reverent rhythm that fits her “softly deliberate” nature. Diction (“luminous regret,” “living, breathing metamorphosis”) is elevated but internally consistent and suited to the mythic tone. Occasional omniscient-feeling compressions (tracking the shadow’s work across decades) are plausibly anchored in her viewing of recordings and don’t break focalization. The lyric register risks uniformity but generally modulates enough to mark investigative tension versus reflective realization.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by Elara’s affinity for animals and environments; phrases like “with the precision of mending a broken wing” feel character-rooted. Rhythm and syntax are varied and generally controlled, supporting a contemplative, almost incantatory mood. At times, the register lifts into abstract, quasi-philosophical diction (“sacred synthesis,” “conceptual repricing”-adjacent phrasing) that sounds more like an essayist than a tired wildlife handler in the aftermath of a con. Still, the piece maintains a coherent focalization and perceptual signature without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like “meteor hush” and “evaporative patterns to find hidden geographies of memory and loss.” Diction and rhythm support the contemplative, slightly numinous mood without major register slips. Interior access and narrative stance remain stable; the plant telepathy is folded into her perception cleanly. At times the elevated, almost oracular language edges toward uniformity, but it remains controlled enough not to blur Elara’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s peculiar sensibility (mapping emotions as spaces, seeing sprocket holes as “the braille of lost time”). Rhythm varies effectively between longer, flowing sentences in reflective moments and shorter declaratives at structural pivots (“Elara opened her eyes.”). The diction—developer fluid, silver halides, spatial negative—feels both technically apt and thematically aligned, without register breaks. At times the lyricism risks uniformity of tone, but it never tips into confusion or overtly ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the subject matter. Diction and syntax show a deliberate rhythm—longer, flowing sentences for vision and memory, shorter for key turns like “And she surrendered completely.” There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how Elara reads the world (stones exhaling words, meteors as stitches in an unwritten calendar). At times, the voice leans toward generic “poetic” phrasing rather than fully idiosyncratic thought, but it never loses coherence or slips in register.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to this character’s emptied-but-purposeful mind. Diction like “fractured lullaby,” “wave functions,” and “occasionally everywhere” creates a recognizably singular texture without slipping registers. Psychic distance is well controlled, giving us both his abstract conceptual thinking and concrete bodily cues (boots, calloused palms, the archive’s weight). There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance itself feels confident and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Kael’s contemplative state and the surreal setting. Diction is mostly consistent and controlled, with patterned phrases like “hum of insight” and “wild frontier of your mind” reinforcing the conceptual frame. There is some drift into generalized, quasi-mystical register near the end that feels more authorial than character-bound, but it doesn’t break POV coherence. Rhythm and distance are handled with confidence overall.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled third-person lens closely tracking Elara’s experience and perceptions. Diction and rhythm match the contemplative, mythic tone; sentences vary enough to avoid monotony despite the lushness. Dialogue is natural for the archetypal, quasi-mystical guides and carries the tone, though both guides speak in a similar register. The accumulative, lullaby-like narration is deliberate and coherent, even if it sacrifices some sharpness and contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly Elara’s, with a strong perceptual bias toward tactile and architectural detail. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and key sentences carry emotional charge without losing clarity. The few bits of elevated diction (“seraphically mundane,” “conceptual cost of safety”) skirt the edge of feeling more authorial than character-bound but mostly fit the heightened, quasi-mythic tone. Overall, distance and access are well controlled and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The omniscient, high-register voice is confident, consistent, and well-suited to the mythic, cosmic scale, with controlled syntax and recurring phrasal rhythms that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction is elevated but coherent with the frame (“crease of eternity,” “regally unpretentious grace”) and creates a distinct narrative texture. There is no head-hopping, and the brief shift to Elara as focal point is cleanly handled within the same narrative stance. The one limitation is a certain evenness of tone that slightly blunts modulation at peak-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with repeated phrases (“drifting moored,” “periodically eternal”) functioning as intentional motifs rather than tics. Diction balances technical specificity (“sea level monitoring station,” “sensor array”) with poetic perception filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a scientist and mourner. The recording’s brief dialogue segment feels plausibly like her younger self and advances plot and theme. At times the register slides slightly into abstract, high-level phrasing, which marginally blurs the otherwise sharp perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to tactile sensation and cosmic imagery. Diction is elevated but plausibly filtered through a reflective protagonist and a lightly authorial narrative layer, and the cadence supports the meditative, ritualized feel of the scene. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated stance shifts. The limitation is that the voice remains at roughly one rich, “high” register throughout, with little modulation under peak beats, which slightly narrows its expressive range.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly rooted in Elara’s sensibility, especially in how it notices plant states and volcanic textures. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with good modulation between lush description and more clipped, purposeful beats during key actions (searching, unsealing). Dialogue, though brief, feels natural for the world and reveals character and theme without clunkiness. The voice is strong and specific, though the occasional overtly didactic phrasing slightly dulls its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent; diction is controlled, and the somatic-focus lexicon creates a recognizable narrative texture. Recurrent constructions (“This X was Y,” “Each sensation was…,” “The [object] embodied…”) provide a deliberate, meditative cadence that suits an accumulative design. However, the register sometimes shifts toward abstract/clinical (“somatic markers,” “core concept,” “motivation”) in ways that feel more like essay-side commentary than Elara’s in-the-moment sensibility. That slight distance and sameness of rhythm undercut the potential distinctiveness of the voice at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with an introspective, aesthetically attuned artist; diction like “liquid starlight” and “luminescent ache” feels character-appropriate rather than imposed. Rhetorical questions become a stylistic and psychological signature that tracks his evolving stance, and psychic distance stays steady and legible. There are no POV slips or expository intrusions; the narrative modulation from bleakness to charged purpose is smooth. Occasional repetition of key phrases skirts mannerism but largely reads as intentional motif rather than verbal crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture, with diction and attention filtered credibly through Kael’s sensibility as a tracker-mystic. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between description and climactic beats, and there is no POV leakage. At times the register edges toward abstract generality in the explanatory paragraph, which slightly blunts the otherwise sharp perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to cold, silence, and ritual detail. Diction is elevated but plausible for a highly trained archivist in this world, and the brief dialogue with Kael feels natural, carrying subtext (suspicion, concealment) efficiently. The narrative handles psychic distance well, zooming in under pressure without losing clarity. Occasionally the register edges toward grandiose abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on quiet, texture, and small sensory shifts. Phrases like “senselessly perceptive nature” and “profound engraved quiet” establish a distinct stylistic pattern that the story maintains without head-hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, blending sensory-strange worldbuilding with Elara’s focused, calm interiority.

The “perceptual signature” (thinking in sound, pattern, and silence) is distinctive and stable throughout. There’s minimal exposition and no head-hopping or stance confusion, supporting a confident narrative presence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and suitably elevated for both the setting and Elara’s background, with a consistent perceptual signature that favors logic, pattern, and aesthetic detail. Diction choices like “proof by contradiction” and “orbits of regret” feel organically tied to her mind rather than grafted-on cleverness. There is some tendency toward slightly uniform lyricism across beats, but it does not break POV plausibility or clarity. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and distinctive without slipping into opacity or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture (e.g., “grandfather clocks ticked in reverse,” “meteor hush”) that suits the speculative, emotional frame. POV boundaries are clean; we never slip outside Elara’s knowledge, and the narration’s elevated diction feels aligned with her sensibility as an artist attuned to sound and stars. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well with intensity, tightening around the recognition of her niece’s cry and softening in the aftermath. A few grand abstractions brush against sentimentality, but they do not break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends emotional synesthesia (“brittle crack of a surrendered grudge”) and sensory detail. POV boundaries are clean; we never leave Elara’s frame, and the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer in this quasi-mystical space. Rhythm and diction modulate well with intensity—the prose lengthens and softens as the hush deepens, then sharpens again as she exits the grotto. At times the register flirts with being a touch abstract, but it remains anchored enough in her artist’s sensibility to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with controlled lyricism and a clear perceptual signature (reliance on architectural and elemental metaphors, attention to absence as much as presence). Diction like “aberrant mercy,” “retro­cognitive trap,” and “fragment of heaven salvaged from hell” coheres as one textured narrative stance rather than feeling like register drift. There are moments of essay-like abstraction, but they mostly remain grounded in Elara’s worldview rather than authorial intrusion. POV control is tight, with no leaks or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a clear perceptual signature: synesthetic cross-sensory mapping, theatrical vocabulary, and a consistent, elevated register. Psychic distance is steady, and the third-person close focalization through Elara never wavers or leaks omniscient knowledge. Rhythm and diction modulate reasonably well with intensity, with more lushness around the echo-weaving and a quieter cadence at release. At times the lyricism verges on uniform high gear, which risks slight saturation but does not genuinely confuse or flatten the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending sensory attentiveness with mildly scientific/reflective diction that fits an “affectionate skeptic” artist. Phrases like “somatic markers,” “fraktally precise,” and “unpredictable somatic resonance” push toward a theoretical register but feel grounded in Elara’s worldview rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose alive, and interior access remains stable with no head-hopping. The voice handles lyric moments and explanatory ones without losing coherence, though occasional abstraction slightly distances us from the immediate emotional heat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by Elara’s sensory vocation and the planet’s “slow breath.” Diction and rhythm are mostly well controlled, with varied sentence shapes and a confident, contemplative stance.

Elias’s perceptual signature—codes, locks, silence, and careful physical detail—feels consistent, and the narrative doesn’t slip into omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially Anya’s two key lines which simultaneously acknowledge history and offer guarded hope. The voice occasionally edges toward uniform solemnity, but control of distance and rhythm remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close-third voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“palimpsest promise,” “spindrift serenity,” “percolate slowly through the filter of the present moment”—that matches Silas’s contemplative attention. POV is stable and modest; we never slip into knowledge he couldn’t plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, flowing sentences in reflection and crisper beats around the final *plink* and ferry embarkation. A hint of elevated diction edges toward authorial, but it remains coherent as a unified narrative stance rather than feeling like register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (attention to stone, sky, hum, and memory). Diction like “brittle awakening,” “ancestral patience,” and “paper-and-ozone-scented halls” coheres tonally and suits a reflective, high-fantasy mode. POV access remains stable; we never drift into knowledge Elara couldn’t have, and the Kaelen memories are properly marked as recovered experience. At times the register veers toward slightly abstracted exposition when stating theme, but not enough to undermine the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-attuned to Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction (“prismatic quiet,” “tangible unity”) that matches the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical specificity (“Fane Acoustics weave,” C-sharp floorboard) with lyric reflection in a way that matches Leo’s background and mindset.

Occasional elevated abstractions are still within plausible reach for this educated, self-analytical character. Overall, the perceptual signature—facts as comfort, sound and objects as anchors—feels unified and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close-third voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Aris’s educated, reflective sensibility, smoothly integrating technical and archaic diction (harmonic resonator, Akkadian phrase, cuneiform tablets). Rhythm and syntax modulate well with emotional intensity, especially around the planting and the humming response. There’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition; backstory is cleanly anchored to present stimuli. A couple of lines slide toward generic uplift, but they don’t break the overall voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“wintersun,” “sea’s slow pulse,” “titan-gears hum a resonant song”). Narrative distance remains stable and appropriate to a meditative, quasi-sacred frame; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction flirts with purple, but cadences are varied and the voice feels unified rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture and is largely consistent with a reflective, technically minded man in an extraordinary space. His professional lexicon (blast doors, air filtration cycles) mingles with more mystical diction to create a recognizable perceptual signature. At times, the register slides into abstract, essayistic phrasing that feels more like authorial commentary than character-specific thought, slightly weakening distance control. Overall, the voice is strong and coherent, but the high lyricism occasionally over-smooths or generalizes his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Elara-specific, blending technical river language with heightened emotional perception. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—longer, textured sentences for observation, tighter ones around key actions like pressing middle C. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even the more abstract lines feel like her thought-pattern, not authorial intrusion. A few thematic declaratives brush against an essayistic register but don’t fracture the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by Elara’s sensibility, with a strong feel for cadence and image. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic frame and never drifts into incongruous registers. The narrative distance stays stable, moving smoothly between external detail and interiority without head-hopping or confusing shifts. Rhythmic control is good, with long, flowing sentences supporting wonder and shorter ones crystallizing key realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture (“mulberry ache,” “soul tuned to forgotten whispers”) that feels consistent with Elara’s sensibility and the story’s magic-real framework. The narrative distance is stable, with interior access and external description well integrated, and there’s no head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively at the climax—the glacier/cracking sound sentence and the violin’s dissolution are particularly well controlled. At times the voice edges toward uniformly elevated/ornate, which risks a slight sameness of cadence, but it remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s ritualistic, quasi-religious sensibility. Diction like “radiant hush,” “celestial luminescence,” and “star-song” forms a recognizable perceptual signature that suits the world. The rhythm modulates reasonably well—occasional short lines like “Minutes stretched like spun glass” punctuate longer, flowing sentences. At times the elevated register flirts with sameness, but it remains controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a recognizable cadence that suits the meditative content. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with an ageless, quasi-mythic perspective on a sixty-year caretaker. At times, the narrative drifts toward essayistic abstraction and meta-commentary, slightly distancing us from embodied immediacy. Still, POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (ritual focus, attention to cycles) remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture suited to the quasi-mythic tone, and Elara’s perceptual filter (wind as instrument, chime-reading) is distinct. Dialogue is slightly heightened but coherent with the story’s register and carries subtext about guilt, responsibility, and permission to change. A few abstractions (“protected vulnerability,” “sincerely insincere reassurance”) lean toward critical vocabulary rather than pure in-scene perception, modestly distancing us from POV.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinctive, mildly elevated lyric register that fits both character and subject. Diction (“vanishing,” “latent magnetism,” “reversing bones”) and syntax work together to create a recognizable narrative texture without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the voice drifts toward reflective essay rather than sensuous scene, but it never fully breaks the established mode. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and stable, with enough rhythmic variation to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Corbin yet elevated, with a distinct lyrical texture that fits the mythic, ritualistic frame. Diction (“historically reverent to his marrow,” “echo-weavers,” “a living river of shadow and light”) feels like an extension of his sensibility rather than generic fantasy-speak. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, modulating from long, baroque sentences in descriptive passages to tighter lines at key turns (“A sharp cry split the air.”). There’s no POV leakage or awkward shifts, though the uniform loftiness occasionally risks smoothing over emotional jaggedness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with a consistent lexicon and imagistic logic. Rhythm is well-managed: long, flowing sentences suit the contemplative journey, while key realizations are given sharper, shorter emphasis. The narrative confidently balances mythic diction (“lingering luminance,” “accommodated impossibilities”) with concrete sensory anchors, avoiding register clashes. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the prose feels like a distinct, deliberate narrative presence rather than generic fantasy voice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a lamplighter and quiet obsessive. Diction and rhythm support the hushed, reverent tone, and the voice modulates appropriately as he moves from controlled observation into emotional vulnerability. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence about what he knows or infers feels plausible. The main limitation is a tendency toward uniformly elevated lyricism that slightly flattens modulation in places where a sharper, plainer rhythm could better mark key inflection points.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinctive blend of cosmic-technical language (“wavelength align,” “resonant frequency”) and ritualistic solemnity that feels specific to Elara’s mindset and station. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the perspective never slips or overreaches beyond what she could plausibly infer. At times, the register leans toward abstract or slightly grandiose phrasing, but it’s mostly justified by the far-future, end-of-universe vantage point. Overall the narrative stance feels assured and coherent, supporting the lyric, meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrically inclined, and consistent in register, with a good rhythmic mix of long, lush sentences and shorter emphatic ones at emotional peaks (“Kael’s breath stilled.”). The perceptual lens clearly belongs to someone steeped in ritual, grief, and cosmic imagery, and the diction matches the mythic-fantasy frame. However, the voice leans somewhat toward a generalized elevated fantasy-narrator rather than a sharply idiosyncratic Kael-specific idiom, which slightly flattens distinctiveness. There are no POV slips or expository intrusions to undercut it.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet coherent with the fable-like, contemplative frame, and POV distance remains stable and clean. Syntax and diction exhibit a distinct texture—“physics of faith,” “brittle devotion,” “plausible impossibility”—without sliding into academic or out-of-POV register. Rhythmic control is good: long, ornate sentences in descriptive and reflective passages, tighter phrasing at key beats like the first *plink* and the erupting chime. The voice feels unified and intentional across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to artifacts, light, and sensory echoes of memory. Register shifts into bureaucratic language (“Expunge all personal artifacts”) feel motivated by Elara’s job and theme rather than arbitrary. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance holds steady, with occasional zooms in and out handled smoothly. At moments, the narrator’s diction tilts more toward abstract essayistic phrasing than toward felt, in-the-body noticing, which slightly blurs the edge between character and authorial voice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent in register, with a clear perceptual signature that blends precise observation and poetic metaphor. Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive, and the elevated diction suits an introspective alchemist in a mythic setting. Even when the prose leans abstract (“the delicate alchemy of self”), it remains anchored in Elara’s concerns and vocabulary rather than drifting into generic omniscience. There is minor drift toward essayistic phrasing in the final thematic statements, but not enough to fracture POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elara’s preoccupation with patterns and silence. Diction like “attentively inventive” and “harmonic spiral” fits the quasi-mystical, technical watcher persona. Dialogue is minimal but natural and functional, with Vance’s warmth highlighting the relational stakes. At times the register leans slightly abstract, but not enough to disrupt coherence or character plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction that suits a contemplative SF-mystic tone. Phrases like “I am the silence after the storm” and “midwife life from loss” show a consistent rhetorical texture without major register breaks. There’s occasional overlap with therapeutic or abstract language, yet it doesn’t shatter the established aesthetic. Overall, the POV and narrative stance feel unified and confident, even if not utterly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s temperament and vocation, with patterned phrases like “storm-born silence” and “nocturnal haven” giving it a distinct texture. The narrative distance stays stable and confident, and the reflective mode suits the low-action, high-idea premise. Some diction veers toward abstract or elevated in ways that feel more authorial than character-bound, especially in thematic declarations. Still, rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, and the perceptual signature remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Elias’s ritualized grief and sensory focus. Rhythms modulate appropriately: longer, incantatory lines around the ritual, slightly sharper beats at the moment of laughter and at the house’s exhalation. Lexicon and imagery are cohesive, with wind, sound, and dust motifs binding the voice. There is some repetition in constructions and favored terms, but it feels like intentional litany more than uncontrolled drift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture of bookish, mystical diction that matches a feral library guardian’s consciousness. Rhythm and syntax support the contemplative, foggy tone while remaining legible, and psychic distance stays consistent. Abstract nouns are occasionally stacked, but the pattern is taught early and feels intentional rather than like register drift or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature focused on light, cold, and subtle vibrations of matter. Diction and rhythm generally fit the mythic-fantastical register and modulate appropriately as pressure rises and then resolves. Occasional abstract phrases (“core concept,” “creative destruction” named as such) momentarily pull away from embodied immediacy but don’t break POV coherence. Overall, the voice feels unified and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and distinctively lyrical, with a consistent blend of technical and mystical diction that feels true to a “celestial signal interpreter.” Rhythm and syntax modulate well between description and interior action, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The perceptual signature—attending to cables, frequencies, and resonance—keeps the narration anchored in Elara’s sensibility. A touch of abstraction in thematic lines keeps it from feeling utterly singular at the highest tier, but control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and confident, with a controlled lyrical register that suits the quasi-mystical premise. Phrasing like “timeframe when clocks run sideways” and “resiliently positive spirit” establishes a distinct narrative texture that remains stable under pressure. At times the diction feels a bit more elevated and ornate than what we’d expect filtered strictly through a ferry deckhand’s sensibility, but the stance reads as an external narrator closely following Leo rather than pure free indirect style, so it doesn’t break plausibility. Rhythm and sentence variation are strong and support mood.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon of perception (static, lattices, threads, harmonics) that feels native to Elara’s mind and vocation. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with longer, lush sentences at calmer beats and tighter phrasing at key ruptures. There is no head-hopping, and the elevated diction fits the quasi-mystical, conceptual frame. The register is uniform enough that we sometimes feel the authorial lyricism more than a fully individuated psyche, but it remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear sensibility that favors solemn, image-rich narration. Kael’s perception colors the prose convincingly, and dialogue sounds natural enough while still carrying the elevated tone of the setting and stakes. The rhythmic patterning of sentences generally works, though the register sometimes edges toward abstraction and repetition (“somber marvel,” “unfolded horizons,” “balancedly curious”) in ways that flatten distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is strong and coherent but could benefit from a touch more textural variety and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close POV on Elara is stable and well-controlled, with a lyrical yet consistent narrative voice. Diction and rhythm suit the quasi-sacred atmosphere, and interior access aligns with what she can plausibly know and observe. Dialogue is sparse but effective and distinct—Lily’s “He called it our courage rose” feels age-appropriate and carries subtext. At times, the elevated register approaches uniformity across beats, but it remains coherent rather than drifting or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture and metaphor palette (“concrete throat,” “cathedral of forgotten science,” “crashing hush”) that feel like one mind processing this ordeal. Psychic distance is well-managed, tightening around fear and loosening into reverent observation in the main chamber. Diction is elevated but mostly plausible for an introspective spelunker with scientific family background; it rarely breaks character or becomes abstracted. There are a few moments where the narrative register (“Phase Transition Array,” “alchemical marvel”) strains toward authorial rather than purely character voice, but they still serve the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with motifs (heartbeats, shard, ghost) woven in a disciplined way. Diction is elevated but controlled, matching the quasi-mystical/technological observatory setting and her reflective state. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the narrative distance stays tight enough to feel intimate while allowing occasional thematic altitude. At times the register brushes against sermon-like abstraction, but the underlying perceptual signature remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confident and consistent, with a strong lyrical texture: phrases like “skeletal cathedrals” and “captured constellation of meaning” feel unified rather than showy for its own sake. Third-person focus stays tight to Elara’s perceptions, and the diction matches a mythic, ceremonial mode without register slips. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from becoming sing-song despite high imagery density. The same poise persists under the peak moment, though a slightly sharper modulation of urgency there could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice around Aris is consistent and controlled, marrying scientific diction (“hygrometer,” “cryptid”) with lyric perception in a way that feels like her, not generic omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying stakes and belief clashes without expository clunk. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and psychic distance is managed cleanly through the transformation sequence. Occasional abstractions and overt thematic phrasing prevent the voice from feeling fully singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with a good mix of concrete image and elevated diction. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between the hushed, tentative opening and the more expansive, symphonic ending. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the heart-rhythm conceit is handled without expository over-explaining. At times the voice leans toward the uniformly poetic, but it remains controlled and character-coherent rather than generically ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrically inflected, and clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility, with repeated attention to ritual, quiet, and small acts of care. Sentence rhythm varies and generally matches the contemplative but tense mood of the scene. Some lines drift into abstract, declarative characterization that feels more like authorial gloss than lived perception, but these don’t break the POV. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and controlled enough for high-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s craft and history; diction choices like “whispering gleam” and “quietly persistent grace” form a recognizable tonal signature. Psychic distance is controlled and stable, with no head-hopping or register slips, and the narrative modulates rhythm effectively as emotion intensifies (the singing sequence tightens and grows warmer). The main risk is a slight sameness of elevated register across beats, which flattens potential dynamic range in places.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture marrying scientific and poetic registers (“rational poetry of order,” “city lights glittering like distant stanzas”). Diction and rhythm suit Elara’s mind and the contemplative mood, and the brief dialogue with her grandmother sounds natural and age-appropriate. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving from observed ballet of patrons to intimate tactile focus on the scarf without jarring shifts. Occasional high-register abstractions are still in character and do not break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and sensorially rich, with a consistent diction that suits a contemplative, artistically inclined protagonist. Phrasings like “the hush of improbable beginnings” and “luminous absence” give the prose a recognizable signature, and the narrative distance is well-controlled. At times, the lyricism risks sameness—similar cadences and glowing abstractions recur without enough textural contrast in higher-pressure beats. Even so, the voice remains coherent, legible, and aesthetically confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the story’s quasi-mythic mode, with a clear perceptual signature centered on thresholds, light, and emotional nuance. The narrative distance stays stable, blending close access to the locksmith’s motives with a gently omniscient sweep (e.g., cutting to Elara, the “bones of the world”) without head-hopping confusion. Rhythms are varied and mostly controlled, using long, sinuous sentences to build atmosphere and shorter ones to mark key turns. At times the diction drifts toward grandiosity, but it remains legible and coherent with the chosen tone.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly textured, with a clear perceptual signature (tactile, object-focused, ritualistic). Diction and rhythm suit a reflective, field-notebook-minded folklorist without drifting into academic jargon or generic lyricism. The brief quoted dialogue from Elara is simple and human, contrasting nicely with the more ornate narration. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around the alignment and memory return without head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Kael’s reflective, meticulous sensibility; diction like “cartography,” “geometry,” and “mosaic” feels organic to him. Dialogue is slightly elevated but suits the mythic, ritualized tone and clearly distinguishes Kael’s composed, metaphor-rich speech from Elara’s blunt skepticism. Psychic distance is well handled, with enough interior access to Kael to ground his anxieties without drifting into omniscient commentary. The only limitation is that the voice occasionally risks over-smoothness, leaving less room for raw, jagged phrasing that might match the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated and consistent, creating a distinct mythic texture that suits the fable-like premise. POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narration’s certainty matches the magical-realist mode. At times the diction feels more like an authorial lyric essay than the filtered interiority of a 70-year-old pruner (“core concept of her life’s work unfolded visually”), softening character-specificity. Nonetheless, rhythm and imagery are controlled enough that the pattern reads intentional and coherent through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct, almost ritualistic cadence that fits both character and setting. Diction like “interlaced hush,” “silent rivers of sapphire and silver,” and “lucid unrest” feels purposeful rather than randomly elevated, and interior access remains stable through Elara. Occasional abstract formulations are grounded quickly by concrete sensory detail, so the lyricism rarely drifts into vagueness. The voice might benefit from one or two sharper, plainer beats under peak stress to create more dynamic modulation, but overall it is confident and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual habits and sensibility. Diction and rhythm have a distinct texture—densely metaphoric but not incoherent—and the narrative distance stays stable. The voice modulates gently with discovery, but emotional valence remains subdued, in keeping with the character’s shielded openness. A slight tendency toward abstract, thesis-like sentences keeps it from feeling utterly effortless at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, marrying technical diction (“viscosity,” “terminal velocity,” “vectors of surrender”) with lyrical phrasing in a way that feels true to an analytic diver haunted by loss. Psychic distance is stable, and the narration rarely claims knowledge beyond what Aris could plausibly infer. Rhythms modulate well between dense description and more spacious reflective lines, maintaining legibility. A slight tendency toward elevated, thesis-like statements near the end is the main check on an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with coined phrases like “tinkersong wonder” giving the narration a recognizable texture. POV distance is consistent; we never slip into information Elara could not plausibly frame in this mythic-omniscient register. Rhythms are generally well controlled, with a good mix of sentence lengths and a clear sense of cadence around key beats (lightning, final carving, thunder). The main limitation is that the lyricism sometimes feels more generically poetic than singularly Elara-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and consistent with Kael’s temperament, with controlled rhythm and elevated but fitting diction. His perceptions—prismatic light, cloud-whales, crystalline ramparts—feel like a distinct sensibility rather than generic fantasy description. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory intrusions that break the spell. The register verges on uniformly elevated, which smooths out some potential textural variety but remains technically assured.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by Aris’s professional and emotional lenses. Syntax and rhythm are varied and generally well-controlled, with recurring phrases (“quietly explosive,” “dusty starlight”) functioning as intentional motifs rather than tics. The narration’s certainty stays within what Aris can plausibly infer; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few lines verge on summary-omniscience (“had not merely categorized clouds; had proven…”) but they don’t materially disrupt the prevailing point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, with a distinct tactile perceptual signature that fits Elara’s condition and artistic focus. Lexicon and rhythm are controlled and consistent, and there’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. The modulation from hushed lyricism to the sharper beats of demolition works without breaking tone. A few abstracted thematic sentences slightly flatten the otherwise embodied, sensuous voice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently controlled, with lyrical yet coherent diction (“sociable isolation,” “stranded luminance”) that feels suited to Elara’s sensibility. Narrative distance stays stable; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The prose rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and more focused, procedural beats as she deciphers the pattern. Some heightened phrasing skirts purple, but it still reads intentional and character-compatible rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature centered on tools, light, and texture that fits Elara’s craft. Syntax and diction are elevated but coherent, supporting the mythic-fantasy register without sliding into academic abstraction or breaking POV plausibility. Psychic distance stays steady, and the narrative modulation from hushed to humming at the repair beat is controlled and purposeful. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries mood and interiority effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic tone of the piece. Dialogue differentiates characters enough—Kael’s brusquer skepticism versus Lena’s more perceptive calm—and remains functional and natural within the stylized world. The narrative distance hovers at a controlled, omniscient middle, allowing quick dips into different characters’ reactions without confusion or head-hopping artifacts. While the voice is polished and pleasant, its texture feels more uniformly “beautiful” than distinctly tied to any single consciousness, keeping it just below the most distinctive tier.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confidently lyric, with a strong perceptual signature—cosmic abstractions are consistently filtered through Elara’s bodily experience and emotional vocabulary. Rhythm and diction show control: long, lush sentences carry metaphysical imagery while shorter ones (“The clock’s hands met at midnight.”) land structural beats. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping; distance is modulated intentionally to move between vast stakes and intimate detail (dust tracks, breath, puppet cracks). A touch of elevated phrasing in thematic lines verges on uniform solemnity, but overall the voice feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, clear, and mostly well-tuned to Elara’s vantage, with controlled access and no head-hopping. Phrasing like “offhandedly exact” and “life-saving. No poetry, only purpose.” gives the narration some textural character. However, the voice sits close to a polished genre-fantasy default rather than feeling uniquely idiosyncratic, and psychic distance stays fairly even, rarely tightening in moments of peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, blending technical lexicon (“monomers,” “surfactants,” “fluid dynamics”) with musical-metaphorical perception in a way that feels character-specific. Narrative distance is well controlled, staying interior without drifting into omniscience, and the rhythmic variation of sentences generally supports the lyric, reflective mode. Occasional didactic lines that summarize insight rather than embody it slightly flatten the otherwise strong texture. Overall, the POV feels assured and stable, appropriate for an accumulative, contemplative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture of elevated diction and sensuous imagery that matches the metaphysical focus. Phrasing like “cool as a forgotten secret” and “liquid marble” shows a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic prettiness. Psychic distance remains steady and appropriate; there’s no head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts. Occasionally the register drifts toward essayistic abstraction, but it stays within the established style and doesn’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct sensory lexicon tied to taste, kitchen discipline, and physical textures (“umami of hard-won wisdom,” “sandpaper rough memories”). POV is stable and confident; the narrative doesn’t leak into information Aris couldn’t plausibly intuit. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer cadences supporting the meditative tone and shorter beats punctuating moments of strain. A few metaphoric clusters verge on density, but they read as intentional stylistic richness rather than loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Elara’s perception: musical, mechanical, and linguistic metaphors dominate in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic purple prose. Syntax varies nicely, with long cadenced sentences for atmosphere and shorter declaratives at key turns (“Outside, the silence shattered.”) that manage rhythm well. There is no head-hopping; the limited third-person deep focus holds throughout, and diction maintains a coherent elevated register. At times the language leans toward saturation (multiple tapestry/bridge/connection images), which slightly blurs edges but doesn’t materially harm clarity or stance control.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady and distinctive, blending technical diction (“synaptic plasticity,” “helical structures”) with lyric description in a way that matches a scientifically trained, spiritually seeking protagonist. The narrative distance is well controlled, sliding closer as she trembles and weeps without head-hopping or stance confusion. There are occasional moments of slightly essayistic phrasing, but they feel character-appropriate rather than generic exposition. Rhythm varies reasonably well, with long, sinuous sentences for reverie and sharper beats at key emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a consistent, slightly elevated lexicon that fits a hypersensitive archivist and a fantastical scholarly setting. The "prism-mind" perceptual signature—emotional residue on parchment, geological whispers in stone—gives the narration distinct texture and filters description through her sensibility. Rhythm varies well enough to avoid monotony, though a few phrases and constructions recur (“latent blaze,” “clandestinely luminous”) in ways that start to feel mannered. Overall, distance and access are well controlled and the voice feels unified.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility, with phrases like “tree-song sculptor” and “every dewdrop a suspended note” giving a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm support the meditative, reverent mood without noticeable POV slippage or register breaks. The narration confidently blends internal perception with external description in a unified tone.

Still, POV control and narrative stance are confident and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)

Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical, ritualistic sensibility, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall, the voice feels distinctive without becoming mannered enough to impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a distinct sensory bias, especially toward smell, which suits the character. Phrasing like “wildflower hush” and “the turning of the tide’s thought” gives the prose a recognizable texture without losing clarity. A few word choices (“olfactorily sensitive,” “to journalize”) feel slightly clinical or awkward against the otherwise organic lyricism, preventing a higher score. POV control itself is clean and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyric third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the meditative, fantastical premise, with a distinct texture in images like “floating rock arches hung like forgotten stone tears.” Psychic distance is stable and appropriate; we’re close enough to Kael to share his perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive authorial commentary.

Occasional lines drift toward generic spiritual phrasing, but overall the voice feels unified and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)

Phrasing like “hazy precision” and “the wind wasn’t just pushing—it was singing the metal to failure” demonstrate a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. A slight tendency toward essayistic abstraction in a few lines keeps it just shy of exceptional, but it’s still very strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled, elevated diction that suits the mythic, ritual frame and Elara’s synesthetic sensibility. The perceptual signature—translating sound into color and cosmic correspondences—is strong and unified, and there is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” drift. Rhythm varies well between long, incantatory sentences and sharper beats like “She struck the bell,” which land with emphasis. Occasional abstraction and stacked modifiers flirt with purple prose but remain legible and pattern-taught, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, elevated, and distinctly textured, with a clear perceptual signature (ritualistic attention to objects, cosmological metaphors, and sonic language). Diction like “sonic architecture of resonance and intent” fits this world and character, even if it occasionally brushes purple. There’s good rhythmic control, with longer, meditative sentences matching the introspective ritual and a measured slowing at closure. It’s confident and controlled, though a hair less ornamentation would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a consistent perceptual palette (cold stone, aurora, vibration) that feels anchored in Kael’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity—more expansive and incantatory as the magic unfolds, calmer at the end. Occasionally, the narration slides into slightly authorial abstractions (“a living bridge built across the fade from memory to myth”) that feel less like Kael’s interior lexicon and more like external commentary. Still, POV remains stable and legible, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-matched to an observant mystic—elevated but not pompous, with controlled lyricism (“shifted hush,” “clarified purpose”).

    The close third-person voice is stable, gently elevated, and lyrically consistent with the mythic-fantasy register. Diction (“coax resilience from rubble,” “eternal azure light”) is controlled and largely character-compatible given the fable-like stance. There are no POV slips or tense issues, and the brief spoken line fits the established tone. Some repetition of favored constructions and adjectives keeps the voice from feeling completely singular at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical SF texture filtered through Elara’s sensory and professional preoccupations. Diction like “vacuum-leached air” and “forgotten prayers” feels of a piece with the world and character. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is well controlled. At peak intensity the voice leans on slightly generic abstractions (“energy turning volatile,” “steady rhythm of understanding”) but maintains coherence and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a rich, lyrical texture that suits the reflective, ritualized moment. Elias’s perceptual signature—tide-measured attention, stone and sea metaphors, focus on microphysical detail—feels coherent. There is mild distance between his supposed reticence and the ornate narration, suggesting a slightly more authorial lyricism than his likely inner diction, but it remains believable as free indirect style. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to carry emotional beats without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and textured, with a distinct lyrical timbre that feels plausibly aligned with this mythic-yet-tech-aware world.

There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the voice feels distinct rather than generic-fantasy-lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-matched to a character whose life centers on patient, meticulous tending; diction like “quantified sorrow” and “liquid silver” feels consistent with the quasi-mystical, quasi-technical frame. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping and no unjustified omniscience beyond what a close, reflective narrator could plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates nicely, lingering in long, cadenced lines for reflection and tightening around the pin’s fall and the moonlight’s arrival. Occasional abstract phrases slightly blur Elara’s individual idiom, but not enough to disturb the strong overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette that matches Elara’s interior state and the world’s strangeness. Diction and rhythm show control—rich but not incoherent—and psychic distance stays stable, giving us her perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive authorial explanation. Patterned phrases like “woven dawns” and “sacred loom” feel intentional motifs rather than mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, consistently close to Elara’s sensibility, and carries a distinctive lyric texture without losing clarity. Phrasing like “comforting unease” and “truce of hush” creates a recognizable tonal palette, and the modulation from hush to rupture to restored calm is well handled. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character: Silas’s outburst is blunt; Elara’s speech is precise and clipped under pressure. Occasionally the diction drifts a bit abstract (“fragile anatomy,” “scientific precision”), but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct sensibility that fuses scientific skepticism and sensual, almost mystical perception (“the electric hum of the aurora borealis,” “the earth tasting our hearts”).

The elevated diction and patterned phrases feel intentional and suited to the speculative-literary mode rather than artificially inflated. There’s room to vary cadence more at peak moments, but overall the voice is assured and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with a highly sensate, artistic consciousness; diction like “auroral luminescence” and “crystalline clarity” fits the heightened, magical setting. POV control is clean with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times the register edges toward uniform grandiosity, risking flattening emotional peaks into one high pitch. Still, the perceptual signature—charcoal, light, stone, memory—is distinct and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and attuned to Elara’s sensibility; diction around plants, metal, and script feels unified and character-appropriate. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with a confident control of pacing between dense description and shorter, declarative lines. In a few late sentences the narrative stance drifts toward authorial essay (“In a world starved of water, honesty was the deepest oasis”), but this doesn’t break POV coherence so much as soften its edge. Dialogue, when present, is simple and believable, serving subtext and theme efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct sensorium tied to sound and light that feels authentic to a “bell tuner.” Diction and rhythm are controlled and largely stable, modulating gently at the crescendo without becoming overwrought or breaking POV.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice around Unit Seven is consistent, with a pleasing blend of technical precision and lyricism that suits a nostalgic caretaker android. Rhythms modulate well between descriptive lushness and concise, procedural description during the ritual, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few sentences slip toward essayistic or explanatory register (“This was the action of miniaturize…”) that slightly flattens the otherwise distinctive texture. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong and coherent, just short of the exceptional sharpness demanded for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)

Phrases like “sandstorm calm” and “stored the fragment like a pressed flower” give the narration a distinct texture without destabilizing POV. Dialogue is brief but natural and differentiated by speaker role (neighbor, barista, official). The main weakness is a slight slide into explanatory abstraction in the closing lines, where voice serves theme a bit more than character.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive texture—metaphors of weaving, web-spinning, and dance recur in a controlled pattern that matches Elara’s identity as a "lyrical code breaker." Psychic distance is well handled: we remain inside her sensorium and thought-patterns without omniscient leakage, and shifts in rhythm (from long, flowing sentences to crisper action around the chime and valve turn) track emotional intensity. At times, the lyric register nudges toward uniform elevation, but not enough to break plausibility or blur her perceptual signature. Overall, the voice feels confident and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical without losing clarity, with a consistent third-person-limited focus through Elara’s perceptions and occupational lens.

There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; everything we know tracks plausibly with Elara’s awareness. A few turns of phrase edge toward the ornate, but they stay in register with the story’s mythic, contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias, with consistent diction like “terrestrially cosmic” and “liquid lullaby.” Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with a deliberate, meditative cadence that fits the ritual mode and modulates slightly at key beats (locating the fracture, releasing the hush).

At times, the elevated register risks mannered repetition, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and gently lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias around buildings, objects, and ritual. Dialogue feels natural, efficiently carries exposition and theme, and the two speakers are subtly distinct in rhythm and register.

Overall, the voice is polished and fitting for quiet literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a scientifically minded yet newly ritual-attuned protagonist.

Rhythm modulates nicely around key moments (the click, the silence, the resumed dripping), giving the prose a distinct musicality. A few abstract phrases drift toward the generalized (“profound peace of a burden finally laid down”), but they don’t significantly blunt the voice’s authority.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sound, resonance, and stone; phrases like “vibration felt in marrow, not ear” feel character-specific rather than generic. POV remains clean and stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond what fits a slightly mythic register. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively between incantatory description and more direct narrative progression. Occasional repeated formulations (“richly perceptive,” “web of intrigue,” “reed-blown melancholy”) are noticeable but read as motif rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)

    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits literary SF and Elara’s analytical mindset. The focalization stays tight to her perceptions and inferences, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain flow, though the voice feels more like refined narrator-consciousness than intensely idiosyncratic character-voice. A bit more lexical and rhythmic signature tied specifically to Elara could lift it into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient-leaning narrative voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear taste for metaphor and mythic phrasing that suits the prophetic frame. Focalization shifts between Elara, Hemlock, Valerius, Lena, and the village are cleanly signaled in content even without hard section breaks, and the distance remains steady enough not to feel like head-hopping. Elara’s “lyrically prophetic cadence” in dialogue contrasts naturally with more grounded mentions of net-mending and military scoffing, preserving character distinction despite the elevated narration. At times, the diction leans abstract (“variant allegiance,” “collaborative unfolding”), but overall the voice feels deliberate rather than generic.

Elara’s perceptual focus on horizons, celestial cycles, and stone reflects her role and gives the narration a distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident, lush, and consistent, with a distinct syntactic and metaphorical signature ("a stubborn flea on a furious green beast," "bell ringing in the key of pure potential"). Third-person close sticks cleanly to Elara’s sensibility while allowing some lyric altitude, and the modulation from playful irreverence to awed exultation at the climax feels organic. Diction choices match the quasi-steampunk, mythic-science register and rarely clash with her implied education or context.

Occasional high-register abstractions (“survival’s symphony,” “Conceptual fold”) nibble at the edge of over-crafted, but they don’t materially disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear texture in metaphors (“cedar beams glowing like liquid honey,” “fingers unclenching like buds trusting spring”). Occasional dips into Clara’s and Liam’s memories feel like controlled omniscience rather than sloppy head-hopping, keeping the narrative centered on Elara’s witnessing role. Diction is largely well-matched to the slightly mythic tone, though a few phrases (“intersubjective understanding,” “sacred geometry”) momentarily skew academic or abstract. Overall, the rhythmic control and sensory-focused phrasing carry the piece smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)

Rhythm varies nicely between long, meditative sentences and shorter emphatic ones, especially around key realizations and the act of restoring the crystal. There are a few slightly slogan-like phrasings (“His testimony would be restoration, not proclamation”) but they don’t break POV control or tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically charged, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with repeated metaphoric fields (tides, echoes, grain, fog) giving it a distinct signature.

POV boundaries are clean; we never slip outside Elara’s consciousness, and the narration’s elevated diction feels like her interior mode rather than an imposed essay voice. Rhythm varies nicely between long, meditative sentences and shorter, decisive ones around key turns.

POV distance is stable, blending external observation with filtered interiority without leakage or head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax modulate well around key beats, slowing into reverie and tightening around the egg’s cracking and the bird’s brief flight.

Diction balances lyricism with clarity, and the speculative terms (“synaptic plasticity,” “liquid starlight”) are integrated without breaking coherence. Psychic distance stays consistent; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the voice edges into generalized, essay-like phrasing, but not enough to destabilize POV.

    The narrative voice is confident and lyrical, with a distinct texture (“nectar dusk,” “cathedral of sky and science”) that feels unified with Kael’s contemplative perspective. POV distance is stable, and we never slip into knowledge Kael couldn’t plausibly have; Aris’s dialogue is clean and functional, if a bit elevated, which suits the quasi-mythic tone.

Diction (“incisively kind precision,” “mnemonic catalyst,” “conceptual repricing” echoes) stays mostly coherent with a quasi-omniscient, elevated register rather than character-bound colloquialism. Rhythm and sentence shape vary enough to avoid monotony, and the patterned “revelation” language teaches its structure clearly. Some phrases push toward abstract, essayistic register, slightly diluting the sense that this is Kael’s filtered experience rather than an authorial essay in costume.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a rigorous, reflective mathematician—technical language (calculus, topology, limits) sits naturally beside sensory and emotional texture. The narrative stance is stable and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices proofs, texture, and pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and well-matched to a historically oriented guide, with strong metaphors like “rosewater dread” and “protective hymn” giving the piece tonal cohesion. POV control is clean; we stay in Elara’s perception except for brief, plausible interiority from Hemlock delivered through action and dialogue. Diction is elevated but believable for a cultured narrator and avoids academic or corporate drift. The main limit on a higher score is that the lyricism stays in a fairly uniform key; sharper modulation of rhythm and texture under peak emotional beats could deepen impact.

    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a strong gothic-horror texture that meshes with the setting and concept. Diction (“repulsive allure,” “photographically cursed,” “lingering luminance”) feels curated and distinctive rather than generic, and the narrator’s way of noticing (coins, rust, velvet, dust motes) reads character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying clear goals and subtext in the exchange with the fear-thing.

    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, ritualistic material. Diction (“restless euphony,” “starlit threads,” “bruised-purple wall”) creates a distinct perceptual signature without major register slips. Rhythm modulates appropriately from incantatory build during the ritual to calmer, spacious lines at the denouement. A few repeated constructions (“fractal generating”) feel more mechanical than organic to the voice, but they don’t significantly undercut control.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly colored by Elara’s pattern-oriented worldview; phrases like “syntactic verb in the gate’s silent sentence” feel character-true rather than generic. Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely between dense description and sharper, shorter beats around key actions (“She drew a breath and played.”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated diction suits the mythic, contemplative tone. A trace of conceptual abstraction (“geometry of her presence”) slightly distances us from her body in peak moments, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice fits a reflective historian: elevated but not inaccessible, with controlled syntax and a measured, almost ceremonial cadence. The diction (e.g., "conceptual repricing" style abstractions) occasionally brushes the academic, yet it aligns with character and never breaks POV plausibility. Rhythm and distance are well handled, modulating from atmospheric description to aphoristic reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)

Diction like “interlaced absence,” “hushed blaze,” and “threading words into wounds” coheres tonally and feels intentional, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s meticulous, observational mindset, with a distinct rhythm and diction that suit the meditative investigative mode. Metaphors and elevated language (“dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness,” “forgotten syllables”) are coherent within the chosen register, and POV boundaries are respected—no head-hopping or unearned knowledge. At times the voice risks homogeneity of tone, with successive sentences leaning heavily on similar lush constructions, but it remains legible and purposeful. Under pressure (the discovery and stamping), the voice modulates just enough to mark importance without breaking its established cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and confident in its diction, with a recognizable rhythmic pattern that suits the contemplative mode. POV boundaries are clean and there’s no illicit knowledge beyond what Elara could plausibly perceive or infer.

Nonetheless, distance and stance are well controlled through the story’s emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, blending scientific and mystical registers in a way that feels true to this character. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating between tight, sensory observation and more sweeping, conceptual lines as her perception widens. There’s no POV slippage or helpful-narrator over-explaining beyond what her reflective, theory-inflected mind would plausibly articulate. A slight tendency toward elevated abstraction at peak moments prevents it from feeling utterly effortless, but it remains strong and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is a controlled, mildly elevated close third that stays consistent and plausible for a reflective, technically adept protagonist. Kael’s perception focuses on navigation, alignment, and machinery, while Elara’s dialogue and reactions skew toward wonder and reverence, giving them distinct textures even within a shared lyrical register. The cadence varies nicely between long, descriptive sentences and shorter, weighted beats at key turns (“Convergence achieved.” “Then, with deliberate strength, he began to pull.”). The lyricism occasionally brushes purple, but not enough to break POV coherence or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to a reflective, guilt-driven piece, with consistent access to Elias’s perceptions and values. Diction and rhythm show control (“tempered regret, cool and sharp as the cobalt tiles”) and maintain a coherent sensibility throughout. There are moments where the narration edges into omniscient/authorial abstraction (e.g., “a filtered silence where essential truth could finally be heard”) that feel less like his lived texture and more like thematic labeling. Still, the perceptual signature—ritualized, symbol-attentive, and somber—remains distinct and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated but controlled diction that fits a reflective, principled negotiator in a high-stakes ritual. Rhythm and syntax are varied, and the prose sustains a contemplative, ceremonial cadence that matches the piece’s aims.

Overall, though, focalization remains stable and confident, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lightly lyrical register that matches a seasoned seafarer’s reflective mood. Diction (“Blackrock Shoal,” “astronomical compass,” “Widow’s Point”) feels precise but not showy, and the narrative distance tightens effectively at emotional peaks. Recurrent phrasing from the brief (e.g., “flickering faith,” “backlash of regrets”) occasionally reads a touch engineered, but cadence and interior focalization remain coherent. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the modulation from numbness to tentative warmth is convincingly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a cool, precise diction that fits both Kael’s clinical background and the quasi-mystical journey. Phrases like "delicately robust" and "jaded wonder" show a clear tonal signature without feeling random, and the narrative distance stays steady and controlled. There is minor register elevation at times, but it aligns with the piece’s literary ambitions and Kael’s stylized consciousness rather than reading as intrusion.

    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently tuned to Elara’s sensibility, with consistent cosmic and natural metaphors. Diction and syntax are controlled and cohesive, and the psychic distance remains steady, allowing us to inhabit her perceptions without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with a clear mythic-fable register that suits the material. The brief zoom to Mano’s perspective is a controlled, purposeful slip rather than sloppy head-hopping, and it cleanly delivers the prophecy frame. Syntax and rhythm vary well enough to avoid monotony, and the diction largely aligns with the elevated tone. At times the register verges on uniformly lofty abstraction, which slightly flattens the perceptual signature and could benefit from a few more idiosyncratic or grounded turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but consistent, with a distinct texture built from geometric, light/shadow, and silence imagery that suits Kael’s role and mindset. There is no head-hopping, and focalization remains stable; the slight remove fits the deliberate, clandestine mood. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the prose modulates well from descriptive reverie to more precise mechanical action when Kael manipulates the sundial and hidden panel. The elevated diction feels intentional for a high-fantasy literary register and rarely drifts into incongruous abstraction.

Diction (“stormlit observatory,” “rarefied air,” “cartography of scars”) builds a distinct texture and does not drift in register or POV knowledge.

Some phrasing feels repetitively branded (e.g., recurrent “storm-kissed wonder,” “rarefy”), which slightly flattens the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, elevated lyric texture that matches Elara’s philosophical mindset. Lexicon and syntax are controlled and consistent, and the mechanical/technical notes (gyroscope, micron precision) are woven smoothly into an otherwise poetic register.

Still, there is no POV leakage or structural confusion, and the voice maintains coherence under the slight uptick in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual texture that blends urban grit and quasi-mystical imagery. Elara’s way of noticing (rusted beams as ribs, lemon cleaner vs. despair, “vagrant penny poet”) feels character-true rather than generic-poetic. Dialogue is spare but natural, and Kael’s speech has a slightly different idiom—more structural and metaphorically grounded in light and fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled lexicon that fits a “reality checker” in a mystical world—observant, sensory, yet open to wonder. Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately between higher-pressure beats (the silence after planting, the eruption of memory) and calmer reflective passages. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrator’s certainty tracks what Elara can plausibly infer. A few abstract formulations in the final paragraphs slightly mute the otherwise distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to a contemplative, magical-realist piece centered on a bonsai tutor and a memory-compass. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrase-work (“rhythmically placid,” color imagery, tide metaphors) forming a deliberate pattern rather than random ornament. Psychic distance stays consistent, never slipping into authorial explanation outside what this meditative character could plausibly frame. There is some tonal uniformity—nearly everything is rendered with the same hushed reverence—but it serves the chosen mode and remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is marred by unmotivated tense shifts, swinging from past ("stood") to present ("Aris preprocesses reality") and back within the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and artificial, prioritizing poetic cadence over narrative immediacy. The filter is thick with authorial interpretation, creating distance between the reader and the character's sensory experience.

    The voice aims for a poetic register but frequently stumbles into melodrama and clutter ("profoundly silently expressive grace"). While the tone is consistent, the narrative distance prevents visceral engagement with the trauma, keeping the reader at a safe, observant remove.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, matching the underwater atmosphere ("mausoleum of muted echoes") without breaking register. Narrative distance is stable, efficiently managing the shift from the physical mechanical crab to the metaphysical restoration of the books.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a sentimental, elevated register ("reverent hands," "infinite tenderness") that distances the reader from the reality of survival. The tone feels performative rather than grounded in the character’s immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, diagnosing the character's state ("spiritually curious mind") instead of demonstrating it. The tone leans into high lyricism that occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over immediate physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a distinct, elevated register suitable for the magical realist genre. However, the tone often drifts into purple prose ("sensory tide," "luminous threads") that distances the reader from the protagonist's grounded reality. The POV remains stable, focusing on Elara, but the high-flown diction occasionally obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and breathless, leaning on purple phrasing ("ecosystems on the brink of silence," "sacred tether"). While the tone aims for mythic, it often slides into melodrama that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice is heavily stylized and often slides into "purple" description ("silence woven from drowned memories") that distances the reader. The synesthesia provides a unique filter, but the prose frequently prioritizes poetic effect over immediate character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on adjectives and telling ("Elara was quietly savvy"). The tone struggles to balance the magical realism with the character's alleged savviness, resulting in a filter that feels more like a fairy tale summary than a thief's sharp perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly precious, prioritizing poetic posturing ("quiet rebellion," "captured dawn") over narrative drive or naturalistic observation. The narrative distance collapses into explanatory summary at key moments, telling the reader what to feel rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and heavy with adjectives ("feverish betrayal," "scorching her veins"), creating a melodramatic distance. The phrasing often feels artificial, drawing attention to the writing rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a breathless, over-poetic register that distances the reader. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("She discerned," "She believed," "She remembered") that filters immediate experience through analysis. The tone is cohesive but monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, polished tone suitable for a sentient machine, blending technical terms (“chronometer,” “chassis”) with poetic observation. However, the shift into high-concept philosophical abstraction at the end feels slightly abrupt and over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and detached, prioritizing poetic sentiment over character-specific perception. The tone remains reverent throughout, lacking the modulation required for dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, suiting the fable-like tone, though it occasionally slips into abstraction. Dialogue leans toward aphorism ("You measure chance. I measure care") rather than natural, goal-oriented speech.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct but marred by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("mechanically warm," "subdued awakening," "hush of beating wings"). These repetitions read as checklist insertions rather than organic voice, breaking the immersive spell and flattening the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the forced, four-fold repetition of the phrase "lately inspired," which reads as a prompt artifact rather than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is elevated and consistent but feels stylized and "writerly" rather than character-specific. The reliance on poetic abstraction ("limbs leaden," "swallowed truth") distances the reader from Elara's immediate experience. The prose texture often overtakes the character's distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a serious, investigative tone. The shift from skepticism to reverence is handled well within the POV, though the vocabulary occasionally drifts into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and meditative, fitting the story's mood, though it maintains a high level of psychic distance. The tone is cohesive, but reliance on lofty abstraction ("silent symphony," "healing force") occasionally drifts into "purple" territory.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, summarizing emotional states with diagnostic labels instead of trusting the dramatization. The forced insertion of prompt phrasing creates awkward syntactical breaks that disrupt the specific perceptual signature required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice aims for a meditative tone but is disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "His attribute of being sensitively perceptive"). These clumsily integrated elements break the narrative distance and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the fable-like structure. However, phrasing occasionally drifts into purple territory ("minor key of regret," "familiar enigma") that feels like forced integration of prompt terms rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, but the dialogue suffers from artificiality, with characters speaking in thesis statements. Kael and Elara sound like thematic vessels rather than distinct individuals under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a "precious" literary tone that creates distance rather than intimacy. The relentless lyricism ("time's ether," "phantom baton") flattens the emotional texture. The narration prioritizes poetic effect over immediate, grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and confident but leans heavily into a breathless, high-poetic register ("symphony of light," "metaphysical sliver"). While distinct, the register creates distance and occasionally clashes with the technical terminology of the prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is consistent but occasionally filters immediate experience through heavy interpretative layers ("silent confession of loss," "relic of the final melody") instead of raw sensory input. The voice leans into a sentimental register that sometimes distances the reader from the grit of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "meticulous recorder" persona. However, it occasionally stiffens into academic register ("corrosive compromises," "psychological probe") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, fitting the "wistful" persona. However, narrative distance occasionally collapses into sentimental assertion ("force of a physical touch") rather than remaining grounded in the character's immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and adjectival, distancing the reader from the immediate experience. The insertion of specific phrases ("passionate subtlety") feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm, making the narration feel constructed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, often filtering perception through poetic abstraction that feels author-imposed. The register ("exquisitely sensitive," "magnificent simplicity") sometimes drifts into label-speak disguised as lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the story's tone well. However, occasional reliance on slightly elevated, adjective-heavy diction ("kissed his skin," "bloomed profound empathy") creates a layer of distance that softens the impact of the raw emotion intended.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stiff, often summarizing emotional states rather than dramatizing them. The dialogue sounds like written prose ("Let us initiate a small rebellion"), lacking the naturalism and distinct idioms required to distinguish the two characters effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stiffly elevated, resulting in dialogue that sounds like written prose ("For fifty seasons, I have sought..."). The "emotional ventriloquism" asserts depth of feeling that hasn't been built on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately reverent, fitting the fable-like tone without slipping into melodrama. The narrative distance is controlled, prioritizing the visual and sensory details relevant to the protagonist's profession.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    The POV anchors in Elara but drifts into omniscient summarization of Evans' internal state ("recognition, grief, and dawning understanding") at the climax, diluting the protagonist's perspective. The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overly poetic ("fragile bridge across the sapphire hush").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "purple" descriptors ("emerald velvet," "whispered secret") that occasionally distance the reader. The tone is cohesive, though the shift to a didactic register in the dialogue flattens the character's distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by significant repetitive artifacts that erode immersion. The recurrence of specific phrasing across different characters and the narrator blurs the distinction between the protagonist’s perception and the author’s descriptor choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice adopts a distant, fable-like tone that summarizes interiority ("marvel of contradictions") rather than immersing the reader in the character's immediate sensory experience. The POV remains consistent, but the distance prevents a deep emotional connection to Elara's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, suiting the archivist persona. However, it leans toward elevated abstraction ("transform voids of loss") that creates a slight distance from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the fable-like tone, but often feels detached due to a reliance on high-register abstractions ("lithic signposts," "emergent cartography"). It maintains a distinct texture throughout but risks alienating the reader with its density and lack of intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, though it occasionally veers into abstraction ("symphony of pure resonance"). The narrative distance is controlled, but the insertion of prompt-specific phrases like "courageously kind" feels slightly repetitive and mechanical within the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and elevated diction that distances the reader ("ennui," "prismatic," "escondite"). A jarring register slip occurs with "compassionate delivery mechanism," which feels clinical and mechanical against the established high-fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a controlled, analytical tone that fits the forensic/ethical consultant persona. The shift from clinical observation to philosophical realization is handled smoothly, though the voice occasionally drifts into slightly purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from heavy filtering ("she noted," "she felt") and a tendency toward "writerly" intrusion over character experience. The elevated register drifts into abstraction, distancing the reader from the immediate sensory reality of the workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a distinct, melancholic filter appropriate for the character's "ghost" persona. However, the tone is uniformly reverent, lacking modulation; the "poetic" distance prevents the reader from feeling the visceral grit the protagonist claims to seek.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into sentimental clichés ("tears traced clean paths," "breath of the churning sea"). The tone lacks the "clinical precision" attributed to the protagonist, resulting in a generic emotive register.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and expository, frequently filtering experience through summaries of thought ("Kael knew," "felt fragile hope"). The tone feels fable-like and protective, preventing the reader from experiencing the raw uncertainty of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is functional but tends toward a generic "writerly" tone with elevated adjectives ("sacred interval," "impossible gold"). There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature; the narration tells the reader the significance of the moment rather than allowing the voice to convey it through observation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified, successfully maintaining the "gentle artisan" tone. However, it leans into melodramatic sentimentality ("vibration traveling through stone and soul," "sacred duty") which distances the reader from the gritty reality of the repair work.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("vast white silence," "profound truth") that distances the reader from immediate experience. The narrative distance is stable, yet the tone feels overly reverence-filled, lacking the "dry wit" promised in the character description. The brevity of the piece prevents head-hopping, but the voice lacks a distinct, pressure-tested perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice suffers from a "dungeon master" quality, frequently pausing the narrative flow to list character stats and mission parameters. While the lyrical tone is consistent, it often veers into melodrama ("tear of joy," "respectful shadows") and lacks the rhythmic variation needed to build genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into a melodramatic, high-fantasy register ("crimson pulse," "lonely metronome"). While functional, it lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic texture to distinguish it from standard genre prose.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornate ("whispered prayers," "bruised horizon"), creating a distance from the characters. The high register feels imposed by the author rather than arising from Kael’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly reliant on adjectival density ("profound hush", "spectral devotion"). The recurring insertion of required phrases creates a mechanical rhythm that disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly florid, prioritizing poetic posturing over clarity or distinct character perspective. The reliance on abstract nouns and adjective-heavy phrasing creates a distance that prevents intimate engagement with Elara's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but distant, utilizing an elevated, reverence-heavy register that filters the protagonist's experience through poetic interpretation. The narration often summarizes "learning" and "feeling" rather than immersing the reader in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly interpreting the meaning of events for the reader ("a profound juxtaposition," "a tactile testament"). This over-explanation distances the reader from the character's immediate experience and reduces the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive phrasing and a heavy reliance on telling over showing. The repeated use of "echoed silence" (three times) distracts from the tone and suggests a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, high-fantasy tone that suits the subject matter, though dialogue is often stiff and oracular. The shift into the memory vision is handled smoothly without breaking the established point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized, leaning into elevated, poetic diction ("lotus-hearted ache," "sanctuary woven") that creates distance from the character's immediate reality. The interiority often reads like a thematic thesis statement, prioritizing lyrical description over embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "workshop preciousness," relying on abstract noun phrases ("silenced era," "conscious surrender") that distance the reader. Narration occasionally slips into meta-commentary ("Her action was to display," "The core concept unfolded"), which breaks immersion and sounds like an essay explaining the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice often slips into "helpful narrator" mode, summarizing Elara's realizations ("Elara understood her role was not authority...") instead of trusting the action. While the lyrical tone fits the setting, the interiority is often diagnostic rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, alternating between lush description and awkward, repetitive phrasing inserted to meet prompt requirements. The repetition of the phrases "candidly cryptic" and "converging chaos" within such a short space breaks the narrative spell and draws attention to the artifice. The tone leans into purple prose ("voice was steady steel," "hanging like dew") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical but suffers from "purple prose" that distances the reader. The narrative stance is overly helpful, explaining the meaning of every image ("perfect metaphor for a heart made whole") rather than trusting the reader to infer it. The tone is monotonic, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish moments of despair from joy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" description and sentimental phrasing. The narrative distance is static, preventing intimacy, and the tone feels more like a descriptive catalog than a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and relies heavily on telling emotional states ("breath of cautious exuberance"). The repetition of the specific phrase "cautious exuberance" three times (narration and dialogue) breaks immersion and reads as a forced prompt insertion rather than organic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is overly ornamental, prioritizing complex metaphors over character-specific perception. The prose draws attention to the writer's word choices ("mechanical sonnet," "sacred tightrope") rather than the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, reflective, and suitably elevated for a character obsessed with maps and memory. It occasionally leans into density ("swirling constellations," "fragile bloom"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct to Elias. The shift in focus from the meteorite to the ledger tracks his internal change well.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from significant repetitive artifacts ("featherly determined" appears three times; "fractured hush" appears four times). This mechanical repetition of prompt phrases creates a stilted rhythm that disrupts the otherwise polished tone.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but heavily reliant on purple prose and "writerly" constructions. The forced repetition of complex phrases ("luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder") creates an artificial, checklist-driven rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and matches the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought poeticisms ("star’s violent kiss") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple, "writerly" phrasing ("star-dusted wilderness," "indifferent clarity") that distances the reader. The tone effectively matches the protagonist's analytical nature but occasionally drifts into intrusive interpretation of the events.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic register but suffers from a lack of modulation; the relentless density of metaphor creates a distancing effect. The tone feels performative rather than intimate, holding the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, meditative register but suffers from heavy-handedness. The dense use of adjectives ("pearlescent," "noctilucent," "ethereal") creates a texture that feels overly curated and occasionally stiff. While the POV is stable, the lack of distinct perceptual limitations makes the narration feel like an authorial lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is consistent but overly wrought, relying on "purple" phrasing ("scars... whispering," "enlightenment bloomed") that distances the reader. The tone leans into melodrama, and the POV filters reality through abstract concepts instead of sensory immediacy. The result is a "poetic" affectation rather than a grounded character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distant, creating a barrier to emotional engagement. The brief head-hop into Kael’s dream is managed but feels convenient and summary-like rather than structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, alternating between poetic imagery and clunky, repetitive labels ("sensitively perceptive nature," "film negative strip"). The mechanical repetition of these specific phrases disrupts the immersive quality and gives the narration a robotic, checklist-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and ornate, prioritizing poetic description over character-specific interiority. The repetition of the prompt phrase "perceptively calm" as a filter creates a mechanical feel. The tone is consistent but lacks the distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("tremor in his soul," "kissed the horizon"). Dialogue is stagey and declarative ("Wood and moonlight won't refill our wells"), reading more like a script than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching Silas's self-perception as an architect of his world. However, the filter is occasionally intrusive ("He believed," "He felt"), and the tone slips into melodrama ("titan erased") that feels slightly detached from the grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyrical tone suitable for the fable-like content. However, the mechanical repetition of the specific phrase "bodily poetic" (three times) disrupts the psychic distance and feels like an unintegrated constraint rather than a natural part of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is competent but overly expository, frequently summarizing motivation ("His motivation—to explore...") and meaning rather than dramatizing them. The narrative distance is too close, interpreting the character's thoughts for the reader instead of allowing access to the raw sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an over-reliance on adjective-noun pairings and elevated diction ("profound intimacy," "infinite tenderness") that tells the reader the emotional weight instead of evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its solemn, lyric tone. However, the verbatim repetition of the awkward phrase "technically gentle" (three times) disrupts the flow and feels like a mechanical insertion rather than an organic character trait. The voice prioritizes poetic density over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice aims for poetic gravity but frequently lands on overwrought descriptors ("crystalline sigh," "singular fracture") that create distance. The tone remains high-handed and interpretive throughout, telling the reader how to feel about the events.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the setting, but it maintains too much psychic distance, summarizing Enlil's emotional state rather than inhabiting it. The reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns keeps the reader from experiencing the moment of connection viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overwritten, relying on abstract, elevated phrasing ("profound pressure of presence," "corrosive grip") that creates distance rather than intimacy. The POV filters the experience through a lens of therapeutic jargon rather than lived sensory experience, flattening the characters into archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice suffers from "blueprint bleed," explicitly stating narrative functions ("Her motivation burned...", "Her action was to recreate...", "This fragile hour enabled her core concept"). This creates distance, reading more like a synopsis than an immersed POV. The tone is consistent but overly explanatory, telling the reader what to feel about the ritual rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but veers into purple prose ("breathtaking collision," "poignant gifts"). Dialogue suffers significantly from lack of naturalism, functioning as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than authentic character speech, particularly in the use of the "feisty" tag.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" descriptors ("otherworldly radiance," "luminous understanding," "sacred trust"). While the shift to the quirky bathroom ritual adds a welcome distinctness, the surrounding prose often adopts a generic high-fantasy register that distances the reader from Elara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but suffers from an overwrought "high fantasy" tone that creates distance. The rhythm is monotonous, often relying on similar sentence structures to deliver abstract imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a melancholic, lyrical tone suitable for the genre. However, the register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("time’s tide," "cathedral of her acceptance"), which distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, slightly elevated register that fits the archivist persona. Narrative distance is stable, though somewhat remote, prioritizing observation over visceral interiority. The prose effectively establishes the magical realism tone, even if it lacks distinct rhythmic variation during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The high-fantasy voice is consistent and atmospheric, suited to the "harmonic" subject matter. However, the lexical choices occasionally drift into "purple" territory, prioritizing sound over clarity, and the narrative distance prevents visceral intimacy with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the mythic/hopeful tone, maintaining a stable POV. However, the register occasionally drifts into melodrama ("sacred dialogue," "symphony of light") that distances the reader from immediate experience. The control is solid, but the effect is somewhat anesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a high-fantasy literary tone, fitting the archivist persona. However, it suffers from a lack of modulation, maintaining a breathless elevation throughout that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and successfully filters the world through Elara's technical expertise, giving the narrative a distinct texture. However, the high lyrical register occasionally creates distance, prioritizing poetic effect over immediate grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is overly "helpful," interpreting the significance of every moment for the reader. The verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "warmly observant" as a narrator tag ("Elara’s warmly observant nature," "Warmly observant empathy") breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a distancing, explanatory filter ("She understood the hush’s attribute"). The tone borders on melodramatic ("symphony of infinite space"), creating a barrier to intimacy. The POV observes the character's realization from a slightly removed, analytical distance rather than inhabiting the raw sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining motivations and emotional shifts ("Elara’s motivation was not merely..."). The tone is consistent but overly sentimental, lacking the restraint or distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently elevated but relies on abstract labels ("wisely adventurous," "futuristic nostalgia") to define the tone. These insertions feel like prompt-checks rather than organic components of the narrator's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive, frequently explaining the meaning of actions as they occur. The tone is instructional and melodramatic, which distances the reader from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overwrought, poetic register that distances the reader. Dialogue feels unnatural and stagey ("Will it anchor you in fear..."), serving as thematic exposition rather than authentic character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a high literary register, though it frequently leans into heavy adjectival modification ("eloquently silent," "fossilized echo"). The tone matches the setting but feels somewhat performative, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone, fitting the genre but creating psychic distance from the protagonist. Occasional phrasing choices like "factually mystical" break the immersion, reading as clunky or expository rather than integrated into the POV’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified, maintaining a reverent, contemplative tone throughout. However, the register frequently drifts into sentimental "therapy-speak" ("archival love," "vessel of connection") which distances the reader from the raw experience. The POV is stable, but the filtering of every event through an interpretive lens softens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, "purple" phrasing ("vast tapestry," "surrendered to shadow"). The POV distance slips into omniscient judgment to praise the protagonist ("The underestimated archivist..."), distancing the reader from her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, frequently labeling emotions and concepts ("steeped in eerie nostalgia") instead of evoking them through specific detail or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from excessive sentimentality and repetitive phrasing. The tone leans heavily into "cozy" abstraction, which distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, though it leans toward the melodramatic and sentimental ("ache of things out of sync"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone sometimes drifts into explanatory lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive diction and forced phrasing (e.g., "factually mystical"). The reliance on high-fantasy register often slips into purple prose that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a steady "luminous" tone. While effective, it occasionally teeters into purple prose ("bled softly," "hummed with latent memory") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The detached, clinical voice aligns with the "mathematics" concept but creates an emotional barrier. The recurring grammatical error ("he brace") significantly undermines the narrator's authority and breaks the immersive spell of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a reverent tone. However, it often slips into "purple" styling ("boots whispered," "silent sentinels") that distances the reader. The narrative distance is stable, but the register feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from clunky, meta-fictional phrasing that breaks immersion, most notably the line "His attribute of being skillfully observant immediately engaged," which reads like game mechanics. The POV is consistent but filtered through an excess of explanatory adjectives that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a breathless, elevated register that creates distance ("nascent awareness," "soft susurrus"). The tone prioritizes atmospheric reverence over immediate sensory experience, leading to a "told" rather than "lived" quality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    The elevated, formal voice is consistent and suits the baroque aesthetic ("silent splendor," "luminous stillness"). However, the register occasionally creates distance, prioritizing aesthetic description over immediate, grounded character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly "helpful," frequently pausing to explain the philosophy or the meaning of metaphors ("verdigris luminescence—the beautiful green..."). The tone leans into melodrama ("sacred vow," "high priest") which distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitably elevated register for the subject matter. However, it occasionally lapses into telling over showing ("Thorne’s panic," "sensibly eccentric"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but distanced by a reliance on elevated, slightly "purple" phrasing ("staticky sigh," "quiet engine of her spirit"). The narration often explains emotions ("not sorrow, but connection") rather than allowing them to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the significance of symbols and grandmother's intent. The tone is overly reverent and adjectival, creating a distance that feels interpretive rather than immersive. Narrative certainty ("Elara knew she would carry this tenderness") feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a "solemn archivist" tone throughout. The shift between the library frame and the gritty flashback is handled smoothly without head-hopping. The narrative distance is appropriate for the fable-like quality of the tale.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like tone. It effectively manages the shift from melancholic reflection to purposeful action, though it occasionally relies on elevated diction that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "venerable scribe" persona well. However, it occasionally leans into unearned solemnity or poetic abstraction that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, relying on abstract nouns and adjective-heavy constructions that create distance. The use of "furiously tranquil" as a direct label twice disrupts the narrative immersion and reads as a forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable "legendary" tone, but it often summarizes emotion ("deepest motivation," "steadfast resolve") rather than inhabiting it. This creates a psychic distance that keeps the reader observing Elara rather than feeling with her.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive, functioning as an interpreter that explains the protagonist's feelings ("This act was not observation but communion") rather than letting the reader infer them. This "helpful narrator" syndrome creates psychic distance, keeping the reader at arm's length from the raw experience of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and interpretive, telling the reader exactly what symbols mean ("meant to symbolize enduring sweetness"). The register slips noticeably with the phrase "contextual clues," which feels clinical and jarring against the mythic/poetic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    The perspective shift to Elara in the final paragraph occurs without a section break, reading as a head-hop that dilutes Kael's closure. While the voice is consistent, the structural handling of the transition weakens the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice frequently intrudes with essayistic commentary (&quot;The timeframe was crystalline...&quot;) that breaks immersion. The consistent elevated register feels performative, prioritizing poetic cadence over authentic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, fitting the fable-like mode. However, the narrator frequently over-explains the protagonist's internal state and the story's meaning, reducing the power of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a coherent academic-lyrical tone, but the dialogue feels stiff and expository ("You speak of unity..."). The narrative distance is stable, though it often filters experience through explanatory labels rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and distinctively flowery ("intoned," "surrendered"), creating a distance that prevents visceral engagement with the protagonist's task.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and filtered, creating distance with phrases like "symphony of absence." The narrative tends to summarize the significance of emotions ("cadence of her laugh") rather than embodying the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward an explanatory, elevated register ("steeped in an echoed silence," "resonant possibility") that creates distance. The prose occasionally over-interprets the character's experience for the reader instead of letting the sensory details carry the emotional weight. Control is evident, but the tone feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated tone but relies heavily on "telling" over "showing." The narration frequently interrupts the scene to explain the meaning of objects and actions ("Kael's attribute was sacredly playful reverence") instead of allowing the imagery to convey these concepts implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric register but creates distance through heavy abstraction ("unvarnished truth," "vanished ordinary"). While the tone matches the "luminous absence" prompt, the constant elevation flattens emotional dynamics, treating every moment with the same level of reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like quality of the piece. The POV remains firmly with Elara, filtering the world through her specific burden of memory. While competent, the voice sometimes drifts into melodramatic abstraction ("exquisite pain," "irrevocably shifted") rather than grounding the experience in fresher, more specific perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains an elevated, fable-like tone appropriate for the genre. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwriting ("gilded cage of silence," "symphony, warm and unbroken") that creates a distancing effect. The focus on chess metaphors is disciplined, though at times it feels like a filter applied too thickly over the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative head-hops from Elara to Borin ("He saw her...") mid-scene without transition, breaking the focalization. The voice struggles with the forced insertion of required phrases, disrupting the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("topography of endurance") and abstract similes ("chipped like his resolve"). The dialogue is stagey, reading more like a prepared speech than the words of a dying man.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but creates distance through unremittingly elevated register and melodrama ("sound of a world ending"). The prose prioritizes poetic posturing over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, blending a rough maritime setting with the flowery diction of a romance novel ("nascent sun," "weaved through salt spray"). Dialogue is staged and unnatural, serving as an exposition delivery system for the theme rather than reflecting the distinct idiom of lighthouse keepers.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently interpreting the narrative for the reader. The tone suffers from "purple" tendencies, prioritizing elaborate metaphors over emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it occasionally lapses into "expository interiority" that summarizes emotions instead of embodying them. The focus on explaining the ritual's logic distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reverent tone that suits the subject matter. However, the register occasionally drifts into the precious ("sacred space," "tapestry of shared humanity"), which distances the reader from the raw reality of the isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is stable and atmospheric but marred by the clumsy, repetitive insertion of the prompt phrase "empirically intuitive." The tone occasionally drifts into sentimental abstraction ("light that felt like forgiveness") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy register with distinct lyrical texture. However, the integration of required traits is occasionally meta-textual ("Her inherent attribute..."), disrupting the immersive distance of the point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," interpreting the emotional weight of every moment ("a silent language older than words") rather than letting the action speak. The tone leans into high-fantasy abstraction that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on adjectival explanation ("profoundly chronologically confused," "ethereal form"). The narrative frequently directs the reader on how to interpret the character's feelings rather than trusting the action to evoke them.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a lack of psychic distance control, frequently explaining the character's realizations to the reader. The tone leans into sentimentality, and the dialogue feels stiff and purposeful rather than naturalistic. The reliance on filter verbs ("Elara felt," "She realized") creates a barrier between the reader and the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the character's emotional state instead of trusting the action. The use of filter verbs and interpretive phrasing ("she understood... as a compassionate teacher") acts as a barrier, explaining the epiphany rather than allowing the reader to feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("resurrected prayer," "cathedral of suspended breath"). The stylized tone fits the genre but feels slightly performative, prioritizing aesthetic over raw authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, maintaining a steady, elevated tone. However, the requisite phrase "wanderingly exact" (lines 8, 18) feels slightly shoehorned, creating a brief hitch in the otherwise smooth narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, meditative, and appropriately weighted for the fable-like quality of the story. The control of narrative distance during the countdown is excellent, zooming in on the droplet and the sun. The reprise of "eminently peculiar" feels slightly mechanical, but the overall texture is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic ("sacred passage," "embodiment of familiar strangers"). Dialogue is the primary weak point, sounding like written thesis statements or therapy-speak rather than natural human speech, stripping the interaction of authentic intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, interpreting every image for the reader ("teaching that clarity requires diffusion"). While the tone is consistent, the lack of distance control turns the character's experience into a guided lesson rather than an immersed reality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized; dialogue reads as poetic monologue rather than natural speech ("Honor its rotation"), which reduces verisimilitude even within a fable frame.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts an overly elevated, essayistic register ("confluence of wind, water, and will") that creates distance. The use of philosophical jargon ("proximate causes," "original covenant") clashes with the intimate emotional content, making the POV feel constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.9)
    The point of view is disrupted by intrusive meta-commentary ("This was the precise timeframe when the story changed") that breaks immersion. The narrative voice is overly interpretive, explaining the significance of events ("abstraction crystallized into shared humanity") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical tone but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the metaphors as they happen ("aligning not with magnetic north but with emotional truth"). This explanatory distance prevents immersion. The tone is elevated but occasionally stumbles into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and suitably lyrical for the setting, but it suffers from the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("contingent relationships," "strange comfort"). These repetitions break the narrative trance, making the narrator sound mechanical and overly beholden to a checklist rather than an organic consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative voice is overly ornate, often filtering immediate experience through "writing" (e.g., "symphony of gesture"). Dialogue is the primary failure point; the seven-year-old's speech ("Grandfather says silence is a canvas") is indistinguishable from the narrator's poetic register, shattering verisimilitude and distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from heavy interpretive filtering, constantly explaining the emotional significance of objects ("a metaphor for mending"). This distance prevents a visceral connection to Kael’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls a high, lyrical register well ("cosmic breath," "captured dawn"). However, this elevated tone remains uniform throughout, creating a layer of insulation between the reader and the visceral reality of the trauma. The voice prioritizes poetic cadence over the grit of the character's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice suffers from an overly elevated, explanatory register that distances the reader from the grit of the setting. Phrases like "dawning confusion" and "syllables barely stirring the dust" feel written rather than lived. The dialogue is stiff and functional, serving primarily to articulate the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and self-consciously poetic ("vastening sky," "ministry complete"). This high register creates distance and feels performative, occasionally drifting into melodrama that undermines the quiet empathy the story attempts to portray.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains the requested "amplified quiet," but teeters into sentimentality. The tone feels overly precious ("symphony," "prophecy," "reverence") which distances the reader from the grit of actual human change.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently telling the reader what Elara feels ("making violence impossible for her soul") rather than evoking it. The tone is consistent but leans into melodrama, creating a barrier to genuine emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but tends toward an overly analytical and "tell-y" style, explaining the character's psychology instead of demonstrating it. The dramatic narration of the whittling is a strong voice element, but the surrounding prose is often heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register but relies heavily on explanatory telling to assert significance ("a silence so profound it felt sacred"). The narration often summarizes the character's internal state ("motivation... was fulfilled") instead of trusting the dramatization to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative head-hops mid-scene without section breaks, shifting from Elara’s interiority to Kael’s ("Kael watched... Awakening bloomed within him") and back. This unmotivated perspective drift diffuses tension and violates the single-POV or controlled multi-POV requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly poetic and adjectival ("soft as a struck bell," "voice threading the chimes"), creating a distance that feels performative. The high-lyric mode flattens the distinction between narration and dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a coherent tone. However, the register occasionally slips into melodrama ("fragile ember of subdued ardor") that feels more like prompt-insertion than natural character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the narrative voice is consistently atmospheric, the dialogue is indistinguishable from the prose, reading as stiff, grammatical speeches. There is no distinction in idiom between the "cartomancer" and the "former developer"; both speak in the same elevated, abstract register.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriate for the high-fantasy/parable tone. It leans towards the lyrical ("twilight bled violet," "quiet fire"), which supports the atmosphere but occasionally creates distance through elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and polished but maintains a fable-like distance that prevents intimacy with the character's dilemma. The tone leans toward the sentimental ("symphony of shared joy"), which flattens the potential for subtext and darker complexity in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is consistent but filtered through a heavy layer of interpretive authorial voice ("curled possessively," "heartbreakingly small"). The narration explains the character's feelings rather than allowing the reader to experience them directly.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and explanatory, prioritizing the telling of emotions over showing them. The lyrical tone occasionally drifts into pretension ("crystalline clarity," "verdant wave") without deepening the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly dependent on "poetic" abstraction ("symphony of sorrow," "emotional architecture") that distances the reader. The tone leans into sentimentality rather than grounded emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered ("she felt," "she saw"), creating unnecessary psychic distance during what should be intimate moments. The tone is relentlessly lofty and poetic, lacking the modulation or grit needed to make the "catharsis" feel grounded in human experience. The POV observes the emotion rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and adjective-heavy ("profound attribute," "delicate manipulation," "quiet certainty"). The blend of mythic language ("lullaby," "tapestry") with technical jargon ("wave functions," "quantum fabric") feels slightly jarring. The tone is cohesive but lacks the rhythmic variation needed to build genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, summarizing emotional states ("peace settled deep") rather than dramatizing them. The inclusion of the second-person pronoun "your" in the motivation phrase within a third-person text creates a jarring POV breach.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts an affected, high-literary register that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The filter of "long sorrow" and "whispered secrets" creates a barrier to intimacy, and the tone remains static throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the "high" tone of the fortress with the raw pain of the protagonist. The POV remains tightly controlled, filtering the world effectively through Elara's grief and physical rehabilitation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is elevated but distant, frequently slipping into summary; the sudden head-hop to Elara violates the established POV logic without a clear section break or setup. This shift fractures the reader's attachment to Kael at the critical moment. The tone is consistent but overly reverent, lacking the modulation needed to create tension.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("face smudged with salt and sorrow"). The distinction between the narrator and the "younger self" recording is negligible; both speak in the same thematic thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, creating a distance that muffles immediate sensory experience. The reliance on poetic abstraction ("margin of daylight," "ancient song") prioritizes style over the concrete grounding expected of the POV's mechanic background.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic but leans into distancing abstractions ("renewal's damp promise") that mute the immediacy. The transition from grim insurgent to nurturing healer is smooth, though the dialogue at the end feels didactic and stiff.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, blending flowery prose with sterile therapy jargon ("somatic markers"). The clumsy, repetitive insertion of the phrase "quietly talented" (three times) disrupts the narrative flow and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on "purple" descriptors ("liquid starlight," "luminescent ache") that distance the reader. The tone feels constructed to satisfy a prompt rather than arising organically from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("drink the starlight," "willing pilgrim") that distances the reader. The repetition of the phrase "serene anger" becomes a distracting tic, and the text relies on filtering ("Kael felt," "He observed") rather than direct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("scandalize the city's soul"). The tone matches the frozen setting well.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is overwrought and adjective-heavy ("fragile sanctuary," "crystalline blossom," "silent poem"), creating a distance between the reader and the experience. The repetition of specific phrases ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the high-fantasy tone. However, it occasionally slips into expository telling ("The garden possessed a profound attribute") and repetitively uses the prompt's specific vocabulary ("transliterate") in a way that feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is appropriately precise and formal. However, the recurring insertion of specific prompt phrases disrupts the naturalism of the character's interiority, creating a stilted rhythm in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The close-third POV is stable, focusing effectively on Elara's internal state during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "healing fantasy" mode, though it occasionally filters experience through diagnostic narration. Narrative distance is stable, but the prose textures feel somewhat uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, constantly explaining the significance of actions ("This act was aberrant mercy incarnate") instead of allowing them to land. The tone is consistently elevated and abstract, creating distance from the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and "emotional ventriloquism," telling the reader what to feel (e.g., "profound, peaceful acceptance"). Dialogue feels artificial and stagey ("The encore was never in the applause"), matching the prompt's archetypes but lacking naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies on an elevated, slightly adjectival register ("visceral reminder," "luminous intention") that distances the reader. The tone matches the mystical subject matter but occasionally drifts into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, reverent, and atmospheric, suiting the meditative pace. However, it occasionally slips into overwrought sentimentality ("voice of the unknown," "impossible grace") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical, mythic tone but suffers from overwriting and interpretive distancing. The narrator frequently explains the significance of actions ("a quiet covenant with memory") instead of letting the actions speak. This creates a "perfomative" quality that prioritizes sounding profound over narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and repetitive, relying on a small loop of "poetic" terms. The tone feels performative, prioritizing the sound of the words over the authenticity of the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice slips into an academic, latinate register ("ambient awareness," "coherence," "mnemonic") that clashes with the established occupation and setting. This register drift creates an authorial intrusion that distances the reader from Silas’s grounded reality. The perspective is consistent but lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like piece, maintaining a steady, elevated tone. However, the reliance on explanatory filters ("He knew," "He understood") creates a distance that prevents deep immersion in the character’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from a lack of distance control, often drifting into sentimental filtering ("sigh only Elara could feel"). The mechanical repetition of specific phrases (likely prompt requirements) disrupts the immersive quality of the voice, making it feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and elevated but suffers from distancing filter verbs ("She now knew," "She witnessed," "She felt"). The tone struggles to integrate the required sci-fi element ("atomically reflective") into the high-fantasy register, causing a momentary breach in immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on elevated, poetic abstraction ("curling cipher," "luminous web") that creates distance from the character's immediate experience. The tone remains reverent throughout, missing opportunities to modulate based on the physical exertion of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and maintains the "ethereal grit" tone, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("silent scream," "jagged scar of malice"). The narrative distance is appropriate, keeping the focus tight on Aris’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and reasonably controlled, fitting the fantasy tone. However, the integration of required phrases is sometimes clunky ("prudently adventurous rhythm"), disrupting the narrative flow. The prose leans toward the melodramatic ("vibrating in her very marrow"), which distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, with a somber, slightly elevated register. It occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("defiance against oblivion"), but maintains a cohesive narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice leans heavily on melodrama and telling ("spongey dread," "fragile certainty"). The perspective remains close to Elara but filters the world through heavy-handed adjectives and summarized interiority rather than immediate sensory perception or distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is distancing and overly explanatory, relying heavily on filter verbs ("He understood," "He knew") and meta-commentary on the tone ("the tone of the moment was sacred revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dialogue lacks naturalism, relying on elevated, written-sounding phrases ("We built meaning for a season," "modern talisman") that break immersion. The voice struggles to distinguish between narration and speech.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the contemplative tone ("sanctuary of midnight solace"). However, it relies frequently on filter verbs ("she witnessed," "she knew") and abstract emotional summaries, which creates distance from the immediate physical experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice creates distance through constant filtering and elevated, flowery diction that summarizes emotional states ("serenity," "shame") instead of embodying them. The tone feels performative rather than authentic to the character’s experience.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is hampered by the mechanical repetition of required phrases ("purposefully curious" appears four times; "anxious elation" four times), which breaks immersion. The tone struggles to balance the high-fantasy register with these inserted labels, resulting in a breathless, adjective-laden delivery that feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is overwritten and consistently disrupts immersion with clunky, repetitive phrasing ("fiercely gentle," "dusky"). The prose draws attention to its own construction and adherence to constraints rather than the character’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("shroud," "sentinel," "repository of ghosts"). While the specialized vocabulary of the roadie/appraiser adds authority, the emotional register is often overwrought, telling the reader how to feel rather than evoking the feeling through restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, blending scientific observation with scholarly reverence, fitting the character well. However, the narration occasionally slips into interpretative summary ("betraying the haunted ambition") rather than letting action speak. The shift from clinical observation to emotional epiphany is handled smoothly within the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and maintains the intended "wintersun serenity," though it suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome" by explaining the magic mechanics. The poetic register is competent but occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a lofty, fable-like register that creates distance. While appropriate for the genre, it lacks a distinct, textured perceptual signature, relying instead on elevated vocabulary that sometimes obscures the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the awkward, repetitive insertion of the required phrase "daringly methodical." The tone is appropriately lyrical but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic and elevated tone suitable for the genre. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("gossamer veil," "latent syllables") and lacks a distinct, gritty perceptual signature that would ground the high concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" description ("linen like truth," "liquid light"). While the tone matches the magical realism elements, the density of adjectival phrases occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from mechanical exposition, particularly in lines like "Her motivation was..." and "Her method was..." which flatten the psychic distance. These structures read like prompt responses inserted into the text rather than organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, elevated tone but slips into overwrought sentimentality and cliché ("gleaming like a captured tear of joy"). The narrative distance is too close to the author's thematic agenda, preventing the character's unique perspective from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly formal and abstract ("solemn vocation," "calcified his spirit"). Dialogue sounds like written prose or a thesis statement rather than natural speech, creating a distance that prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent, meditative, and appropriate for the academic protagonist. Narrative distance is controlled, with smooth transitions between the physical setting and internal memory.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fantasy tone that suits the mythic subject matter ("First Builder," "Pulse"). However, the register occasionally drifts into breathless abstraction, and the distance remains somewhat remote, observing Corbin rather than deeply inhabiting his immediate physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable-like tone. However, the reliance on slightly elevated, poetic phrasing ("silent ballet," "humming looms") occasionally distances the reader from the visceral reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice frequently breaks immersion with meta-commentary that sounds like stage directions or outline notes (e.g., "The setting transformed with the timeframe," "answering his quest"). This "scaffolding" voice flattens the emotional experience and prevents the third-person perspective from feeling lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the cosmic scale, maintaining a meditative tone. However, it leans into "sci-fi lyrical" abstractions without a distinct personal texture or grain for Elara herself. The distance remains somewhat remote, observing her thoughts rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a high-fantasy register that fits the setting. However, the narration is often distant and explanatory ("His intended action was sacred transformation"), telling the reader the significance of events rather than showing it. This tendency creates a barrier to immediate emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a solemn, fable-like tone, but leans into purple abstraction ("liquid gemstones," "wound in the world’s harmonic fabric"). The reliance on filter verbs and telling ("She knew," "She theorized") creates a layer of distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally stiff, distancing the reader with formal phrasing ("poignant perfume of return"). The POV stays firmly with Elara, but the filter is often intellectual rather than sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and distancing, filtering the experience through abstract summary rather than immediate sensation. The register is uniformly "high poetic," which flattens the emotional urgency and distinctness of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice aims for poetic elevation but veers into purple prose ("sacred shroud," "frigid air"). Dialogue is unnatural and functional ("Revision complete... Trust is restored"), serving as a status update rather than human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, interpreting the significance of every action for the reader ("a testament to courage"). The register leans into abstract grandeur ("constellations birthing light") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered, often telling the reader the character's state ("spirit was notably receptive") rather than showing it. The tone drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("mechanical dragon," "woven from love and wind"), creating a slight distance from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward a distancing level of abstraction ("architecture of its soul," "silent potential"). The tone is cohesive, though it sometimes prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over immediate character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice suffers from register breaks, mixing high fantasy diction with incongruous modern idioms ("when the penny dropped"). The narrative distance is too close to the author, prioritizing explanation of feelings over the character's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a suitable lyrical tone, though it occasionally drifts into "telling" emotional states. The narrative distance is stable, but the prose sometimes prioritizes poetic assertion over immediate, grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by an over-reliance on adverbs and "adjective-noun" pairings that distance the reader. The tone strains for literary profundity ("profound beauty," "mundane perception") but achieves a melodramatic effect that undercuts the urgency of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distant. Frequent use of filter verbs ("She felt," "She recognized," "She understood") creates a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience, reducing emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but stiff, marred by the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("balancedly curious") that disrupt natural syntax. The narrative distance feels clinical, summarizing emotional states ("skepticism melted into poised understanding") rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains the intended ethereal tone. However, the register often drifts into melodrama ("profound reeling hush," "sacred tension"), and the reliance on filter verbs to explain emotions distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but tends toward melodrama and adjective-heavy description ("fragile window," "gentle pulse"). The tone manages the "crashing hush" motif well, though the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a reverent tone, though it leans into "purple prose" ("fractured starlight," "dawn's first blush") that creates distance. The narration is confident but overly filtered, prioritizing poetic phrasing over immediate connection to the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic and lyrical tone appropriate for the genre. However, the mandatory phrase "quietly articulate" is inserted awkwardly, particularly the second time ("Her quietly articulate voice"), which briefly disrupts the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally breathless, leaning into elevated diction ("chaotic symphony," "defiance of gravity") that distances the reader. POV control is generally maintained, though there are moments of filter ("Aris felt," "She was witnessing") that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like atmosphere, though it occasionally relies on abstract adjectives ("tarnished wonder"). The narrative focus remains stable on Elara, maintaining a clear but somewhat distant perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a sentimental, elevated register that creates distance ("sacred and sorrowful," "quiet reverence"). The tone is cohesive, yet the reliance on filtering events through a lens of "respectful rebellion" feels somewhat performative. POV control is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly lyrical, resulting in a density of metaphors that distances the reader. The reliance on elevated register ("hands that spoke fluently," "sacred timeframe") reduces the immediacy of the character's physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately hushed, suiting the "scientific poetry" concept. However, the tone leans toward the sentimental ("whispers faded," "gentle currents"), and the reliance on filter verbs and internal summary distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice adopts a consistently elevated, mythic tone ("dawn’s first breath," "sacred interval") that creates distance rather than intimacy. This high-register poetic diction flattens the emotional texture, making the experience feel like a recitation rather than a lived moment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is overly interpretative, frequently telling the reader the emotional significance of images before they are fully visualized ("intimate understanding of locks woven from regret"). The POV shift in the final paragraph disrupts the established closeness to the locksmith.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but frequently filters the experience through explanatory phrases ("Aris trusted," "He knew"). This creates a clinical distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is polished and maintains a consistent elevated tone suitable for the fantasy setting. However, the register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("blade sheathed in velvet"), and the dialogue sounds more like written scripture than spoken language, creating distance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and interpretive, creating distance from the immediate experience. The filter of poetic diction ("woven from pure chromatic emotion") obscures the character's grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice control is severely damaged by the second paragraph, which adopts a robotic, list-like cadence ("Her motivation was... The action required was... The method was precise...") to insert prompt requirements. This creates a distance that the otherwise lyrical tone cannot overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the significance of every action immediately (e.g., explaining the tear as "humble integrity"). This reduces narrative distance and prevents the reader from inferring meaning through the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently interrupting the scene to diagnose the character's emotions for the reader ("to understand the physics of letting go"). The tone struggles to balance the intended "sophisticated melancholy" with the mechanical insertion of required phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overly elevated, "poetic" register that creates distance. The reliance on flowery descriptors ("liquid pearl," "sacred window") creates a filter of artificiality that obscures the raw immediacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and polished but suffers from over-filtering ("he felt," "he understood") and elevated abstractions. The narrative distance prevents intimacy with the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical register that fits the solitary, scientific-poetic nature of the protagonist. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing access to Aris's thoughts while maintaining the atmospheric scope of the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly atmospheric for an artist protagonist. However, it occasionally drifts into elevated, "purple" diction ("cruel impermanence," "celestial atlas") that creates distance. The filter through Elara’s tactile perception is the highlight, distinguishing the POV effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose and elevated register that creates distance ("cerulean silence," "living tapestry"). The narrative tells the reader what to feel ("quiet reverence," "joyous spiral") rather than evoking it through distinct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy lyricism but suffers from "adjective stuffing" ("crystalline stillness," "fragile ghost"). The ornate register distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the repair work.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and slightly melodramatic ("shuddered," "living vortex," "liquid-silver"), lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue functions primarily as exposition ("The nebula of respite aligns at midnight"), sounding stiff and unnatural rather than like genuine interaction between stressed survivors.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is cohesive and suitably mythic for the subject matter. It maintains a distinct, elevated register throughout. At times, the poetic diction becomes slightly breathless ("ad infinitum," "covenant of comfort"), drawing attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and tightly focused on Elara's perception. The shift from the mechanical details to the emotional relief of the family is handled smoothly without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently filtering and interpreting the character's thoughts for the reader ("His symphonically minded nature perceived"). This distancing effect prevents immersion in the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone appropriate for the setting. However, the register lacks variation and occasionally drifts into detachment, keeping the reader observing the ritual rather than experiencing the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by the tautological phrasing "emotions were emotionally contagious," which disrupts immersion. The register occasionally drifts into overwrought adjectival density ("crystalline sorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and unified, maintaining a reverent, fairytale-like quality appropriate for the genre. However, the tone often slips into sentimentality, and the narrative distance is too close to the protagonist's uncritical self-perception. The "vigorous tender" phrase repetition disrupts the voice's natural cadence, feeling inserted rather than indigenous to the narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and explanatory, relying on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") instead of immediate immersion. The tone creates a barrier to the character’s lived experience by summarizing emotions rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a distinct, elevated register suitable for a fantasy archivist, though it occasionally feels distant. The "prism-mind" filter provides a steady perspective, but the narration often explains the protagonist's feelings instead of showing them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reverent and interpretive, often telling the reader how to feel ("intensely quiet," "profound release"). It lacks distinct perceptual bias beyond the elevated, poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent elevated register fitting a royal tutor. However, the reliance on filtering verbs ("He correlated," "He translated," "He acknowledged") creates distance, telling the reader the analysis rather than showing the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly earnest and explanatory, frequently interpreting the scene for the reader ("intuitively descriptive nature perceived not just metal"). The distance is suffocatingly close, filled with filter words and interpretive summaries that block immersion. The tone struggles to separate the protagonist's "theatrical sincerity" from the narration itself, leading to a lack of distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, clashing a mythic tone with jarring, prompt-forced technical terms like "journalize" and "olfactorily sensitive." These register slips break the immersive distance required for the story's fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, fitting the lyrical mode. However, it relies heavily on filter verbs ("felt," "saw") and emotive labeling ("profound," "symphony") that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and precise, matching the protagonist's analytical nature. However, it occasionally relies on filter verbs ("he noted," "he realized") and over-explains the significance of objects rather than letting them speak.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a grandiose, distancing tone that prioritizes poetic effect over immediacy. The reliance on elevated diction ("cosmic synchronicity," "fertile vessel") creates a filter between the reader and the character's experience, making the piece feel like a mythic summary rather than a lived scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistently formal, fitting the high fantasy tone, but stumbles significantly with the ungrammatical phrasing "action of uncase." This error, likely a forced prompt insertion, breaks the narrative spell and reveals the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, mediating the protagonist's experience through analysis ("Her method demanded deliberate ambiguity") rather than immediate sensory immersion. This distance reduces the impact of the "visceral encounter" the story promises.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is a standard fantasy template that uses high-flown, abstract language ("unshakable truth," "quiet certainty") to summarize experience. This filtering distances the reader, presenting the events as a fable-like summary rather than an immediate, lived scene.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, fitting the "mystic" persona. However, it leans heavily into explaining internal states ("Validation seemed close") rather than implying them through action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental and prone to purple prose. The narration interprets the story for the reader ("profoundly wistful," "stoically sparkling") instead of allowing the imagery to carry the weight. The high diction creates a distance that muffles emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice adopts a distant, fable-like quality that prioritizes poetic summary over immediate sensory immersion. The prose maintains a consistent, elevated register, but this distance prevents intimacy with the protagonist’s experience. There is a tendency toward "telling" emotions rather than evoking them through specific voice-driven perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a specialized vocabulary (durasteel, resonance, weave). However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("phantom light," "boots whispering") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated register appropriate for the fable-like quality of the tale. While effective, the voice occasionally feels performative, leaning on "writerly" cadences ("measured in tides," "flickered its final breath") that smooth over the rougher edges of the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, leaning into purple prose ("drank the starlight," "keen its rising song") that distances the reader from the immediate action. The tone matches the high-fantasy setting but lacks the rhythmic variety needed to heighten the tension during the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a polished, mythic tone, but suffers from overwrought phrasing ("chromatic truth both fleeting and eternal"). The elevated register creates a distance that muffles the emotional immediacy of the donor heart connection.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative distance is high, often explaining the meaning of objects and feelings ("embodied quantified sorrow") rather than dramatizing them. The voice tends toward "helpful narrator syndrome," leaving little room for reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic and lyrical tone that suits the genre, but the immersion is repeatedly broken by mechanical insertions of required elements. These awkward phrasings ("This ritual demanded the method...") disrupt the otherwise smooth narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized, leaning into "purple prose" that prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over clarity. The POV remains stable, but the tendency to summarize the character's psychological state ("felt the weight of the hour," "motivation stirred") creates a distance that prevents deep immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by overwrought phrasing and unmotivated register shifts ("heuristically gentle precision"). The tone feels artificial, prioritizing poetic sentimentality over distinct character voice or grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward "purple" phrasing ("swirling sea," "intrusion," "tapestry") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the "pirate market" vibe well. However, the psychic distance pulls back too far during the action sequences, favoring exposition over immediate immersion in Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "futuristic nostalgia" tone is consistently maintained through lyrical, elevated diction that fits the prompt's request. However, the narrative voice often dominates the character's interiority, making the epiphany feel more like the author's philosophical summary than the character's lived emotional discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic, creating distance. Repetitive epithets ("charcoal-fingered hands" appears three times) and high-register poetic diction distract from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like content. However, the narrative distance slips into didactic omniscience at the end to deliver the moral, breaking the intimacy of the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the mythic quality of the setting. However, it often relies on filtering adjectives ("reverent precision," "fluid certainty") that create distance, describing the emotion of the moment rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    The POV is stable, but the narrative voice occasionally slips into "explanatory mode," labeling emotions and concepts ("A nostalgic android caretaker") instead of demonstrating them through interiority or action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice suffers from "purple prose" and register drift, with characters speaking in poetic riddles ("The lock yields only to a promise kept") that defy naturalism. The specific phrase "sandstorm calm" creates a jarring mixed metaphor—sandstorms are abrasive and chaotic, not embodiments of stillness—betraying a lack of control over imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a cohesive lyrical tone that fits the "poetic code breaker" persona. While stylistically elevated, the control is steady, though it occasionally risks distancing the reader from the immediate physical reality of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a fairy-tale lyrical quality appropriate for the genre. However, the reliance on high-register adjectives ("gleaming," "profound," "luminescence") occasionally pushes into purple prose that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and detached, prioritizing poetic abstraction over grounding. The tone lacks variation, maintaining a steady "tranquil" register that distances the reader from any sense of urgency or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally slips into stiff, writerly phrasing. Dialogue often reads as elevated prose ("The building does not yield to forceful interrogation") rather than natural speech, distancing the characters from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice leans heavily into melodrama and abstraction ("supernova of love and loss," "spectral determination") rather than grounded, specific emotion. The tone is consistent but lacks the restraint and perceptual specificity expected in high-end literary fiction, reading more like genre romance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic, high-fantasy conventions ("whisper of stone," "velvet" silence). The tone matches the content but lacks a distinct, character-specific texture beyond generic solemnity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative voice is fatally compromised by the insertion of writing-prompt terminology as diegetic narration ("progressive disclosure"), creating an analytical distance. The narrator filters the experience through labels ("her richly perceptive mind") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized, prioritizing lyrical density over narrative momentum. The high-register tone creates a distancing effect, filtering the experience through "writing" rather than immediate character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice is consistent but stiff and overly elevated, lacking a natural rhythmic variance. The repetition of complex phrases ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") within such a short space creates a mechanical, robotic effect that breaks immersion. The POV filters everything through immediate abstraction, distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately analytical for a debunker. Narrative distance occasionally collapses into explanatory labeling ("heartbreaking archive," "profound truth"), which weakens the emotional impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative head-hops rapidly between Elara, Hemlock, and Valerius without clear structural demarcation, creating a distancing synopsis effect. The narrative voice is overly helpful, summarizing meaning ("This object was her lens") instead of trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, constantly diagnosing the character's emotional state instead of allowing it to unfold. The tone is overly sentimental, and the repetition of specific clunky phrases fractures the immersive quality of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized and adjectival ("fleeting golden sunset," "ethereal canvas"), creating a distance from the immediate action. The tone borders on melodramatic, prioritizing poetic cadence over narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and polished in a high-fantasy register, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory filtering ("She thought of her valley community"). The repetition of the specific phrase "softly purposeful" (lines 88 and 133) diminishes the precision of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is stable but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," interpreting Elara's feelings immediately ("profound shift," "relic of profound courage") instead of letting actions speak. The voice is functional but lacks a distinct texture, often slipping into explanatory mode during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and sentimental ("divine precision," "tears traced clean paths"), lacking the restraint required for a high-band literary piece. The tone tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but leans heavily on filter verbs ("Elara felt," "she saw") and explanatory interiority. The tone successfully balances the "irreverent awe" prompt but often tells the reader how to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but tends toward an overly sentimental, elevated register ("sacred spaces," "legacy echoing") that creates distance. The POV stays firmly with Elara, but the filtering often tells us how to feel about the scene rather than letting the imagery do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone, but it creates excessive distance through passive constructions ("The required action was," "The only viable method demanded"). The narration acts as a "helpful explainer," summarizing the significance of events instead of allowing the reader to experience the sensory immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, favoring high-lyric abstraction over grounded observation. The tone aims for profundity but achieves distance, with the narrator explaining the meaning of every moment ("lullaby of resilience") instead of letting the reader experience it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.6)
    POV control is weak, with frequent head-hopping between Elara, Clara, and Liam within the same scene, violating the single-scene/single-POV default. The narrative voice is consistently overwrought, prioritizing poetic posturing over clarity or character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fantasy tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the POV creates a layer of distance that prevents deep emotional connection, filtering the experience through formal observation rather than visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is overly sentimental, relying on flowery abstractions ("alchemically transmute," "threads of starlight"). Dialogue feels staged and unnatural, particularly the child's exclamation, which reads like a thematic thesis statement rather than authentic speech. The tone lacks the restraint required for the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("weathered innocence") and an overly reverent tone that distances the reader. The narrative distance is somewhat remote, summarizing Aris's feelings and history rather than immersing us in his immediate sensory processing. The "reticent scholar" persona is maintained, but the prose texture lacks variety in rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, maintaining a steady lyrical rhythm. However, the register occasionally drifts into sentimentality or over-poeticism ("supernova clarity," "cartography of devotion") that draws attention to the writing itself rather than the experience. The voice feels slightly performative, prioritizing beautiful phrasing over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a high, lyrical register appropriate for the "sage" persona. However, the reliance on elevated abstractions ("cosmic indifference," "covenant of order") sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene. The perspective is stable, but the tone risks melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and overly "helpful," often summarizing emotions ("grief a stone in her throat") instead of showing them. The POV distance shifts uncomfortably, and the tone remains monotonal in its reverence, lacking the modulation needed for a dynamic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, but the exact repetition of the phrase "quietly deliberate" three times in such a short text flattens the texture. It suggests a limited lexical range or an unpolished reliance on a character tag.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, utilizing elevated, lyrical phrasing ("cartographer of grace") that creates distance. The tone feels overly guided, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the emotional weight of each moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice aims for a lyrical style but is disrupted by meta-commentary and awkward insertions of prompt phrases ("tone of zephyr bloom"). The narrator frequently filters experience through explanation rather than immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and interpretive ("crystalline cartography"), creating narrative distance. The triple repetition of the specific phrase "honeyed hush" feels mechanical and intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but adopts an overly elevated, adjectival register ("profound, swirling hush") that distances the reader. The tone feels constructed and rigid, lacking the modulation required to make the emotional shift at the ending feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, elevated register that prioritizes poetic summary over immediate grounding. The tone often drifts into melodrama ("only the heart could decipher," "tears traced clean paths"), creating a barrier to genuine emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a reverent, meditative tone that suits the subject matter. The close third-person perspective is consistent, though the elevated register occasionally distances the reader from the visceral physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying on "telling" assertions ("His peripherally focused nature immediately registered") and filter verbs ("Kael saw") that reduce immediacy. The register is slightly elevated but creates a barrier to immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and appropriately mythic, maintaining a consistent "high fantasy" tone. The writer manages the challenging technical vocabulary of the prompt well, integrating it into a cohesive POV without slipping into generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the character’s thoughts and symbols ("She sought to contain the essence") instead of trusting the imagery to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but over-filters the experience through interpretative summaries ("perceived the halt as a convergence"). The close-third perspective frequently tells the reader how to interpret the protagonist's emotions rather than demonstrating them through raw perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but marred by clunky, prompt-driven phrasing ("Blessed with a functionally creative attribute") that breaks narrative immersion. The tone is overly reverent and explanatory, distancing the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple prose" and melodrama ("profound stillness," "bleeding faint apricot"). The tone feels performative, prioritizing poetic-sounding phrases over narrative precision, resulting in a "precious" rather than urgent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic abstraction ("sacred void," "cathedral of deceit"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("she saw how," "she recalled") which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The tone feels somewhat manufactured to fit the prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, marred by awkward passive constructions ("embodying the attribute of being") that feel like forced insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it leans heavily into "writerly" affectation and poetic introspection. The dialogue, however, feels artificial; characters speak in aphorisms and thematic thesis statements rather than natural speech. The POV remains stable, focusing closely on Elara’s internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fable-like tone. However, it occasionally lapses into overwrought description ("fragile bridge over the chasm of despair") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from significant overwriting and a tendency toward melodrama ("compassion so deep it felt like gravity"). The high poetic register creates distance, making the narration feel like a performance of profundity rather than an intimate perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is marred by the robotic repetition of specific prompt phrases (e.g., "realistically imaginative," "sidereal patience") exactly three times each, creating a disjointed and artificial rhythm. The tone leans into purple prose ("bruised twilight," "liquid light") that obscures clarity without adding depth. The mechanical insertion of required terms prevents a distinct or natural narrative persona from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistently lofty but suffers from relentless purple phrasing ("tears of joy," "breath that stirred cosmic dust") that distances the reader. The tone is monotonous in its reverence, lacking the modulation needed to make the "troubling" aspect of the serenity felt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a sentimental, elevated register ("silent majesty," "sacred vessel") that distances the reader. The "spectral mentor" device feels slightly jarring within the otherwise grounded emotional reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from stiffness and an over-reliance on abstract nouns ("profound emergence"). The repetition of the phrase "ethically diligent" to satisfy a requirement disrupts the narrative flow and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly adjectival and sentimental, directing the reader's emotions ("poignant ache," "reverence") rather than evoking them. The tone leans heavily into melodrama, preventing a grounded connection to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and elevated but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently pausing to explain the character's motivation and the meaning of her tools. While the POV is stable, the reliance on expository interiority creates a distance that prevents immersion in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a "weathered yet warm" fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to Elara’s perception and infusing the prose with her copyist’s precision. While the tone is cohesive, the register sometimes drifts into a slightly breathless poeticism that feels stylistic rather than purely character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and directive, frequently using filter verbs ("felt," "understood") and abstract emotional labels ("profound somber marvel") to tell the reader how to react. This creates a barrier to intimacy, prioritizing poetic posturing over embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative and precise tone that fits the "wannabe philosopher" persona. The vocabulary ("empirical," "sedimentary," "crystalline") reinforces the character's worldview. Narrative distance is stable, though it sometimes drifts into explaining the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical ("low as settling snow"), fitting the healing tone. However, the recurring intrusion of specific prompt phrases interrupts the rhythm, making the voice feel constrained by a checklist rather than flowing organically from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, clashing a mythic/reverent tone with the sudden, clinical jargon of "synaptic plasticity." The narration suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly interpreting Arlo's actions for the reader rather than trusting the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    Voice distinction is weak; the engineer adopts the same poetic, elevated register as the keeper ("blinded by beauty," "golden tear") immediately upon reading the riddle. This convergence flattens the contrast between the technocrat and the mystic.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly filtered through poeticisms that distance the reader from the immediate action. The reliance on adjective-heavy description and flowery metaphors ("bay’s breath kissed," "liquid gold") creates a layer of artifice that muffles the character's distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and over-reliant on abstract nouns ("shattered certainty," "profound duality"), creating a detached, clinical tone. The POV filters the experience through a lens of omniscient summary rather than embodied sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying on filter verbs ("She knew," "She recalled") and abstract nouns to convey state. The narration often explains the character's emotions to the reader instead of allowing them to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "creative writing" affectation, prioritizing poetic turns of phrase over narrative drive. The tone is uniformly reverent and soft, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish the gritty city from the sanctuary. The prose often filters experience through high-register abstraction ("grammar of a steadying hand") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate ("cloying sweetness of memory," "rosewater dread"), creating a distancing effect. The tone borders on melodramatic, and the interiority often summarizes emotional states rather than embodying them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on repetitive tagging and "tell" phrases that dilute authority. The repetition of key descriptors (e.g., "bleak exhilaration" used as a label rather than an evoked mood) distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.0)
    The gothic voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("tasted of rust and regret," "visual void"). Dialogue is theatrical and declamatory, fitting the surreal tone but lacking naturalism or distinct character rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and consistent, fitting the mythic tone. However, the mechanical and repetitive insertion of specific required phrases disrupts the rhythm and breaks immersion, feeling more like a checklist than an organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately lyrical for the mythic setting. The POV remains firmly with Elara. The tone is controlled, though it occasionally drifts into a slightly distant, academic register ("syntactic verb," "fundamental frequency") that cools the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    The monologue addressed to the ivy feels artificial and stagey, functioning as "as-you-know" exposition rather than authentic voice. The tone is uniformly solemn and academic, lacking the texture of a living consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly mediating, creating a "helper narrator" effect that interprets every emotion for the reader. The prose suffers from "emotional ventriloquism," asserting complex feelings with certainty rather than allowing them to arise from the scene. The tone is uniformly reverent, lacking dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the forced insertion of specific phrasing that feels unnatural and disrupts the rhythm. The tone is overly elevated and serious, occasionally straining for profundity at the expense of naturalism. Narrative distance is maintained, but the mechanical usage of prompt terms draws attention to the authorial hand.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, using diagnostic phrasing ("core concept," "paradoxical state") to explain the magic system. This creates an academic distance that buffers the reader from the protagonist's emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into a breathless, elevated register that occasionally drifts into purple prose ("soul with the permanence of starlight"). The narrative distance is controlled, but the tone risks melodrama over genuine emotional gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.4)
    Dialogue is stiff and expository ("You stand where starlight converges," "It moves as if the heavens are pulling truth"), lacking natural rhythm or subtext. The narrative voice tends toward purple prose ("perpetual canvas of surprise") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is marred by meta-commentary and structural repetition ("His motivation was...", "His method was..."). These constructions flatten the POV, creating a distance that feels like a synopsis rather than an immersive experience. The tone veers into melodrama ("dusk bled," "drank the fading light").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, fitting the high-stakes diplomatic context, though it occasionally slips into emotional ventriloquism where thoughts appear as perfectly drafted thematic sentences. The perspective is stable, but the high register distances the reader from the visceral reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a distinct melancholic tone, though it occasionally dips into melodrama ("impossible clarity," "crystalline moment"). There is a reliance on filter verbs and explanatory telling that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "telling" emotions, most notably in the phrase "heart pounding with jaded wonder." The close third-person perspective often drifts into summary of internal states ("integrating regret with mercy") rather than embodying them in perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the fairy-tale mode, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory. The control is steady, but the relentless poetic register creates a distance that muffles the character’s immediate experience. The tone creates a cohesive "cosmic" vibe but lacks the rhythmic variety needed to heighten tension during the ritual’s climax.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent, high-lyric register, though it occasionally veers into distancing purple prose ("saline benediction"). While the tone is cohesive, the reliance on abstract emotional summary prevents a closer psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and diagnostic, maintaining a high psychic distance that filters immediate experience through abstract summaries ("symphony of sorrow transmuted by love"). This creates a "legend-speak" tone that distances the reader from the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    The mid-scene head-hop to Mano breaks the established intimacy with Elara solely to deliver exposition about the prophecy. The narrative voice is consistently elevated but feels detached and poeticized, prioritizing flowery phrasing over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a tendency toward purple prose ("drank twilight and exhaled soft starlight"). The POV control is stable, but the tone sometimes drifts into melodrama ("unlocked hope itself") that feels unearned by the brief action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent—elevated and mythic—fitting the fable-like quality. However, the tone remains somewhat distant, and the reliance on high-register phrasing keeps the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretive, constantly diagnosing the character's experience ("understanding dawning," "vigil in pause"). This filtering creates distance, preventing intimate access to the character's immediate sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "philosopher" persona, though it often drifts into dense, abstract latinate diction ("intentionality," "articulation," "vulnerability"). While the POV remains stable, the narrative distance is somewhat cold, prioritizing the appreciation of its own metaphors over immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly curated and poeticized, prioritizing "beautiful" phrasing over naturalism or character distinction. Dialogue feels performative and sermonizing ("Luminous fracture," "This seed doesn’t mourn itself"), sounding more like a written manifesto than spoken interaction between friends.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the magical realism genre. However, the prose tends toward melodrama ("cruel punctuation," "bled through"), which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The narrative distance is stable, staying close to Elara’s perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, using poetic diction that feels performative and creates distance from the character's immediate physical reality. Narration frequently summarizes emotional states ("felt the weight," "whimsical heart soared") instead of dramatizing them through distinct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and grandiloquent ("chromatic truth," "silent cartography"), creating unnecessary psychic distance. The lyrical tone feels performative, prioritizing "storyteller" cadence over character-specific interiority.

No dialogue required; voice sustains hush through selective detail and rhythmic control, teaching the amplified-quiet pattern early and holding it to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent—light inverted, scent catalogued, breath metered—and syntax lengthens/shortens with inhale/exhale rhythm. No head-hop; unreliability never claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s synesthetic perception; diction (“supple willow,” “crystalline streams”) remains within her horticultural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s selective perception; diction (“crystal whispering,” “ambiguously clear”) is consistent and motivated by registrar precision.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s post-fever perception; no head-hop. Diction—”crystalline air,” “sepia ink blurred the lower margin”—is precise yet lyrical, matching an oracle trained to notice minutiae.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Perceptual signature is strong: decay-moth phrasing, synesthetic “beads as frozen tears,” and headlamp-dictated sensory hierarchy maintain Leo’s explorer voice. Register stays inside his diction; no scholar intrusion. Slight cadence repetition—sentence openings cluster on noun/verb ticks—prevents 8.6. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, syntax elongating then compressing with breath of descent. Diction stays within a keeper’s lexicon—“cryptic folds,” “emerald thread”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is hush-weighted: every noticed thing is texture or hush, reinforcing motif. Rhythm modulates from cathedral cadence to single-line pulse, echoing the regenerative silence.

No head-hopping; Elara’s interior accessed only through her single spoken line—indirection maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is priestly-liturgical: loop-layered, incense-tinged, rhythmic as chant. Diction—“knotted into fragile order,” “cold vine coiling inward”—is specific and consistent. Compression is purposeful: “loop pedal priest” teaches the pattern early; the final pedal-release pays it off. One clause—“the assumption is that purity requires singularity”—slips into outline-register, but cadence recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance, sliding into synesthetic free indirect: “stones became xylophone.” Rhythm accelerates with anaphora of memory placement, then exhales in final paragraph—intentional cadence mirroring symphony. Diction stays within Elara’s artisanal lexicon (“fossilized map,” “logarithmic curve”) yet avoids purple. No dialogue, so voice distinctness evaluated solely through narration; it passes. Filter verbs used sparingly and purposefully. Read-aloud ear test: variation natural, no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: long sensual sentences that mirror labyrinthine folds, then fracture into shorter units at the acceptance beat. Perceptual signature is consistent—attention to reflected light, wet stone, heartbeat-rhythm of runes. No POV drift; “gravity defier” stays within plausible lexicon for an immortal wanderer. The only micro-slip is “periodically eternal” flagged as attribute-label, but it is immediately re-enacted by the tear-loop, keeping voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s tactile attention; no head-hop. Prose rhythm mimics her narrowed perception—short clauses under pressure (“deep thump traveled up her arms”) then longer reflective swells. Kael’s signed lines are spare, artisanal, distinct from lyrical narrative. Filter verbs are scarce; perception rendered as physical event (“the warmth of a classroom sunbeam”) rather than “she felt warmth.”

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited clings to Elara’s meteorologist perception: barometric notation, cloud classification, atmospheric deposit—lexis she owns. Rhythm modulates from longer, calmer sentences in the courtyard to clipped, colder fragments when she unscrews the tube. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she noted") are rare and voice-motivated. The prose itself becomes anemometric—steady, calibrated, persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited clings to Elara’s acoustic perception; syntax lengthens and softens to mimic resonance (“a golden thread stitching hope into absence”). No head-hopping; every metaphor is filtered through her sensorium (shipwreck ribs as echo-chambers).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close sustains Kael’s perceptual idiom—electric tingles, scent calibration—without head-hopping.

Distinctive rhythmic signature held across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—“whimsically attentive gaze honed spotting forged bills of lading”—is consistent and character-specific. Syntax loosens slightly under emotion (“cautious exuberance warmed his chest”) without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Liam’s “Sentiment overruled sense” carries subtext. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person adheres to Elara’s perceptual bias—green-stained hands, harmonic branches—without purple excess. Syntax modulates: long breathless cadence for awe, abrupt “She knelt” for climax. No head-hop; Kael’s interior accessed only through Elara’s sympathetic inference. Dialogue sparse, rough, age-true.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Illustrator’s perceptual signature—microscopic moss veins, color of a voice—threads every sentence; syntax stays controlled, painterly, never drifts into generic fantasy diction. Elision (“borrowed duration”) is taught early and repaid at climax, keeping psychic distance steady.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person prose maintains a consistent perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s selective attention (“language of endurance”). No head-hopping; compressed diction under pressure (“vacuum that felt both sacred and sorrowful”) is purposeful and paid off. Rhythm modulates cleanly between ceremonial slowness and the decisive final drop.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: sound of “sapphire hush,” smell of cherry tobacco, iron conduit’s cold. Syntax lengthens during stealth, contracts at emergence, mirroring risk and release. No dialogue until Evans’ whispered “Arthur’s interview…,” a perfect breakage of silence. Voice modulation meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature consistent: horticultural lexicon, tactile attention to veins, soil, micro-life. Rhythm controlled—long breathing sentences calm after storm, mirroring new stance. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Distinction maintained even under emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is painterly synesthesia: “consciousness a perpetual canvas,” “rain trails—silver threads weaving sky to earth.” Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath, mirroring tide and fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction is restrained, slightly archaic (“weather-stained cloak,” “calloused hands”) fitting village seer register.

No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived; narrative voice remains singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited clings to Elara’s salt-archivist perception: “salt-damp air clinging to her woolen shawl.” Diction—“verdigris,” “linseed oil,” “leaded window”—stays within her restoration lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains mapper’s precise diction throughout, syntactic rhythm mirroring her cataloguing gaze. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact—narrator reports only what Elara can perceive. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor chain (“drainage grates into symphonies”) is character-consistent, not decorative. Only micro-drift: “conceptual aperture” moment edges elevated but stays within plausible mapper lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s body and perception; salt spray on “his cheeks” during entanglement is a sanctioned fusion moment. Syntax lengthens under entanglement pressure, then contracts at dawn, mirroring breath. No head-hop; the mentor’s whisper arrives as anchored memory. Voice distinctiveness could still sharpen with one signature idiom unique to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is high-lyric, mythic register consistent with immortal POV; diction stays within plausible cosmic scale. Rhythmic control in long sentences mirrors tidal time-sense; shorter bursts mark rupture. No dialogue, so no convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—brass pot “felt heavy with history,” a con artist’s daughter’s metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric-staccato, mimicking the flicker of fluorescent light and the scratch of charcoal: “a cherry blossom cascading like frozen laughter” is perceptual signature, not ornament. Syntax shortens under time pressure—final notations collapse to telegram length. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks. Register never drifts above Elara’s self-taught lexicon; even “incandescent restraint” is framed as her own evaluative label for the artifact, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to the keeper’s synesthetic filter; cranes “punctuate,” wind carries “fragmented sentences.” Rhythm swells and subsides like the tide, mirroring accretive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited remains tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—“salt-tinged breath,” “cinematic clarity”—with rhythmic compression matching emotional surge. No head-hopping; psychic distance deliberately narrows during the hum. Distinct syntax—“gloomy cheerfulness,” “quiet companion”—creates memorable texture. One clause of slightly elevated abstraction (“universal riddle”) is within tolerance.

Syntax mirrors his orderly intuition—balanced clauses, rhythmic semicolons—without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested; narrative idiom remains consistent. One filter-verb cluster (“felt like erasure”) is forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is geologist-poetic—“sharp crescent,” “bowl-shaped scar,” “billion-year-old rock layers.” Rhythm swells toward the shutter click, then thins for descent, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; slight register lift toward the lyrical is earned by the elegiac mode.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s tactile perceptions; diction of "resin," "conductive silver dust," "spider-silk brush" belongs to an artisan’s lexicon.

Distinct perceptual signature satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close maintains perceptual signature rooted in sub-sea technician: “deep-sea instinct,” “geological time.” Syntax elongates/shortens with oxygen debt, creating pressure rhythm. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly Aris-bound. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“he saw children” is literal memory insertion).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s perceptual signature—stone-smooth fingertip, salt-rime, copperlight—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for breath-held hush, fragments (“Since the collapse”) under pressure. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic, goal-driven: “Another phantom, Kael?” condenses decades of doubt. No head-hopping; Elias’s interior is read only through Kael’s eye and exterior cues.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric, frost-bitten diction—“starless dome,” “ashen-veil,” “resonant song”—maintains ghost POV without head-hop. Compression taught early (“cumulative: 28”) and paid off in rhythmic cadence at bloom crescendo. Syntax mirrors spectral flicker: long clauses collapse into single-note fragment at climax. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)

Distinctive without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: “threads of starlight silver,” “golden anchor,” diction consistent with artisan-mystic POV.

No head-hop or register drift under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filters—Spanish moss as veil, mud as judge. Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during condensation vision, then exhales into longer cadence at release. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he saw”) because they flag mediated memory, not exposition. No head-hop; Elara’s dialogue is observed from the outside, her interior withheld, preserving distance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric yet grounded: “twilight bled through the glass ceiling” stays within a translator’s sensory lexicon. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into whispered anaphora (“You are safe. You are loved.”) to mimic breath control under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person telepathic statue POV is stable, with diction chiseled to match: “incisively kind precision,” “stone-cold still.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-clause beats as glass dissolves—then widens into lyrical cadence for the choral close. No head-hop; psychic distance controlled. Filter verbs serve voice, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains a mathematician’s perceptual signature—abstraction married to tactile precision (“balancedly daring resolve,” “rigorous calculus and topology”).

Voice remains distinct under pressure, meriting high-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: moonlight pools behind lids, brush hair “drinks” light.

No head-hopping; nurse’s interior is unknowable, read only through micro-gesture—wildflower tuck, note—preserving POV modesty. Diction stays within painter’s lexicon: pigment, wash, stroke, canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s curator perception; syntax lengthens with cataloguing gaze, shortens under urgency (“We gather the herb. We bake tonight”). Diction—“rosewater dread,” “protective hymn”—is POV-plausible, not purple. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Hemlock’s rasp against Elara’s calm curator cadence. One micro drift: “cloudy eyes widening” borders on external omniscience, but context keeps it legible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to advisor’s perceptual filter: rust taste, coin-cold fingers, selective attention to glow and rot.

No head-hop; psychic distance control precise. Voice modulation under pressure is evident, meeting the 9− quick test, though a few adjective stacks (“repulsive allure of decay”) flirt with purple, capping at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers at the prophet’s shoulder, filtering every image through cloud-reading perception; syntax lengthens and contracts with the rising wind.

No head-hop; psychic distance pulls back only for the reflective last paragraph, justified as Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bandwidth; diction (“logical page indexer,” “fiber weave,” “quill-key-wave”) belongs to her professional idiom. Rhythm lengthens during calm observation, compresses into single-clause beats at the stamp flip. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is active, every metaphor anchored in her tactile world. Voice is distinct enough to survive the blackout reboot at the end without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is lantern-maker (she sees “silver-leafed blooms,” hears quartz “hum”). Syntax lengthens during ascent, contracts during fold—rhythmic control mirrors emotional altitude. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks.

Syntax breathes—long cadences for surf-like rumination, clipped fragments at the cut. No dialogue to test, but interior monologue avoids therapeutic label-speak. Voice distinctiveness could sharpen further with idiosyncratic diction specific to black-market forgery craft.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lingers inside Elias’s perceptual filter—“furrowed hush,” “tactile anchor”—syntax lengthens for calm, shortens for dagger flash.

Voice is distinct and sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person受限 inside Arlo’s perceptual field: sound of wires “humming a faint, grounding song,” taste of salt spray, brass chill. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“impossible clarity, a diamond needle…”) then shortens at decision (“He secured…”). No head-hop; psychic distance tightens only at wipe-dew beat. Dialogue absent by design; internal whistle and shanty serve as voice modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)

The orchard’s voice—leaves, breeze, root pulse—replaces her own, a clean transfer of narrative agency to environment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly moored to Elara’s perceptual filter—starlight “bleeds,” ink “drinks.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath-deprivation, producing a rhythmic signature. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; elliptical compression is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Compressed lyric syntax (“winking hush where shadows leaned close”) matches Kael’s inventor precision; no filter-verb clutter. The risk of euphony is controlled: varying sentence lengths keep cadence from crystallizing into chant.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: tidal equations, stellar cartography, logarithmic spiral.

Diction stays within her lexicon—“sacred patterns,” “cosmic resonance”—without academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)

No head-hop; the single POV holds. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she felt the storm’s vibration”) because they tether abstract rarefaction to bodily perception. The mentor’s voice is quoted, not ventriloquized, keeping idiom singular.

    Third-person hovers at a monkish distance that matches Elias’s slow syntax; long vowel cadences mimic placid breathing. No head-hopping; perception stays gardener-specific—leaf veining, salt weight in air. Filter verbs (“he saw Elara’s silhouette”) are minimal and serve the meditative tempo. Minor slip: “rhythmically placid” repeats four times, a touch self-conscious, but cadence remains controlled through peak beat.

Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter sentences at the stillpoint (“She had arrived.”), lyrical flow in description. Voice remains consistent, poetic but precise, with no register drift or head-hopping.
