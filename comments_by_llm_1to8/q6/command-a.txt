  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is consistent (glass-artist metaphors: "natural tapestry," "fleeting beauty of moments"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("scorched testament," "drifting resonance") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. No dialogue to evaluate. Elara's way of noticing is selective and metaphor-driven, but the voice doesn't modulate meaningfully under pressure—the final paragraph's tone matches the opening despite the stakes rising.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with diction that balances lyric compression ("winterglass," "silently expressive") and concrete detail (striking the fork, scanning papers). Distance is consistent, filtering sensory input and reflection through Elara's musician-translator lens. Kael's signing and Elara's heat-mapping device dialogue function as action and subtext. However, phrases like "capsize survivor, though not of a ship" and "translate silence into music" occasionally drift toward metaphor-as-thesis rather than lived perception. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-particular; "her world had capsized" reads slightly external. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Elias's perceptual filter (lantern, touch, professional lens on rest) is consistent. Diction stays within register with minor slips ("ethereal light," "testament to resilience" edge toward elevated abstraction under pressure). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the fragment search. No dialogue on the page to assess. One recurring syntactic pattern: "The [noun], [appositive], [verb]" appears in multiple beats, creating light template cadence. Voice is competent but not highly distinctive; the undertaker's idiom feels generic rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries some texture ("hollowed," "amplified quiet"), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("defiance against the isolation the sanctions had imposed"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven in the widow exchange; the gathering speech feels declarative but fits Mara's role. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a lyric, elevated diction ("skeletal ribcage draped in wisteria," "foggy lucidity of twilight sharpening into clarity") consistent with a camera obscura artist's perceptual signature. However, the register occasionally drifts into generic spiritual phrasing ("wellspring waiting to be shared") that could belong to any mystical tale. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but lacks the micro-variations under stress that would distinguish exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("otherworldly glow," "elusive essence," "infinite depth") that matches the lyric intent, though phrases like "quaking reverie" and "retrocognitive entrapment" feel imported from the prompt rather than character-specific perception. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in ways any hedge maze designer might, without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests don't apply.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent narrative distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("staggering grace," "macabre rhythm") that clashes with action-beat urgency. The liberator's perceptual signature is generic; internal voice ("Their goal was clear," "They worked methodically") reads as neutral rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter (colors-as-whispers) establishes voice signature, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("battered marvel of human experience") incongruent with sensory immediacy. The prose favors declarative summary over free-indirect texture under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance widens at closure into essayistic reflection, flattening the POV's embodied lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Lira with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is inconsistent: "golden-hour portrait thief" and "luminous disbelief" feel imposed rather than character-particular. Dialogue is functional but uniform in register; Lira and Elara speak with identical syntactic polish. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in emotional beats without clear voice motivation. Psychic distance shifts are subtle and purposeful during the tower climb.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable and the voice carries a consistent lyric register. Elara's self-narration ("First, the crucible must be heated... And neither will the heart") establishes a perceptual signature. However, the prose drifts into elevated diction ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully spirited precision") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue; internal voice is clean but occasionally slips into abstraction during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"her heart pounded," "her breath catching"—lacking character-specific filter. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("timeless embrace," "coalesced into a single, clear voice") that sits uneasily with stunt-double pragmatism. The seashell's whisper as "a language she couldn't understand but felt in her bones" gestures toward interiority but remains vague. Voice is competent but lacks the rhythmic control or embodied specificity that would elevate it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent, with elevated diction ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") that fits an oracular register. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, repeated abstract descriptors ("quiet intensity," "private smile," "unseen whispers") flatten specificity, and the perceptual signature does not shift under the ritual's pressure. No dialogue is present to assess. Phrase stems recur: "The oracle…" opens multiple paragraphs without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Unit-7's sensor-mediated perception ("its sensors detecting," "felt itself being pulled"). Diction is controlled and apt for the robot protagonist. The prose modulates appropriately during the musical climax, compressing into lyric fragments ("everywhere and nowhere at once"). However, interiority leans on abstract philosophical language ("something deeper, something it couldn't yet articulate") rather than character-particular texture, and the final epiphany summarizes rather than letting the reader infer from concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV (Elara) is stable with no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("ambiguously clear," "resonant hush," "petrichor") that remains consistent but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("transparency could mend what had frayed"). Dialogue is minimal; Kian's two lines feel poetic and on-theme but lack subtext or resistance. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts, but the perceptual signature leans toward thematic narration rather than character-specific noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (garden as sanctuary, hands as gnarled, time bending) and vocabulary stays within an older gardener's plausible register. Reflection density is high (~35% of text) but anchored to present stimuli (marbles, maze, sunlight) and interleaved with micro-choices (polishing ritual, marble placement), so BRR exception applies; no Q6 cap. However, rhythmic monotony emerges in the middle section with repetitive "He thought," "He felt," "Elias realized" stems across adjacent paragraphs, and free-indirect style occasionally slips into filter stacks ("began to see," "seemed to respond," "felt a strange sense") that dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and psychic distance is controlled. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("ethereal," "temporal fabric," "subdued awakenings") that reads writerly rather than mechanic-specific, and filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she knew," "she realized," "she glanced") without voice motivation. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—breath fogging, heart pounding, knuckles whitening—rather than character-particular, and the prose converges on template cadence during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled psychic distance. Diction occasionally inflates ("inexplicable pull," "profound sense of peace") but remains mostly grounded in Clara's perceptual filter. The phrase "lately inspired" and "as if the music itself had been trapped" use filter constructions that suit the dreamy register. However, voice lacks strong perceptual signature—Clara's noticing (water, program, ghost) reads generically rather than musician-specific. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping; Elara's perceptual signature (tracing lines, peripheral awareness, auroral sorrow) carries voice texture. The wanderer's dialogue, however, reads generically wise—lexicon and rhythm do not distinguish from Elara's narration under pressure. Elara's interiority leans on elevated, abstract diction ("liminal," "margins," "jagged shard") that remains static across emotional beats rather than modulating with stress. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a pang") cluster in the key smudge beat without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at the story's hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is generally clear, though phrases like "drowsy alertness" and "weight of a swallowed truth" edge toward stock metaphor. The final paragraph's tidy closure ("She had found her truth, and with it, a sense of peace") shifts into summary mode that flattens narrative distance. Internal voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Mara's way of noticing does not feel character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cryptic folds," "regenerative silence," "drift of untold seasons") that feels externally imposed rather than filtered through a character-specific perceptual signature. The phrase "grips reality loosely" is told as attribute rather than shown through skewed perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Narration is competent but lacks a distinct rhythmic or lexical signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited through Elara, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, mellow register consistent with Elara's profession ("lullaby," "symphony," "tether to a time when wonder felt infinite"). Finn's dialogue reads age-appropriate ("It's like the sky is broken"), and Elara's voice is distinct and internally coherent. However, the narrative distance occasionally drifts into helpful-narrator territory, over-explaining Elara's motivations ("her motivation had always been to nurture lifelong wonder") when the scene could have dramatized them. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is stable third-person with elevated diction ("bronze quiet," "displaced axis," "sensitively perceptive") that occasionally drifts into label-speak. Free indirect style is clean but generic; Elara's perceptual signature is not distinct or biased in character-specific ways. Narrative certainty remains high throughout; no uncertainty or inference reads as inference. The climactic beat ("her mind probing the depths of the tapestry's imagery, her heart beating in time with the dragons' roar") recycles stock interiority without embodied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains elevated, abstract diction throughout ("enigmatic fortunes," "latent power," "symphony of self-discovery") that sits at odds with the immediate sensory reality of a restaurant kitchen. Psychic distance is consistent but too far from Li Wei's embodied experience; free indirect style is absent, replaced by omniscient summary. No dialogue appears. The prose is grammatically clean but syntactically uniform, favoring long compound sentences with stacked clauses that flatten urgency. POV remains stable, but the narrator's certainty about Li Wei's interior state ("motivation was clear," "renewed purpose") exceeds what the dramatized action earns.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.4)
    Voice is homogeneous elevated-register abstraction ("threads," "void given form," "symphony of inquiry") without perceptual signature or rhythmic shift under pressure. POV distance is stable (third limited) but narrator certainty exceeds what the priest can plausibly observe ("a being of pure assumption, feeding on unquestioned beliefs"). No dialogue. Prose reads as committee voice — "cosmic event," "muffled clarity," "stillness that cloaked the anchor" — generic philosophical phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. Orientation debt applied in Q2 carries cap at 7.8; line-level issues independently warrant this score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated ("liminal space," "distillation of memory and longing") but consistent within a lyric register. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative voice. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature is generic—any introspective narrator could notice these details—and does not degrade under the mentioned exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited holds steadily, but diction drifts into abstract register ("periodically eternal nature," "darkening brightness," "procedural generation") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Internal voice is generic—stock phrases like "the weight of her gift" and "hope mingled with dread" lack perceptual signature. No dialogue appears to test subtext or voice distinction. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy. Under peak stress (the convergence of timelines), syntax does not compress or intensify; the rhythm remains steady and explanatory throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (vibrations through feet, hands, core), and free indirect style is generally clean. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("raw, aching aliveness," "symphony of existence") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a deaf drum maker. Filter verbs ("felt," "noticed," "realized") cluster in the transformation passage without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Elias's perceptual filter (trained to intuit patterns, values tranquility) colors some observations, but diction occasionally drifts into elevating abstractions ("symphony," "burden and a promise") that feel authorial rather than character-specific. The masked figure's dialogue is functional but generic. Distance control is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Rhythm modulates across beats without major artifacts, though the final paragraph's summary cadence ("he had always…but now he understood") reads explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature favors poetic rhythm and metaphor ("the frayed rope…like a forgotten promise," "time felt both infinite and fleeting"). Diction is consistent and elevated throughout, matching the reflective stance. The phrase "ethically playful" appears once as narratorial label rather than dramatized trait, and some filter verbs ("his eyes tracing," "his gaze drifting") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction is elevated but consistent ("serene defiance," "pulse with quiet urgency"). Perceptual signature is present in Elara's acoustic sensitivity. However, interiority leans on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") and the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("The mendicant's bowl... was a relic of a time when..."). Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV holds stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register ("molten gold," "affectionate detachment"). However, diction drifts into abstraction during peak beats ("fuse insight with empathy," "tapestry of feeling") where embodied perception would serve better. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Elara's way of noticing does not feel character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV third limited; distance is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (cargo broker noticing "silent contributors") colors her attention. Dialogue is brief, natural, and advances plot ("Is everything alright?" triggers the envelope exchange; Clara's grandmother line seeds closure). Diction remains consistent, though some phrasing trends generic ("her mind racing," "her voice soft"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the ending maintains narrative stance without overclaiming. Voice is competent but not distinct enough to lift the score higher—syntax and rhythm do not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the attention to light, refraction, and craft detail, but diction often drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. Echo's dialogue—"You've been searching for me, but what you've found is yourself"—reads as thematic pronouncement rather than naturalistic speech. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. Voice is consistent but lacks the rhythmic modulation or compression under peak pressure that would signal mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual filters (illustrator's eye for "hidden rhythms"). However, diction drifts into elevated register unmotivated by Mara's interiority: "uncage the moments trapped between seconds," "eternal song of time." Filter verbs stack in the opening ("felt," "felt," "looked up, squinting") without voice-motivated purpose. The narrative withholds how the pendant works until the pool revelation, but this elision does not create friction that pays off in altered tactics. Syntactic variety is present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's focus on patterns and magic, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dovetailed into a theory," "fabric of emotion itself") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Psychic distance remains consistent. The mentor's journal entries provide a brief shift in voice, clearly marked. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "realized") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent, favoring elevated register ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic," "methodical soul") that reads voice-motivated for a lyric frame. However, perceptual signature is generic—sensory details (cold air, faint hum, dim light) could belong to any careful observer. The dweller's interior texture does not shift under the emotional arc; phrases like "their kindly heart full" feel externally imposed rather than emerging from the character's particular way of thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a meditative, nature-infused texture ("weathered hands," "tendrils reaching out"). The phrase "circuitously sincere" recurs but reads as authorial label rather than Mara's organic self-perception. Under peak pressure, diction remains controlled—"she laughed softly, the sound mingling with the storm's roar"—but the internal monologue ("to study plant behaviors," she whispered) feels expository rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final summary pulls back when dramatization would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is evident in phrases like "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe," and the voice modulates appropriately between restless night search and reflective studio return. The old woman's single line of dialogue ("You've found it" / "It's time for the exchange") carries appropriate weight but minimal subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tapestry of parched lands," "defied geometry," "haggard awe of a world reborn") that reads more authorial than character-particular for an insomniac painter, though the effect remains mostly legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated mystical register ("testament to the steadily unpredictable nature of existence") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The prose carries a uniform rhythm without stress-driven modulation. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices "shimmering," "pulsing," "glowing" without idiosyncratic filter or bias.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated texture ("navigated absences," "reactively visionary") appropriate to an archivist-protagonist. The woman's brief dialogue feels purposeful and distinct. However, phrases like "her mind already weaving the fragment into the larger tapestry" and "felt a shift—a presence, a voice" rely on filter verbs and summary interiority rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrative stance occasionally drifts toward explaining Elara's role rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and Elara's perceptual signature (analytical-artistic blending) colors descriptions ("analytically artistic," "parsing the clues while her artistic side marveled"). Register remains consistent, though some phrases drift into stock fantasy idiom ("starlit vault," "fortress of unspoken truths," "trembling certainty"). Diction under peak stress (hesitation at the pedestal) compresses slightly but stays voice-coherent. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction stays consistent (slightly elevated, mythic-tinged). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in catalog fashion (journals, star charts, ivy, constellations) without character-specific bias. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt an inexplicable pull," "felt drawn," "felt herself being pulled"), dulling immediacy. Sentence stems repeat ("She was known," "She realized," "She saw"), and the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is stable, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a controlled register ("hushed thunder," "watercolors on wet paper"). Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon throughout. Minor slip: "Its surface pulsed with a faint, magnetic hum, drawing his gaze like a moth to flame" leans on stock metaphor. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; under peak stress, diction compresses appropriately without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Clara's interiority. Voice carries some texture ("a flaw in an otherwise perfect scheme," "deathly vitality"), and the two brief dialogue exchanges feel natural and goal-driven. However, stock filter verbs and repetitive interiority stems ("She knew," "She felt," "Clara realized") accumulate, and narrative distance occasionally shifts to explain rather than inhabit. Father's brief lines are distinct, but the piece leans on summary ("his words sharp and calculated") rather than showing through speech patterns. Psychic distance is mostly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with consistent narrative distance. Diction is elevated ("gilded-leaf stationer," "fluorescent lamp," "incandescent restraint") and occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("blooming labyrinth," "veil between times") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. Perceptual signature is generic—"heart raced," "mind already turning"—without idiosyncratic texture. No dialogue present to evaluate. Sentence rhythm is uniform, missing modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("their breath mingling with the salt-laden air," "a symphony of lives intertwined"), fitting a textural/accumulative design. However, perceptual signature is generic: the wanderer notices via stock poetic phrasing rather than character-specific bias. Elision of the wanderer's backstory (how they became a death-certificate error survivor, what memories they've lost) is purposeful but never dramatized as a cost affecting present action. Voice modulates little under the container discovery's ostensible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV distance and voice remain stable; perceptual signature (drawn to "resonant hum," brushing the shell, echoing the grandfather) is character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, and diction stays within Mara's plausible lexicon. However, the peak beat—"she understood: the ephemeral compass wasn't a map but a state of being"—slips into expository summary that explicates rather than dramatizes the insight. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (urgent playing, breath catching, bittersweet smile) without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction remains consistent within Lira's register. However, interiority leans on summary ("she felt a pull," "her motivation burned brighter") rather than specific perceptual signature, and the ending shifts into collective "they" without a clean focalization handoff. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Voice is serviceable but lacks rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and professional ("lunar regolith," "chemical composition"), fitting Elara's role. Perceptual signature (headlamp, scanner, camera drone) is consistent. Internal voice defaults to stock phrases ("heart quickened," "lump formed") under pressure rather than idiosyncratic perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent; narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge without omniscient leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close (her fingers hovering, listening to light) and slightly elevated (the depot "alive with murmur"). Narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge, and her perceptual signature (air shifts, light through water) is distinct. Diction occasionally drifts into lyric register ("her soul woven into every piece," "chains groaning under the weight of destiny") that reads more writerly than character-grounded, but the effect supports the Accumulative mode and does not obscure causality. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent with a cartographer's observational idiom ("dog-eared," "coordinates," "tributaries branching out in perfect symmetry"). Under stress, however, the prose does not compress or intensify—sentences in the discovery beat remain measured and explanatory. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("felt a faint vibration," "noticed something unusual"). The phrasebook dialogue with self ("She added one more, in her own hand, the language of the river itself") feels expository rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable without head-hopping, and narrative distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and syntax are generic ("faint scent of pine," "enigmatic," "wild hush") without character-specific filtering. Psychic distance never modulates; the narration maintains uniform elevation throughout, neither tightening under pressure nor reflecting Elias's particular way of noticing. No dialogue present to evaluate. Prose reads as competent but undistinguished, with recurring template openings ("His presence was," "It was as if").

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in third limited, but narrative distance wavers between close interiority and detached summary. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("lonesome splendor," "harness the ephemeral," "transcended time and space") that feels imported rather than character-particular. The piece uses heavy filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "could feel") in peak moments, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic—Maya notices what the plot requires rather than filtering detail through a marine biologist's priorities or urgencies.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent but leans on elevated, abstract diction ("impossibilities," "thread the labyrinth," "chasing hush") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, though interiority defaults to summary and philosophical reflection. Psychic distance remains stable, but the narration withholds practical facts (why imprisoned? who will find the bodies?) for manufactured suspense. Perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing does not reflect a distinct mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, diction elevated and gothic ("petrified blossoms," "ephemeral cameo appearances"). Perceptual signature is atmospheric but not character-specific; the ghost bride's way of noticing (spectral, mournful) does not constrain knowledge or reveal a distinct bias. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") appear but remain voice-consistent. No head-hopping or tense drift. The prose reads competent and legible, but rhythmic control under pressure is absent—peak beats (paragraph four, kneeling) lack syntactic acceleration or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but diction drifts into elevated register ("perpetual cycle of creation and reverence," "timeless narrative") that exceeds the scene's immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices "whispers," "remnants," "relics" without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. Elision is purposeful (the mechanics of sewing are compressed), but the prose never anchors perception in her body or tool-handling to create a distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (tracing patterns, listening to whispers) but the diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with immediate perception under pressure ("fractured by centuries of displacement," "beacon guiding her toward a future rooted in the past"). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Lyra's focus on codes and cryptic details. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "relentless pursuit of meaning") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Lyra's internal voice lacks distinct texture under pressure, reading as polished exposition rather than lived urgency. No dialogue appears to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the flame observation, pulled back for Lira's exposition). Dialogue ("I've come to synchronize") carries slight stiltedness—"through adjacent possibilities" and "disguised their wisdom as foolishness" echo prompt language more than naturalistic speech under stress. Internal voice shows some specificity ("galaxy-chart embroiderer" framing her perception) but "her resolve hardening" is a stock interiority phrase. The prose avoids major filter-verb stacks, and the perceptual signature (craft-focused, star-attuned) is present if not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent perceptual signature ("skin prickled," "breath caught"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("suffocating and protective," "precipice of an unspoken apology") that reads slightly external to the moment. Filter verbs ("realized," "knew," "felt") cluster in the final third without voice motivation. No dialogue present. The internal voice remains coherent but leans on declarative certainty ("Elara knew its true power") where inference or doubt would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("mist-clad," "lotus-hearted ache," "threshold") and maintains internal consistency. However, perceptual signature is generic—word choice (jasmine, condensation, marble) could belong to any contemplative narrator. The metaphor density ("shield too thin," "threads of language," "beacon of hope") approaches ornamental in high-pressure beats without a taught pattern. Elision of the decryption mechanics is purposeful compression, acceptable under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV narration is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in visual and light-focused description ("luminescent pigments," "glowing creation"). The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction during reflection ("pensive mirth," "fluid within the fold of a daydream") that feels slightly above Lira's embodied state. Purposeful compression in the time passage ("Hours passed, or perhaps only moments") fits the daydream frame but is not paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV narration remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on color, vibration, and movement, fitting a restorer's professional lens. Dialogue from the coin-figure and obsidian-eyed woman carries subtext ("what if the lost seeks to restore you?") and distinct idiom (harmonics-inflected phrasing). However, interiority occasionally slips into generic intensity markers ("her breath catching," "heart raced") without character-specific texture. The prose modulates appropriately from methodical opening to lyric climax ("conducting, as if she were shaping the air itself"), maintaining voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and Elias's perceptual filter (noticing carvings, shadows) is consistent. Dialogue between Elias and Krane carries light subtext ("You're not as stealthy as you think"), but both speak in similarly articulate, quip-ready registers without distinct idiom. Diction stays within a literary-adventure register, though occasional stock phrases ("his charm kicking in") flatten voice. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage mar the text.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person close, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. However, the diction drifts into prompt-adjacent phrasing ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy," "centuries of longing") that reads as ornamental rather than voice-particular. Perceptual signature is weak—the poet's way of noticing does not feel selective or character-specific, and interiority relies on abstract claims rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated poeticism ("luminous floor," "shards of moonlight," "river of centuries") that risks register drift from the caretaker's perspective. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than character-specific filtering—"her heart quickened" and "overwhelming" are stock emotional markers. Elara's narration remains distant and decorative; no micro-modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature (linguist, sensitive to voices and scripts) colors narration appropriately. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("arcane linguist," "symphonies of truth," "tapestry of truth") that flattens urgency. The final dialogue exchange is competent but generic ("you've always been reckless, but today you were careful too"). Interior access remains consistent and no head-hopping occurs. Rhythm modulates adequately but lacks a distinct syntactic fingerprint under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable (third-limited on Elias) with no head-hopping. Diction includes some specificity ("brass links glinting," "interlocking with the next"), but the narrative voice drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to a time when gods and mortals might have shared the same stage") that does not reflect a machinist's perceptual signature. Psychic distance fluctuates without purpose: "his resolve dappled with doubt and hope" reads literary rather than embodied. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are sparse and acceptable. The phrase "slyly heartfelt" appears once as a descriptor of the poem, not as a trait shaping Elias's speech or choice rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, though narrative certainty sometimes exceeds what Elara can plausibly know ("their patterns now seeming deliberate, as if guided by an unseen hand"). Diction leans elevated ("extraterrestrial origin," "symphony of blooming and withering") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is moot. Perceptual signature is generic—dust motes, skylight, pigeons—without idiosyncratic filtering that reveals how this mind notices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization. Diction is elevated and lyric ("featherly determined," "fractured hush"), establishing a distinct texture. However, register drifts into abstraction under pressure ("strange kind of closure," "quiet clarity") rather than remaining character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, and the voice modulates with the terrace's shifting atmosphere, but peaks lack rhythmic tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature tied to Elara's astrologer lens ("patterns on the walls like stars trapped in a jar," fireflies "like distant constellations"). Psychic distance modulates effectively (close during firefly communion, pulling back at alarm urgency). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis immediacy: "softly ingenious precision," "shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite" feel authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The phrase "captivate the moment" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly performative. Free indirect style is clean, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent focalization through Lira's lens. Diction is voice-appropriate—"sea-foam recollectionist," "transliterates emotions"—and the narrative register remains elevated without major register drift. Perceptual signature is present: Lira notices "faint, swirling patterns" and feels a "strange pull." Minor slip: "cheerful gloom" and "embrace" (final paragraph, likely "an embrace") show light copy errors. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose texture supports the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice remains stable in third-person limited with consistent diction ("calculated wilderness," "lightly attentive gaze"). However, the narration frequently drifts into elevated philosophizing ("maestro of the unexpected," "testament to the power") that sits uneasily with street-performer POV and reads as authorial intrusion. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Perceptual signature is asserted ("his lightly attentive eyes scanning") but not demonstrated through selective, character-specific noticing—Elias observes generically rather than through a distinct filter.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction carries an elevated, lyric register ("shadows stretched like whispers," "obsidian grace"). However, distance wavers: we remain outside Lira's embodied experience at key moments (trembling, spinning, closing eyes) without access to the sensory or emotional texture driving those gestures. The sentinel remains faceless and voiceless, offering no dialogue to test subtext or goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a consistent reflective register. Elias's perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, light-focused) is clear and character-specific. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated, quasi-lyrical diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "threshold," "weaver of stories") that reads more like authorial commentary than the glazier's interior idiom. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "knew") are frequent but do not obscure immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and controlled, though occasionally lapses into abstraction ("hard softness," "enlighten himself") that feels concept-driven rather than character-particular. No dialogue to judge. The perceptual signature is present but muted by the reflection-heavy mode; Elias's way of noticing remains generic rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful," "the harmony of the design itself"), creating a distinct lyric texture. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara filters setting through abstraction and pattern—though it never degrades under stress. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") are purposeful and sparse. The prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Her motivation was clear") and abstract philosophizing, but voice remains coherent and the register matches the contemplative focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("ivy-veiled," "serpent," "her sensitively perceptive nature") leans elevated and occasionally generic ("the faint hum of history, the sigh of forgotten stories"), but voice is consistent and legible. Free indirect style is clean; perceptual filtering is reliable. No dialogue present to assess, and the prose remains functional without a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("perceptively calm," "dusky harmony"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract declaration ("her art was not just illusion; it was empathy") that tells rather than embodies. The phrase "borrowed heartbeat" recurs but lacks concrete perceptual signature—what does lending one's pulse feel like? Filter verbs ("She knew," "She watched") are sparse, and the prose maintains a lyric texture, but the voice does not modulate under pressure: Elara's interior remains equally poised whether singing or sacrificing. No dialogue appears, so that bullet does not apply. The final paragraph's summary mode ("her work would endure") softens immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Narrative distance and perceptual filter are consistent, reflecting Elara's mission-focused attention. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate, though some phrases ("operatively gentle," "slow dance of celestial bodies") repeat without evolving meaning. The leaders' dialogue is absent—their climactic moment occurs in silence and gesture, which is a purposeful choice but limits opportunity for subtext and voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited and the perceptual filter (wide-brimmed hat, faint prints) reflects Elara's purposeful movement. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fractured grace," "fragment of her own lost humanity") that clashes with on-page action. The narrator withholds Elara's full plan ("preservation—a secret she guarded fiercely") for manufactured suspense, then reveals it in exposition rather than through dramatized choice. Syntax is clean but rhythmically uniform across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance and narrative stance are consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with immediacy: "paradox," "eloquent," "reckoning," "unshakable," "conduit," all deployed in high-pressure beats without irony or voice-motivated texture. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; she notices starlight and snow but her internal idiom lacks specificity. The prose reads competent but committee-like, lacking a distinct rhythm or lexical bias tied to her occupation or history. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("urbane calligrapher," "meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") in ways that feel more authorial than character-particular, though it remains legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently but stay voice-motivated. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is present (tracing stick patterns, noticing dome's echoes) but not sharply character-specific; the voice could belong to many reflective protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric-philosophical voice ("esoteric realist," "blushing stillness"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though some phrases ("transiently rooted," "interrupted cadence") feel purpose-built for the prompt rather than organically character-particular. No dialogue to judge. Perceptual signature is present (sensing unseen things, listening to secrets) but does not vary under pressure—tone remains meditative throughout. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction often drifts into elevated, essay-like register ("bordered on prayer," "inextricable from the thematic question") that reads more as narrator commentary than Elara's perceptual signature. Psychic distance widens during atmospheric exposition, then tightens briefly for action, without clear purpose. Elara's "quiet resolve" and "technical gentleness" are told, not shown through syntax or selective perception. No purposeful elision or compression; the prose explains rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: diction ("ethereal grit," "abiding connection," "collective unconscious") drifts into elevated register that does not feel character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "seemed") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation. The prose reads more like curated atmosphere than a singular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the prose lacks perceptual signature—no astronomer-specific noticing or professional idiom colors the narration. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony," "essence of unwavering commitment") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Internal thought is expository and label-driven ("deep-seated belief," "insatiable curiosity") without rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with one brief focalization shift to Kael's memory. Dialogue carries subtext in places ("That thing's broken. Just like everything else") but defaults to articulate exchange even under stated emotional pressure. Diction drifts into abstraction ("scheming mind already at work," "weaving through the labyrinth of his memories") that feels more authorial than character-particular. The phrase "her scheming nature giving way to genuine compassion" tells rather than shows the shift, flattening Elara's voice at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent—"ethereal beauty," "otherworldly energy," "swirling patterns of light"—but the register tilts toward generic fantasy-prose without a perceptual signature specific to a mirror maker's craft or sensory bias. The stranger's single line of dialogue ("What do you see?") and Elara's reply carry minimal subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "seemed to shift") cluster without voice motivation. "Her hands moved without her conscious direction" externalizes agency at a peak beat, undermining POV intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—quartz eyes catching light, attention to the ribbon—but diction drifts into elevated register ("verdant sanctuary," "testament to nature's reclaiming") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("She realized," "She thought") are frequent but not excessive. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (whispered "Persist"), and the prose has a distinct lyric texture. Under peak pressure (final transformation), syntax remains controlled with no major lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"bewildered curator," "brightened disquiet," "web of possibilities"—but the register feels generic literary rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature is faint; her way of noticing does not distinguish her from a template narrator. The woman's dialogue ("A keeper of stories") and Elara's replies are formal and thesis-adjacent, lacking subtext or idiomatic friction. Psychic distance remains steady, but voice lacks specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through Elara. Register occasionally drifts ("arcane linguist with a reputation for being carefully resourceful" reads like prompt exposition rather than lived perception). Dialogue is minimal; Kael's single line carries urgency but no subtext. Perceptual signature is generic (fingers brushing spines, mind racing) without character-specific bias. "Carefully resourceful nature" is told three times without distinct syntactic embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Elara as the sole focalizer. Diction ("hazy embrace," "unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant") is consistent but leans ornate, occasionally drifting toward elevated register ("testament to the blissfully aberrant lives"). No head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts. The voice is coherent and purposeful, though the reliance on stock phrases ("trapped freedom," "tangled narrative threads") and the final summary paragraph weaken specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single stable POV with consistent third-limited distance. Diction leans elevated ("testament to centuries of craftsmanship," "sanctuary of understanding") and carries a uniform register across calm and high-pressure moments, lacking perceptual signature under stress. No dialogue appears. The narrative certainty is high throughout—Elara "knew the key lay" and "realized the seal's symbols matched"—projecting mastery rather than inference. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose remains uniformly declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the ice-crack reading and the echo chamber stone's pulse, grounding the narration in Lira's method. However, diction drifts into elevated register at emotional peaks—"her spirit light," "timeless song," "hammered repose"—that reads generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; the syntax remains steady whether Lira kneels by ice or conjures the bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent (scholarly, archival focus). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("retrocognitively blessed," "thistle-blown hope") that feels ornamental rather than rooted in the custodian's working idiom. The phrase "thistle-blown hope" in particular reads as an imposed descriptor rather than emerging from the character's lived experience or crisis perception. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, and internal thought formatting is clean, supporting the mid-6 placement.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored in Elara's perceptions and reflections. The prose carries a lyric, slightly elevated register—"deliberate grace," "eerie glow," "chorus of forgotten stories"—that fits the archival, mythic tone. However, the voice occasionally tilts toward expository summary: "Her motivation was clear: to sculpt identity from experience" and "She was preemptively nostalgic, always looking back even as she moved forward" read as author explanation rather than dramatized through choice. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she noticed," "she knew") are present but not excessive. The final paragraph's repetition of thematic language ("listen, to remember, to sculpt identity from experience") feels programmatic rather than organically compressed by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is consistent. Diction ("testament to resilience," "mosaic waiting to be completed," "declaration, a promise") skews elevated and generic, lacking Lira's occupational idiom as a fireworks designer. Chants are mentioned but never quoted or embodied in rhythm. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is thin—"her fingers brushing the rag knot"—but the piece avoids head-hopping and maintains voice coherence across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV is stable with clear focalization through Elara. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, though occasionally elevated ("celestial tapestry," "metamorphosis as inevitable as the cicada's emergence") in ways that edge toward generic lyricism. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present—"warmly observant" colors her noticing—but under peak stress the prose remains meditative rather than compressing or fragmenting. No dialogue; the Kael relationship is referenced but not enacted. Interiority stays character-particular without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance and a perceptual signature rooted in Elara's claustrophobia and longing. Diction is largely character-appropriate, though phrases like "intangibly tangible freedom" and "gilded hush" occasionally drift into elevated register. No dialogue appears; interior voice is clear and purposeful, with acceptable filter verbs ("she imagined," "she knew") that fit the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV held cleanly through Elias's perspective. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a calm, measured rhythm that mirrors Elias's mission. Dialogue feels natural and advances the thematic inquiry without exposition. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated—Elias's way of noticing leans on the vial more than idiosyncratic bias. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt") appear frequently but do not obscure immediacy. Voice is competent and legible, though not memorably distinct. Sentence structure varies purposefully, supporting the vaulting hush tone.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Lira with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable, lacking perceptual signature or rhythmic distinctness. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bioluminescent vines," "resonant hum") that feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose functions cleanly but without character-specific texture or modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scars as tethers, breath synchronization) and the narration stays within Lira's knowledge frame. However, diction drifts toward elevated abstraction under peak pressure ("suffocating presence," "loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper" repeated) instead of compressing into character-specific perception. Filter verbs ("could feel," "knew") stack in high-stress lines without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Narrative distance is consistent, and focalization holds to Elara's knowledge, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—diction and rhythm do not shift under the pressure of the portal crossing or chamber activation. Phrases like "shadowseam wonder," "virtuously mischievous spirit," and "crystallized promise" read as authorial labels rather than character-particular thought. The future-self's dialogue ("Now take this knowledge back") is generic, and Elara's internal voice does not deepen or compress under climactic stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Eleanor's perceptual signature (tracing carvings, feeling weight as promise, eyes snapping open) is consistent and anchored in her grandfather's legacy. Narrative distance is controlled, and psychic access stays within her knowledge. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that reads imposed rather than Eleanor-specific: "eloquently silent," "standing waves of sound her grandfather had once described" feels more thematic shorthand than her lived idiom under pressure. The shadowfigure's dialogue ("You've come") is functional but generic. No other character speaks, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through Alaric. Diction is elevated and rhythmic ("shivering bliss," "seeping into his skin like a tattoo"), matching the mystical greenhouse tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—Alaric notices patterns, weight, warmth—but interiority occasionally slips into prompt-echo phrasing ("murmured allegiance," "shape of possibility"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the ending, though some filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (archival lens, dust-reading, emotional investment in files) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sanctuary of unknown histories," "shimmer, as if approving") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Interior voice leans on summary and filter verbs ("she realized," "she imagined," "she felt") where free indirect style could sharpen immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is consistent but not tightly calibrated to emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and Mara's perceptual filter is consistent (mission-focused, resourceful). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("auric," "suffixed humanity's spirit," "tyranny of indifference") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Interior access is shallow, relying on summary ("her heart pounding," "her mind raced") rather than specific, character-particular texture. The prose modulates little under peak stress; Mara's thought at the climax ("she did what she did best—she adapted") is generic and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and diction is elevated but consistent throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic—the saxophonist's way of noticing (luminescent moss, swirling mist) could belong to any character; no idiosyncratic filter or bias shapes what he sees. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Dialogue is absent (correctly, per the Global Dialogue Policy). Prose rhythm is competent but uniform; no modulation under stress distinguishes peak moments from setup.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register with purposeful diction ("ashen skyborne arbor," "hush where past meets prophecy") that fits the mythic-folkloric tone. POV distance is stable throughout, with clean third-person limited focalization and no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into summary-tell ("She was not just a seed sorter; she was a guardian") and the final paragraph's articulation of theme borders on over-explanation. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific; the attention to seeds, leaves, and dust remains descriptive rather than revealing Elara's unique way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to the tinkerer's perceptions. Voice carries consistent texture through selective detail ("labyrinth of gears, springs, and half-finished contraptions") and perceptual filters (the compass "humming softly," the earth "whispering its approval"). However, at peak moments the prose shifts into abstraction ("inexplicable pull," "uncertainly certain purpose") and therapeutic phrasing ("befriended uncertainty") that dilute immediacy. The stranger's cryptic line and the tinkerer's reflective passages are cleanly formatted, but the voice lacks distinct rhythm or idiom that would elevate it beyond competent neutral narration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in alchemical diction ("factually mystical blend," "luminous regret") but remains consistent rather than modulating under pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster in the vision sequence and dull immediacy. The narrative voice leans toward elevated register ("redemption, she believed, came by exploring limits") that reads more like thesis than lived thought, though it stays consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is controlled and distinct ("luminous ache," "guttural echo"). The figure's direct speech—"Why do you pursue me?"—carries goal and vulnerability. Elara's perceptual signature leans toward the poetic but stays consistent. Minor slips: "modestly fearless" and "purposeful effect" read as authorial labels rather than embodied stance, and some filter verbs ("felt the ache") dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and poetic ("symphony of ultraviolet penance"), fitting the displaced-rooted tone, though occasional phrases ("byproduct of the experiments," "recalibrated to survive") drift toward clinical register outside the character's immediate emotional state. No dialogue is present. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices light, texture, energy—but the vocabulary remains uniformly abstract under pressure rather than compressing or fragmenting as stress rises.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Lila notices "whispers," "shadows that danced like ghosts," "the weight of untold stories"—elevated diction that fits a translator role but lacks idiosyncratic texture. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The prose modulates slightly with emotional beats (quickening heart, tightening fingers) without dramatic shifts under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Marcus's perceptual signature (elevator tech habits applied to dust, "methodical approach") is specific, and his interiority anchors each beat. Distance modulates purposefully: close during the barrel lift and ceiling climb, wider during the opening exposition. However, several lines drift into elevated diction not fully earned by his voice ("coalescing," "gravitational force," "nascent expanse," "chorus of relief and gratitude"). The fluorescent-buzz frame and the sawdust/popcorn scent anchor voice in concrete detail, but the "weightless burden" refrain and "fabric of the room" phrasing read slightly generic. No dialogue present to test subtext or character distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "seemed") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited perspective with elevated diction appropriate to the fantastical setting. However, filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood," "she realized") accumulate in key beats, dulling immediacy. The narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—phrases like "the whisper spoke of rustling awakenings" and "the fabric of reality" could belong to any voice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable, and there is no head-hopping, but the voice lacks distinctiveness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("baroque," "burnished sorrow," "ethereal radiance") in ways that strain naturalism but remain internally consistent. Filter-verb density is moderate. No dialogue appears on the page, so subtext and character-voice distinction are not tested. The perceptual signature lacks idiosyncratic bias—Elara's noticing reads generic-scholarly rather than character-specific. Register stays consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Voice leans into elevated fantasy register ("gravel and sorrow," "cascading through the chamber like a waterfall of stars") that reads generic rather than character-particular. The stranger's single line of dialogue carries archaic weight but no subtext or evasion. Psychic distance stays consistent. Filter verbs ("felt alive," "understood") appear at key beats, dulling immediacy. No perceptual signature distinct to a repairman's trained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent aesthetic register (sensibly eccentric collector voice, sensory focus). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "petrichor," "psychometry reading," "resonant hush" fit the character's idiom. Perceptual signature is consistent (scent-first noticing, vial-clinking tactility). However, several constructions drift toward elevated abstraction under pressure: "delve deeper than the earth allows," "where reality bent and time folded," "something infinite"—register mismatches that reduce voice specificity at closure beats. No dialogue is present. Focalization remains clean with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is apt for the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weakly established—driftwood sculptor details appear only in the opening. The single line of dialogue ("Reimagine") is tagged as "her mantra" rather than emerging organically. Diction occasionally inflates ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances") beyond the grounded sculptor voice set up initially. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she realized") cluster in expository beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature (artist's attention to light, color, texture) is consistent. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but leans on stock intensifiers ("heart full," "quiet drive"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between reflection and observation, maintaining clarity without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice carries a distinct elevated register ("searing reverie," "dark whisper across the sands") that suits the archivist focalizer. Single exchange of dialogue at the climax is goal-driven and advances plot cleanly. Perceptual signature leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("echoes of voices long silenced," "tapestry she was desperate to weave whole") which, while consistent, border on stock phrasing in the high-pressure beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance remains controlled. The figure's voice ("its tone neither hostile nor welcoming, but heavy with the weight of centuries") edges toward portentous cliché but remains functional.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with stable psychic distance. Diction remains within Elara's register, though it drifts toward elevated abstraction in peak beats ("conceived a future," "power of creation"). No head-hopping or POV leakage. However, the prose lacks perceptual signature; observations feel generic rather than character-specific, and the narrative texture does not shift under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") are frequent but voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices linguistic symbols, ancient tongues) but could be sharper under pressure. Diction is controlled and genre-appropriate, though some phrases ("velvet disquiet," "her heart quickened") read as stock. The phonograph dialogue/recording is handled cleanly, and internal thought is formatted consistently. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the decipherment sequence. One minor slip: "her fingers brushing" and "she decided to immerse herself" lean slightly tell-heavy, yet the voice remains coherent and the final moment ("I remember," she said) is purposefully simple and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean with no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—elevated but not jarringly academic—and perceptual filtering is steady. However, the voice lacks a distinct textural signature: phrases like "her heart pounding yet strangely at peace" and "the texture of borrowed time—smooth yet fragile, like the surface of a still pond" read as generic lyricism. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. Psychic distance is appropriate but the prose does not modulate with pressure in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable and distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices air pressure, rope texture, hum resonance—filtered through his occupation and passion. However, the prose slips into elevated register at peak moments ("as if time itself were slowing," "a testament to the power of listening") that reads more writerly than character-particular. Diction like "credibly curious" and "conceptual repricing" feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is controlled but the voice lacks the grounded idiom that would distinguish it from generic literary narration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness," "eternal canvas") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular for a cosmic janitor. Perceptual signature is generic; Lira's way of noticing doesn't reflect occupational bias or personal history. The prose maintains clarity but lacks rhythmic variation under pressure—syntax remains uniform across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Elias throughout, with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a decades-long recluse's likely lexicon: "mute eloquence," "tranquilly perceptive," "inexplicable pull," "profound sense of peace." Perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices "the way the light filtered" and "faint hum of bees long gone" without character-specific bias or selectivity that would distinguish his noticing from a catalog. Psychic distance remains stable but lacks modulation under pressure; the ritual's peak reads at the same remove as earlier exposition. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is generic: "strange warmth," "profound sense of purpose," "sense of belonging" repeat therapy-adjacent phrasing without character-specific idiom. Dialogue between Elara and Thaddeus ("Where did you find this?" / "She explained her discovery") reads as functional exchange without subtext or goal-driven evasion. Diction stays consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—peak beats (device activation) maintain the same measured cadence as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person POV is stable and filters perception through the poet's warmly attentive stance. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("burnished hush," "harmonized discord"), establishing a lyric register that matches the protagonist's occupation. Dialogue feels slightly formal but carries subtext in the wanderer's pauses and the poet's gentle challenge. The prose occasionally drifts into exposition ("Her method was unique: she harmonized discord…") that tells rather than shows, and some filter verbs ("she noticed," "she examined") dull immediacy in peak discovery beats. No head-hopping or tense slips; voice is consistent but edges toward a generic literary smoothness rather than a character-particular perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Elias throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and rhythm stay uniform across calm and discovery beats without modulating under pressure. Filter verbs ("he noticed," "he felt," "he knew") appear frequently but read functional rather than voice-contaminant. The prose tilts toward elevated register ("testament to harmony," "chorus of voices") that feels imported rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and moderately literary ("bronze quiet," "luminous skeptic"), though some register elevation ("existential," "paradoxical blend") feels imposed rather than voice-motivated under Elara's supposed skepticism. Perceptual signature is present but generic—her way of noticing does not reveal character-specific biases or blind spots. The prose modulates appropriately across beats (ascent, encounter, chamber, descent) without syntactic monotony, yet lacks a distinct rhythmic texture that would elevate it into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature: diction is elevated and literary throughout ("shrouded in twilight's embrace," "narrow vastness") without modulating under pressure or reflecting character-particular filters. Sentence rhythms are syntactically varied but tonally uniform. The coachman's "ancient" perspective is asserted but not enacted through specific idiom, bias, or selective attention. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, and the opening line ("a retired bloodhound named Elias shuffled") anchors voice and stakes effectively. Diction remains controlled—"the wasteland had a way of pulling him back into its mysteries"—and psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (close during the phonograph sequence, pulling back for the final walk). However, Lira's dialogue ("They say you used to find things no one else could") and Elias's reply ("It said we're not as far apart as we think") lack subtext or character-specific idiom; both voices converge into serviceable exposition. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("wild hush of the factory") that feels imported rather than Elias-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("monument to humanity's fleeting grasp of eternity") that reads generic rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's noticing lacks selective bias. Sentence stems repeat across paragraphs ("Each stroke," "Each line," "It was as if"), creating template cadence that flattens voice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, anchored to Kael's perception. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like "sacredly playful nature" and "cautious abandon" feel abstract and register-drifted. The narrative voice remains consistent, with purposeful modulation during the chess match: "his heart raced as he approached the board." No dialogue appears, so distinction tests do not apply. The prose maintains clarity and distance without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Voice texture is elevated but generic: "weight of forgotten conversations," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence" read as thesaurus selections rather than character-specific diction. Kael's dialogue ("A game without pawns…") feels expository. The prose maintains distance control and no head-hopping occurs. Register remains consistent if somewhat overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature ("fluid as her name suggested," "mercury-glass seer") establishes a distinct register. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("harmony of her fragmented self," "catalyst, forcing her to confront") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The narrative withholds Elara's nightly reality-substitution mechanics without dramatizing the elision's purpose, creating orientation debt rather than earned mystery. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose lacks embodied specificity under pressure, defaulting to poetic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature is present in Elara's chess-tutor lens (tracing grooves, "move on a chessboard"), though under-exploited. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fierce repose," "woven hush") that feels more authorial than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in several beats without voice motivation, and the final paragraph's tense of resolved calm lacks the syntactic compression that pressure would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows Lira filtering the canyon through metaphor ("skeletal fingers," "mirror," "altar"), though this texture remains consistent rather than modulating under peak stress. The poetry fragments carry distinct diction ("soft lilt," raw/unpolished), but peak interiority defaults to elevated register: "the price of forgiveness, she understood, was not something she could pay with words or actions alone." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the spire glow sequence. No dialogue is present to judge. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "realized then") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not stack to dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is moderately distinct (charm-focused attention, metaphor-laden interiority). Diction stays within register except for occasional elevated abstractions ("dire enchantment," "quilts memories together" as verb). Rhythm modulates adequately between calm examination and shuddering urgency. The voice reads competent but not character-particular enough to charge peak beats; interiority under stress relies on generic bodily clichés (trembling hands, pounding heart, deep breaths) rather than idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but generic; perceptual signature is weak ("the waves whispered secrets," "fleeting dance of light and shadow"). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The prose carries a uniform elevated register that does not modulate under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in Elias's close third throughout. Diction is mostly character-appropriate, though phrases like "screaming tenderness" and "vibrations of intent" drift toward elevated abstraction. The woman's dialogue ("Whispers travel farther than shouts") is on-the-nose and lacks subtext. Perceptual signature is present (the scent, the hum of the cork) but flattens under peak moments when embodied detail would sharpen pressure. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual filter stays within Mara's access throughout. However, diction drifts toward elevated abstraction in key beats ("the geography of loss," "the depths of the human heart") that sits uneasily with the scavenger-builder role. Dialogue from the traveler is brief and functional. Under peak pressure (building the device, adjusting it), the prose remains externalized description rather than tightening into embodied perception or rhythm that reflects urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited focalization through Elias, and the prose maintains appropriate distance. Mara's brief dialogue carries distinct hesitance and reverence. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured grace," "occlude his control") that reads more authorial than character-particular for a truffle forager, especially under stress. The Latin recitation is voice-appropriate for the ritual moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices gaps, imprints, scent traces) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("witnessed isolation," "softly persistent reminder") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The "strange sense of peace" at closure is asserted rather than shown through embodied perception, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a solitary dealer's immediacy: "empirically intuitive," "lingering promise," "weight of centuries." The cloaked figure's dialogue ("The doorway of decisions has been waiting for you") reads as prompt-language rather than embodied speech. Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices what the plot requires (ants, crack, symbols) without character-specific bias or professional filter shaping his attention.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and no head-hopping occurs. The queen's perceptual filter (focused on the grotto's glow, the dreams) remains consistent. However, the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature; diction in peak beats ("lacy menace," "bleeding starlight") leans toward elevated register that reads more as authorial decoration than the queen's urgent interiority. Dialogue with the starlight figure is minimal and functional but carries little subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Diction elevates into abstraction ("scientifically romantic pursuit," "palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity") that clashes with the concrete action layer, creating register drift in peak beats. Dialogue serves exposition ("I've been working on something—a way to revalue what we think we know") rather than pursuit or evasion. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not feel character-specific. Sentence openings vary, but rhythmic control does not modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single first-person-limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "fingers brushing against eternity") that is consistent but edges toward elevated diction not fully rooted in the focalizer's lived idiom under stress. Dialogue, when present, functions to deliver theme ("Why do you envy us?") rather than advancing goal-driven subtext. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; the scroll's "markings resolved into a language she didn't recognize but somehow understood" is convenience rather than character-particular cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (Elara's heightened non-olfactory senses) is present but not deployed under peak pressure—her "closing her eyes" moment tells rather than shows sensory compensation through concrete, character-specific detail. Dialogue between Elara and Mira is functional and advances plot, but both speak in similarly elevated register ("testament to the quiet strength," "miracles were in the ordinary"), reducing voice distinction. Diction remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks or register drift, keeping the piece in solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (breath, heartbeat, old tales) shapes narrative texture. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("saturated hush," "crow quill trimmed tip"), with purposeful elevation that matches her scholarly idiom. The single line of dialogue ("Not again") lands naturally and advances plot by externalizing her internal struggle. Minor slips: "the story she was still writing" in the final stretch drifts toward meta-commentary, and a few filter constructions ("felt a sense of peace") slightly dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV distance is stable; voice carries a lyric register ("whispered secrets of centuries past," "ethereal grit"). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so the dialogue policy does not apply. Elara's perceptual signature (tracing ridges, feeling currents) is consistent, though diction occasionally elevates into detached narration ("the hush before the orchard's trees were cut down") where her urgency would compress syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the witness throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the mythic register ("resounding hush," "universe's hiccup," "frayed threads of existence"). However, the prose lacks a perceptual signature specific to the witness; descriptions feel authorial rather than filtered through character-particular bias. Under peak moments (mural encounter, dictionary glow), the syntax does not modulate or compress to reflect urgency—emotional intensity remains uniformly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the prose carries a meditative, slightly elevated register consistent with Elias's philosophical focus. However, interiority leans on filter constructions ("his mind racing," "his heart pounded") and some diction ("eminently peculiar," "fjord quiet") feels externally imposed rather than character-specific. No head-hopping; the voice maintains coherence across beats. The perceptual signature is generic (squinting, clutching) rather than distinctly Elias's way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Elara's perceptual signature (focus on patterns, light, fragility) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sanctuary of quiet contemplation," "clover melancholy") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate to 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Eli's perceptual signature (the disc "shimmering," his drumming fingers, his unease) is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the callers' repetitions and Eli's final "It's me" carry subtext and goal. The prose modulates from detached observation to urgent interiority as pressure rises. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual filter (walnut ink, proximate causes, "gently thorough"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("haunted euphoria," "the weight of small moments") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Mara's brief dialogue is functional and naturalistic. The prose maintains distance and voice through turns, with no head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the polite anarchy of a life lived with hope and connection") that does not match the focalizer's in-scene texture. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices in broadly literary terms rather than through disaster-logistics professional bias. The single line of dialogue from an alternate self feels expository. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack without voice motivation in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and the perceptual signature (vibrations, absorbed languages as "whispers") is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("a quiet blaze of determination," "liquid silence," "frequencies beyond human hearing") without grounding in Elara's tactile, blind mapmaker voice. Free indirect access is clean, but the prose converges toward generic lyricism at peak beats rather than tightening around her specific way of sensing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices the pen's glint, hears the hum) and diction stays consistent. However, during peak pressure inside the void, the voice shifts into elevated register ("kaleidoscope of possibility," "coalescing into a coherent whole") that reads writerly rather than character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent—close enough for interiority ("She thought of the people she'd advised") yet maintaining slight elevation for lyric cadence. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("luminous," "bittersweet expression," "tapestry of emotion") that feels more authorial than character-specific, though it reads as intentional voice choice for accumulative/textural mode. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's way of noticing (moonlight, camera gleam, water prisms) lacks character-particular bias and could belong to any observer in this setting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "their mind already piecing together the puzzle" tells rather than shows the analytical process. Diction remains serviceable but textureless—no distinct rhythm or vocabulary tied to this focalizer. "Volcanic tenderness" is asserted twice but never embodied in syntax or perception under pressure. Orientation debt from Q2 applies the 7.8 cap per global cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance oscillates: paragraph three offers expository backstory ("The treatment had been sold to her..."), then paragraph four returns to immediate perception. Vocabulary remains consistent to the lyric register, though phrases like "auroral sorrow" and "hush of the universe inhaling" feel ornamental rather than character-specific. The drumming habit is mentioned but not woven into sentence rhythm or diction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with good perceptual control: "whose job was to ensure the pathways remained navigable," "Eli realized." Diction is consistent and clean, avoiding filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Mira's "Prove it" drives the beat. However, sentences share template stems ("The labyrinth seemed," "The key... felt," "The map was"), and the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure—interior texture remains neutral rather than character-particular. No mid-paragraph head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spiralingly calm demeanor," "stillwater tension") that reads more authorial than character-rooted. The guardian's perceptual signature—stillness, mirror-work, shutter adjustment—is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the stranger's single question and the guardian's silence carry subtext but do not advance plot through pursuit or evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register inconsistent with tight focalization: "the hush where past meets prophecy," "magnetic grotto under starlight," "forests of second thoughts." These phrases read as authorial rather than character-particular perception. Psychic distance is inconsistent—sometimes close ("his eyes scanning"), sometimes externalized summary ("As the days passed, Elias worked tirelessly"). No dialogue appears to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance control is clean. Perceptual signature is present in the opening ("ocean's breath whispered secrets," "calloused hands") and the scrimshaw's "strange warmth." Diction remains consistent, though the climactic beat dips into abstraction ("detach—from her fears, her doubts") that sits uneasily against the prior sensory texture. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance modulates intentionally from close (touch, sight) to reflective at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent formal register ("as if the structure itself resisted," "a microcosm of her inner world"). Internal monologue is concrete at the whittling beat ("The knife cuts, the wood yields") but drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a metaphor for her own existence"). No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present (blank face, "remade hush") but flattens under emotional pressure into stock phrasing ("quiet rebellion stirred," "quiet resolve hardened"). Filter verbs ("seemed to echo," "felt like a taunt") dilute immediacy in multiple lines.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. However, diction drifts into elevated literary register ("lantern-moth hush," "cobalt atrium," "tremor of certainty") that feels authorial rather than emerging from a distinct character consciousness. The poet's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic filtering or bias shapes what is noticed. Voice lacks specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective (grays/whites on palette, rustling plants, metallic hum) and voice-motivated. Distance control is mostly clean, though occasional phrases ("innocently cunning, a trait that allowed him") read as narrator summary rather than Elias's lived perception. The glassblower's dialogue ("You've captured it. Not the colors, but the essence") feels slightly on-the-nose, articulating theme rather than pursuing a goal. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("symphony of grays," "fabric of life," "his secret language") that sits uneasily alongside concrete craft detail.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is auditory-focused and consistent (Elara notices sounds, light, and texture). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions during peak beats ("duality of progress," "erosion of human connection") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. The prose carries a distinct lyric rhythm, but Elara's interior voice converges with the narrator's thematic voice in the final third, reducing specificity. Filter verbs ("realized," "felt," "wondered") cluster without purpose-driven urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in "hollow," "deft and sure" becoming "subdued ardor," and the observatory as "timeless." Diction is controlled, though some phrases—"curtains of intention," "genuinely artificial"—read as authorial concepts rather than fully naturalized through Elara's idiom. The phrase "curtains of intention…imbued with the intentions of those who had passed through" is expository scaffolding mid-scene. Under peak stress (the tattoo transfer), the prose remains measured and observational rather than compressing into her immediate embodied state, which slightly dulls the intimacy expected at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register with strong atmospheric texture ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "rain tapped...like distant Morse code"). Elara's perceptual signature is distinct (seeing patterns, measuring the intangible) and the focalization remains stable throughout. Dialogue between Elara and Mira is minimal but functional ("I need to confide," "You're not just reading the past...you're rewriting it"). The psychic distance is controlled, though some filter verbs appear ("wondered," "realized") that could be more immediate. No head-hopping or POV leakage detected.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent elevated register—"atoms of nostalgia," "fragile threads of her own sanity"—that fits a historian's voice. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, the diction leans ornate throughout ("tantalizingly out of reach," "gateway to a future") without modulating under pressure, and some phrases ("the very atoms of nostalgia were alive") drift toward abstraction. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; the filter feels authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("softly deliberate," "labyrinthine archives," "ethereal light"), though it leans toward lyric generality rather than character-specific perception. Filter verbs ("felt a surge," "realized," "believed") cluster in key beats, softening immediacy. The prose has texture, but under pressure the voice does not compress or sharpen—syntax and rhythm remain uniform. Perceptual signature is present (dusk, twilight, forgotten corners) but not distinct enough to feel inevitable to this narrator alone.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.6)
    The POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("profound sense of peace," "enduring power of hope and resilience") that sit uneasily alongside concrete wildlife-handler idiom. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's way of noticing does not reflect occupational bias or character-specific priorities. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks texture and modulates little under emotional pressure, reading more like narrated summary than lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara "gazes," "traces," "feels warmth," without character-particular idiom. Diction drifts into prompt-language ("closure seeker," "displaced miracle," "meteor hush") that sits outside the narrative voice. The plants' telepathic voice ("Tunnel. Follow the tunnel.") is the only dialogue-like moment, and it reads functional rather than embodied. Psychic distance remains consistent but uninflected; no compression or modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is consistent and controlled with a lyric, slightly elevated register ("each step a whisper of history," "hushed thunder"). POV is stable third-limited with appropriate narrative distance. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("quiet energy," "intangible landscapes") that distances the reader from Elara's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue present to evaluate. The psychometry reading sequence maintains focus, but the prose does not degrade or sharpen under stress—Elara's perception remains steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the diction ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture") creates a consistent lyric texture. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, repeated stock phrases ("her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration," "something just out of reach") and elevated register ("the essence of creativity, scattered across the universe") flatten the narrator's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears to assess. The voice reads competent but not distinct under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction trends toward generic fantasy register ("otherworldly light," "fractured lullaby," "vast cavern") that lacks character-particular texture. Perceptual signature is absent: Mara's way of noticing reads interchangeable rather than selective or biased. Filter verbs appear occasionally but not excessively. The prose maintains clarity and grammatical control, but voice does not modulate with emotional intensity or reveal a distinct rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-limited POV with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Eamon's noticing reads generically philosophical rather than character-particular. Diction drifts into elevated register ("mosaic of experiences and truths," "wild frontier") that feels authorial rather than rooted in a stray philosopher's idiom. The summary mode ("he began to explore with renewed purpose") replaces scene pressure with distant recap.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinct rhythmic control ("shoreline lullaby," "gauzy light," "serpentine path"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the ferryman's lines carry subtext and world-weary wisdom. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the weight of their footsteps in the air," "imprint itself on her being") that flattens immediacy under pressure. POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope"), though phrases like "unpardonable silence" and "the cost of safety" border on prompt-label repetition rather than organic perception. Filter verbs ("he noticed," "he saw") appear frequently but fit the contemplative voice. Perceptual signature is present (silence as story-carrier, tactile focus on the bolt), yet emotional peaks rely on abstract claims ("surge of energy," "courage to hope") instead of concrete sensory breakdown. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance remains controlled; the narrator's lexicon stays within educated, reflective register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable. Psychic distance is consistent but generic—perceptual signature is absent (Elara notices "dust," "stones," "constellations" without character-specific bias). Dialogue appears only in the climax; the pretender's "You think you can unmask me?" and Elara's "I don't think, I know" sound interchangeable and thesis-driven. Prose rhythm is uniform; no modulation under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV interiority is controlled and lexicon stays consistent (marine biologist register). The reflective mode is sustained without head-hopping. However, psychic distance flattens under what should be peak curiosity—"her curiosity grew, a quiet insistence" tells rather than enacts perception. Elara's voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; her noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to judge. Clean mechanics and stable tense.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (stargazer focus, opera-glass frame) but diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats: "a margin of illumination," "thunderous serenity," "the stubborn refusal to let hope die." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "not as a lost soul, but as a spark ready to reignite the flame" reads as retrospective narration rather than immediate perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is stable third-limited on Mara, and perceptual filters (plants "whispering," the embryo's pulse) are consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "exulted," "verdant light," "destiny finally unsealed" clash with the established voice. The guard's single line of dialogue is functional but generic. Mara's interior certainty ("she knew," "she felt") flattens dramatic tension by removing ambiguity. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, filtering setting and memory through Zara's trauma-marked perception. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional register drift ("somatic markers—a survival mechanism honed by years of trauma") reads clinical rather than character-particular. The narrative distance handles reflection competently, but peak moments rely on stock embodiment ("her heart slow, her muscles tense") and the final smile feels like authorial positioning rather than an earned perceptual signature shift.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's interiority dominates. Diction favors elevated metaphor ("luminescent," "spectral presence," "tapestry") that occasionally drifts from immediate embodiment but remains consistent as lyric voice. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during card-handling and reflection. The rhetorical questions feel purposeful rather than filter clutter. However, register remains uniformly poetic without modulation under peak pressure, and some constructions ("the ache remained, but it was no longer a burden") lean toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (pale skin glowing, eyes scanning with "consciously wild intensity") is consistent. The woman's dialogue carries a distinct weariness and calm authority. However, several lines drift into writerly elevation ("Time itself seemed to bend," "a testament to the power of understanding over control") that exceed Elara's in-scene cognition. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the closure image, and the woman's lines occasionally tip into expository service.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, the prose voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-particular, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the dizzying quiet settling around her like a shroud"). Interior thought is often summarized ("her mind reeling from the implications") rather than rendered through specific perception. The single line of dialogue ("Contraband truths") functions more as thematic echo than goal-driven speech, and it doesn't distinguish her voice or advance the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elara's perceptual frame. Diction remains consistent with her contemplative voice ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") though some phrases approach purple ("tranquil blaze of color and hope"). Dialogue is functional but generic; Kael's speech lacks distinct idiom. The filter phrase "her senses on high alert" dulls immediacy in a tense beat. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent lyric texture ("silence had a voice," "symphony of silence"). Dialogue with the goddess feels stylized but goal-driven. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: Kael's way of noticing reads as authorial landscape rather than fisher-inflected observation, and the diction ("transliterated," "ethereal," "feral lullaby") drifts into elevated register without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Eleanor's perceptual filter ("devotedly observant") colors descriptions. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("orbits of regret," "solemn playfulness giving way to grim determination") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. The director's dialogue is summarized rather than dramatized, denying us the subtext and goal pursuit that would test Eleanor's resolve. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the lack of interior contradiction under pressure flattens the voice during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance is controlled. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("a meteor hush—a stillness so profound it felt sacred") that feels authorial rather than Elara's interior idiom. The firmware's "language of broken code" and "cries translating anguish" are vivid but border on metaphor-convenience. No dialogue appears (none required). Perceptual signature is present (amber fixation, constellation focus) but voice does not modulate sharply under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("felt like a dagger," "seemed to glow") cluster without clear voice motivation. Clean execution with minor register slips keeps this in low-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited holds consistently with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly stable, though "lilac unease" and "emergent hush" repeat as unearned abstractions. The perceptual signature—whimsical, socially attuned—is declared but not enacted through selective, biased noticing. Purposeful elision is minimal; the vision sequence is clear. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is controlled. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and consistent perceptual anchoring (Elara's retrocognitive drift, her hands on the mosaic). Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("aberrant mercy," "cradling empathy in arms of steel") that reads prompt-adjacent rather than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (tessera, mosaic, wind). Voice is competent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or sentence rhythm that differentiates Elara's interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Mara's perceptual signature ("synesthetic currents," colors as emotion) is consistently foregrounded, and the narration filters setting through her theatrical lens. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "the threads of possibility that hung by a thread" (redundant metaphor), "intertwine the past and the future," and "rising nostalgia wash over her" read as thematic placeholders rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue between Mara and the woman ("You're not alone," "How…?" "By producing echoes") lacks subtext or resistance; lines advance exposition rather than pursuit of conflicting goals. The final paragraph's "bittersweet smile" and "rising nostalgia" are label-only emotional closures.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("ethereal hum," "willowglass hope," "fractally precise"), but elevated phrasing often floats above embodied perception: "somatic markers of intuition and memory" and "visual exploration of the pathways" read more like thematic shorthand than Elara's lived texture under stress. Perceptual signature is underdeveloped; the geode and studio are described generically rather than filtered through her artist's priorities. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter reflects Elara's professional focus on sensory mapping. Diction is consistent, though phrases like "factually mystical" and "voice of the unknown" (repeated thrice) edge toward elevated register without character-specific idiom. Free indirect passages are clean. Minor deduction for reliance on filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") in peak emotional beats that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("deliberate grace," "quietly inspired," "unearthed silence") that reads as generic lyric rather than Elara-specific perception. Distance is stable, but diction drifts into workshop abstractions ("shared wisdom," "raw possibility") that lack character grounding. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed to resonate," "felt a surge of connection") dull immediacy in key beats. Perceptual signature is absent—Elara's way of noticing is interchangeable with a neutral narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("silver hush," "veil," "courage felt buried") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("prudently daring exploits," "vouchsafe her life") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains steady; filter verbs ("felt," "realized") are acceptable within the lyric mode but do not vary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; the coachman's perceptual signature (ambient awareness, listening to the world) is consistent. Diction leans elevated ("percolate through the air," "spindrift serenity") but remains coherent within the contemplative register. Dialogue between coachman and figure feels ritualistic and thematic rather than naturalistic, but it suits the tone. Filter verbs ("could feel the weight of their gaze") slightly dull immediacy at the key encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping; Elara's perceptual signature (noticing light patterns, pottery shapes echoing hives) is consistent. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional phrases drift into abstraction ("zen-minded," "sharp gentleness," "the power of understanding and connection") that feel imposed rather than filtered through her artisan's sensibility. No dialogue appears, so voice is evaluated through narration alone. Psychic distance narrows appropriately when Elara holds the glass and broadens for the summary time-skip in the final section. Register remains stable except for one intrusion: "fractured timelines were not a curse but a testament" reads more authorial than character-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV anchors to Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature reflects her gardener's attention (leaves swaying, petals, soil) and the lockmaster's maritime approach. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt") appear but remain voice-legible. Dialogue carries subtext (his observation about instilling life, her question "after the final petal drops") and distinguishes the two speakers by idiom and rhythm. Brief elision of the lockmaster's backstory is acceptable at this length. Minor slips: "wistfully pragmatic" and "protected vulnerability" are asserted traits rather than enacted through syntax or diction under pressure, and the final paragraph shifts toward summary distance ("she knew") instead of maintaining immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elena, but psychic distance fluctuates—"she understood now" and "she was no longer just a guardian" read as external summary rather than interior realization. Diction drifts into elevated, semi-abstract register ("atomically reflective," "brittle awakenings," "harmonious melody," "embodiment") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she felt a surge," "seemed to echo") without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic—Elena notices moss, clouds, and carvings, but her way of noticing does not reveal biased priorities or a distinct idiom. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices "small details" (dragonfly, sunlight through arches) consistent with her whimsical frame. However, diction drifts into elevated spiritual register ("prismatic quiet," "invisible web," "tapestry") that reads generic rather than character-specific. The narration withholds why the spiral matters to her until it's placed, a brief elision that doesn't impose later cost. Rhythm and syntax are competent but lack distinct texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual filter—astronomical charts, spectrograph—reads distinct. Dialogue with Hank is functional and goal-driven. However, narrative distance flattens under pressure: "Her years of studying celestial patterns had taught her" tells expertise rather than showing perception shaped by it. Diction remains steady, though phrases like "small bastion of human ingenuity" drift into elevated register at the ending without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("shadowed nexus," "reverberation," "wistful rebellion") appropriate to the fantasy-archaeological frame. However, the diction occasionally drifts into generic fantasy stock ("towering ruins," "otherworldly glow") without character-specific perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates appropriately at peak moments (passage squeeze, shard grasp), but the narrator's certainty about metaphysical concepts ("spatial mutiny," "rebellion against the very laws of existence") exceeds what Elara can plausibly know in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person close maintains stable distance and the diction fits Elara's artistic perspective. However, peak-stress moments default to elevated register ("jagged edges softened by the mist, its darkness pierced by a single beam") that reads more like art-catalogue prose than urgent interiority. Filter verbs ("seemed to echo," "seemed to merge") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated purpose. Perceptual signature is consistent but lacks character-specific bias beyond generic artist observation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, and Elara's perceptual signature (cataloging, deciphering, questioning logic) is present. However, psychic distance slips at closure when the narration claims "she understood the true cost of bravery" and "she had chosen wisely" without dramatizing the understanding or showing the cost. The dialogue with her great-uncle is functional but generic ("You've done it," "The choice remains"), lacking subtext or character-specific idiom. Diction is controlled but occasionally elevated ("spongey dread coiling," "unyielding") without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Bridge-Song; no head-hopping. Diction cycles through template phrases: "dynamically observant," "luminous disbelief," "scaffold wrap flutters." Perceptual signature is generic—what a fiddler notices versus what anyone would notice is indistinguishable. Psychic distance stays uniform; under urgency (the hike, the uncovering), syntax and rhythm do not tighten or compress. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance and tense hold. Elias's perceptual signature favors calm observation and puzzle-solving diction. The dialogue with the scavenger is brief and functional, carrying subtext of deference without overt conflict. Sentence rhythm varies somewhat ("His fingers traced... each bill a relic... colors vivid despite their age"). However, interior voice drifts into generic literary phrasing ("a fleeting dream," "monument to failed ambition," "invisible thread") and the final epiphany uses prompt-echo language without distinct embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. However, diction drifts into abstraction ("mender of broken narratives," "tapestry of hope") that reads above Elara's immediate lexical register under pressure. Filter verbs cluster in the final third ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is faint; her way of noticing does not carry character-specific bias or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filters sensory detail through Eira's perception (the paradoxical scent, the vortex pressing like unseen hands). Psychic distance modulates appropriately when she approaches the heart of the vortex and memories surface. The phrase "her warlike serenity belied the storm within her" and similar constructions carry a slightly elevated register that occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy toward narration-for-reader. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a semi-elevated register ("otherworldly hue," "ethereal glow") that remains consistent. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in broad strokes without idiosyncratic bias or selective attention shaped by her visionary role. Diction occasionally drifts into prompt-template phrasing ("root-bound visionary," "eclipsed covenant") without voice-motivated specificity. No dialogue appears. Under peak pressure (approaching the pedestal), syntax does not tighten or modulate; the rhythm remains uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in tight third; Elara's perceptual signature (scent of earth and decay, half-lit glow) is consistent and purposeful. Dialogue with the shadow-figure carries subtext and advances plot, though the figure's lines ("meaning is a currency") tilt toward thematic articulation rather than naturalism. Diction is controlled with occasional elevated turns ("dusky with resolve") that fit the narrative voice. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains clean focalization, though internal texture under peak stress could compress further for rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is present—Elias filters the quarry through his roadie past—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("insulating himself emotionally," "unmoored," "nascent stirrings") that doesn't fully cohere with the established voice. Psychic distance is consistent; the story stays close to Elias's interiority. No dialogue appears. The narrative texture is controlled, though some phrases ("confidently uncertain," "echo valley longing") feel imported from the prompt rather than organically voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Eliara's perceptual bias (methodical translator interpreting symbols) is present. Diction remains consistent, though phrases like "mix of fear and excitement" and "sense of completion" flatten voice into generic emotional labels. No dialogue appears; internal voice is functional but not deeply textured. The mentor's spirit appears in visions but remains a guiding presence rather than a distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance modulates appropriately (close during the pool scene, slightly wider for reflection). Perceptual signature is consistent but not strongly character-particular—diction tilts elevated ("tapestry of opposing threads," "wintersun serenity") in a way that reads more authorial than librarian-specific. No dialogue. The incantation moment ("whispered an incantation, her voice steady") is told rather than shown, missing an opportunity for voice texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric register ("resonant hush," "latent radiance," "heartbeat of a hesitation") that fits the contemplative tone. However, diction slips into elevated abstraction during peak moments ("her motivation crystallized," "a catalyst, a force that could mend") rather than remaining grounded in Elara's perceptual signature. Elara's interiority reads as thesis-driven rather than character-particular, with stock phrasing ("bridge, a conduit") that could apply to any spiritual protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but mild (e.g., "truth-seeking river chronicler" frame colors her noticing of graffiti). The acquaintance's dialogue ("Still playing the same tune?") feels generic rather than voice-distinct. Diction occasionally inflates without character justification: "daringly methodical," "raw solace," "cryptic guide" read as authorial rather than Elara's interior lexicon. Psychic distance is consistent, and no unmotivated filter verbs stack, but the voice lacks a strong rhythmic or syntactic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is competent but leans on generic fantasy register ("ethereal light," "cautious exuberance," "the journey between two fateful letters") that lacks character-specific texture. Perceptual signature is thin—descriptions could belong to any observer. The prose modulates minimally under pressure; the protagonist's voice at the desk ("words flowed from her mind") reads identical to her voice at the entrance, missing the urgency that should narrow or sharpen perception.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara, with no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture in the opening ("velvet observatory," "mulberry ache"), but diction becomes generic under pressure: "she knew what she had to do" and "that, she realized, was enough" are stock closure phrases. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") appear frequently without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's way of noticing is not character-specific. The plants' telepathic voices are indistinct from narrator summary. No dialogue is present, so dialogue bullets do not apply. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("The story was far from over") breaks the POV's immediacy and reads as authorial convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is present ("lucidly watchful," focus on patterns) but leans toward label rather than demonstrating how she notices differently under pressure. The traveler's dialogue carries subtext but slips into thesis statement ("sparks are fleeting...stillness...endures"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("threshold of stillness," "radiant hush") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. No head-hopping; brief dialogue is functional.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.9)
    Narrative distance drifts from close third to omniscient tour-guide: "as if the pin held a story she hadn't yet heard" and "It was a key, not just to this place, but to understanding the cycle of rebirth" read as authorial meta-commentary rather than Elara's perception. The moon-woman's dialogue ("You've come… It is a key") exposition-dumps rather than pursuing a goal with subtext. Diction oscillates between elevated ("umbral," "ethereal," "luminous") and generic ("quiet unrest," "heart quickened"), and the voice lacks a perceptual signature specific to a caretaker of rare plants.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elias throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("conscience for hire," "murkiest moral waters") though occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("welcome nuance into certainty"). No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. The perceptual signature is present but leans philosophical rather than character-specific; Elias's way of noticing (chimes as code, shard as metaphor) reads more like thematic annotation than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the reflective narration maintains a consistent elevated register ("the sycamore hush of the grotto," "the timeframe of her meditation stretching beyond the present"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("a confrontation, a reckoning with her own carefully woven lies") that flattens urgency in peak beats. The older-Elara dialogue ("To teach vanishing to appear…is to understand that absence is as powerful as presence") reads polished and thematic rather than spoken under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices ripple patterns and starlight—but her way of seeing does not shift under stress, and no micro-compression reflects trance intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("the art of stillness," "pulse left wandering") but operates at a uniform poetic register that never degrades under pressure or modulates with urgency. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to vibrate," "seemed to sigh") cluster in atmospheric beats without voice-driven purpose. Perceptual signature remains abstract: Kael notices patterns and rhythms but rarely anchors sensation in body or immediate texture, flattening the felt quality of the wait and the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Eli's perceptual signature shows some selectivity ("breath crystallized," "footsteps echoing") but lacks character-particular bias; the prose could describe any cautious explorer. Diction remains consistent in mid-register fantasy idiom without jarring shifts. However, filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("he felt a pull," "he felt weightless," "filling him with a sense") that dull immediacy during the harness activation and keystone touch, the story's two highest-pressure moments. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph shifts into summary reflection ("he knew he would return") that externalizes rather than inhabits the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose maintains a lyric, contemplative register throughout. Diction is character-appropriate for a lamplighter drawn to mystery. However, perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices "soft blue light" and "faint luminescence" without a distinctive way of seeing that reveals his values or blind spots. The voice is coherent but lacks the specificity that would make his focalization irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Diction is largely clean, though phrases like "wavelength align with purpose" and "stellar doubt" read as imposed prompt language rather than character-particular perception. Sentence openings show some variety, but several adjacent paragraphs begin with "Lira" or "The," creating mild rhythmic flatness. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Diction carries an elevated, mythic register ("crystallize their essence through scattered light") that fits the reaper premise but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism at peak beats, reducing embodied immediacy. Perceptual signature is present—her grief colors what she notices—but the prose does not degrade or tighten syntax under the ritual's pressure. No dialogue appears. The voice is coherent and purposeful, though it leans toward lyric declaration over character-particular idiom in the climactic naming sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; distance is consistent, filtering the viaduct and bell through Eliard's earnest lens. Diction is slightly elevated ("plausible impossibility," "melody he could almost hear") but stays within a mage-narrator's register. Purposeful compression appears in the dripping-rates method and the alloy crafting, both elided but legible. Perceptual signature is present (focus on rhythm, family memory, texture of rust) but not sharply distinct; another character might notice similarly. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("thought of," "wondered if," "felt") appear frequently but fit the reflective mode; psychic distance modulates intentionally as pressure rises toward the strike.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, but the prose drifts into elevated, quasi-lyrical register ("mirrored hush of twilight," "pinholes in a dark cloth") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Elias's perceptual signature is generic; his "vigilant" role is asserted but his way of noticing does not reflect tactical expertise or personal bias. The final lines—"spun something beautiful from the fragments of the past"—sound like thematic summary rather than his interior voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distances are consistent. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's alchemist lens ("her mind working like a puzzle solver"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("kaleidoscopic," "radiated a quiet power") that feels decorative rather than rooted in her interiority under pressure. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed") cluster in mid-pressure beats but remain voice-legible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.5)
    Generic narrative voice: "shimmered with an ethereal glow," "silent vow," "eerie silence," "newfound confidence"—stock fantasy-register diction without perceptual signature. No dialogue to test. The seeker's interiority toggles between determinations and recollections with identical syntax ("their mission was clear," "their gaze fixed," "their hands moved"). Psychic distance is stable but lacks character-particular filtering—any guardian-figure protagonist could narrate this way. Under peak pressure the prose remains tonally uniform, missing the modulation called for.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("traversed the abyss of self," "reclaim their fragmented soul") that exceed embodied urgency. Lira's dialogue ("life cannot exist without death") and Kael's interior voice sound interchangeable, lacking character-specific idiom. The perceptual signature is generic: no selective bias or quirk distinguishes Kael's way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction carries a lyric, fable-like register consistent with the haunting tone. However, the voice leans into elevated abstraction ("mournfully eager," "plea to the silence," "stitched together what had been lost") that distances the reader from Eli's immediate perception; filter verbs and summary constructions ("He knew," "seemed to") dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains constant rather than modulating with emotional intensity. The prose is legible but the perceptual signature is not character-particular—Eli's way of noticing reads as narrator's poetic stance rather than his own idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.3)
    Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction inconsistent with feral urgency ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity," "make friends with uncertainty"). The keeper's dialogue ("I am the keeper of the boundaries of light") and Elara's reply feel expository rather than goal-driven. Dialogue subtext is minimal; lines explain rather than pursue or evade. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific filtering of the garden's sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV narration is stable; POV distance and tense are consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("stoically sensitive," "the penny drop—a sudden clarity that reshaped her purpose") that feels more like external labeling than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific; the narrative voice reads competent and clear but lacks a distinct rhythmic or lexical texture that would mark it as unmistakably Elara's mind. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third limited, but distance is inconsistent: "It was said to be" (distant legend) sits beside "her heart steady" (close). Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("enigmatic," "grand symphony," "infinite potential") that does not read as Elara's interior lexicon under pressure. No distinct perceptual signature: her noticing is generic ("eerie silver light," "faint melody"). Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster without voice motivation, flattening immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("ardent," "resiliently," "kaleidoscope of colors and sounds") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Mara's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing does not reflect a deckhand's idiom or lived experience. Dialogue with the transient is functional but carries no subtext or indirection. The phrase "her consciousness splintering" tells a state that should be rendered through fragmented perception.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization on Elara. Diction remains consistent—"fever dream architect," "rational enchantment"—establishing a distinct voice, though some phrases skirt purple ("rivers of color," "symphony of rational enchantment"). The shadow-man's telepathic speech is legible and voice-motivated. Filter verbs ("She knew," "she felt") appear but don't dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present in how Elara scans and responds to the gallery's shifts, and the prose modulates with pressure without breaking register.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue pursues goals but tilts expository ("We've spent centuries learning to read the heavens"). Perceptual signature is generic ("her mind a compass needle perpetually seeking true north"). The narration drifts toward elevated diction ("somber marvel," "horizons unfolded") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Internal texture remains steady but lacks character-specific idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("reeling hush," "incidental heroism," "profound discoveries") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—she notices mist, pulses, and a photograph without idiosyncratic bias or selective attention. The whisper's fragmented speech ("Find the last photograph," "Protect her story") lacks naturalism or subtext. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose reads as neutral summary rather than a lived consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping, and the vocabulary ("claustrophobic spelunker," "liminal realm") fits an educated narrator. However, diction is inconsistent: "crashing hush" and "phase transition" feel ornamental rather than character-rooted, and "the unremembered" reads like prompt language rather than Elena's idiom. Psychic distance is mid-range throughout—no modulation under peak stress. Dr. Voss's dialogue ("The cables are more than wires…") is expository rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is generic; Elena's noticing is indistinct from a neutral camera.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third limited is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is present (breath visible, heartbeat counted) but diction frequently shifts into elevated register inconsistent with the moment: "ephemeral patterns," "defragment the data," "echo of what might have been." No dialogue to assess. The heartbeat motif is mentioned repeatedly but does not modulate with scene pressure—it "quickens," then "steadies" in summary fashion. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") appear frequently in the final third, dulling immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative voice carries a distinct elevated register ("the towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth"). However, diction at peak beats leans abstract: "a sense of accomplishment," "profound silence," "spirit unbroken" are label-only emotional claims rather than embodied perception. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a surge") cluster in high-pressure lines, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and diction carries a consistent atmospheric register ("labyrinth of shadow and scent"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Lena's interiority could belong to any researcher. The cryptid's dialogue ("the lock is within you") shifts into riddle-speak without voice distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") stack in the final paragraph, dulling immediacy at closure. No purposeful psychic distance shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's way of noticing (musician, sky-bridge dweller) colors only a few beats ("resonantly soft melody," "bow moving with steady determination"). Diction occasionally inflates: "tarnished wonder," "forgotten dream," "beacon of hope" lean toward generic lyricism rather than character-specific texture. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "began to") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. Under peak stress (statues advancing, roots erupting) the prose maintains rhythm without compression or collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, filtering through Elias's perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured skies," "ghostly echo," "brittle hush") that doesn't fully cohere with a working mailman's idiom under stress, though voice remains legible. Dialogue is minimal (one line to Luma, brief handoff to envoys) and functional. Filter verbs ("felt a strange pull," "knew this was only") appear but don't obstruct immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature (focus on mail, drone, border) is character-appropriate if not deeply distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") that fits the fairy-tale atmosphere. Diction remains within an elevated but controlled range. However, the carpenter's sudden ability to sing without dramatized interior friction—"words flowed from him"—bypasses the POV's established constraint (voice "stolen by the weight of his own memories"). Distance control is mostly clean, though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("he knew then") shifts into distant retrospective telling.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual filter (equations on napkins, scarf as talisman) is consistent. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "sanely eccentric" and "observed solitude" read slightly external. The final paragraph shifts toward summary narration ("she knew the truth") instead of holding the experiential lens. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains third-limited without head-hopping, and the narrative distance is stable. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("cipher of longing," "luminous absence," "improbable, luminous journey") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is absent—Elara notices in generic catalog fashion (colors shimmer, light dances) without bias or idiom. Filter verbs ("she noticed," "she believed," "she knew") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture ("quicksilver," "forgotten ages"), but under pressure the voice flattens into generic fantasy register without character-particular perception. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear frequently without voice motivation. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "I release you"), functional but not goal-driven or subtextual. Psychic distance remains consistent; no elision debt, but the narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV is stable; focalization remains with Elara throughout. Perceptual signature shows in "chronically curious nature" and the way she notices constellations and symbols, though diction occasionally drifts into generic register ("tales of forgotten voyages," "the truth was within her grasp"). No dialogue to assess. The prose carries a consistent folklorist-researcher texture in her noticing of patterns and symbols, and psychic distance modulates purposefully when she recalls grandmother's tales without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows some specificity (tea leaves as language, backwards walk) but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("combative tenderness," "essence of reversible exile") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Syntax is controlled but leans on repetitive participial openers ("its silence both haunting," "her words flowing like a river"). Voice reads as authorial-literary rather than distinctly Elara's mind under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are frequent but voice-motivated; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice is stable third-limited but relies on recycled poetic diction ("radiant hush," "verdant parapet," "insatiably creative") that flattens Elara's perceptual signature. Filter verbs and passive observation dominate peak beats ("she felt," "she knew," "she imagined") where direct perception would sharpen pressure. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the narrator's lexicon drifts toward elevated register ("ethereal," "succor," "continuity") without grounding in Elara's internal idiom or the immediate sensory moment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person close on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest"), though some phrasing borders on elevated abstraction ("restless spirits," "communion"). Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices texture, resistance, whispers—but under peak stress (stubborn knot) the voice remains steady rather than compressing or degrading. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, and the narrative stance modulates with emotional intensity (opening calm → deepening pressure → final stillness). Minor register drift into abstraction ("profound stillness," "restless energy") at closure slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, but the narrative voice relies on elevated, abstract diction that does not track a map framer's professional perceptual signature: "methodically curious," "shielded openness," "the weight of the chapel's absence." Filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "seemed to hold its breath," "seemed to glow") stack across high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Elara's interiority alternates between poetic abstraction and label-only emotion ("her heart heavy with reverence") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice. The voice reads as a committee consensus rather than a singular, character-particular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Elara's analytic filter shapes what she notices (meticulous handwriting, frayed ropes, smeared ink). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful elevated register ("sophisticated melancholy," "labyrinth of unfinished narratives") that fits a marine archaeologist's interior texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance remains steady. The only slip is mild lexical formality in peak beats that slightly distances emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature ("driftingly alert") anchors the voice. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous figure, both ethereal and solid"). However, several lines tip into over-written register: "tinkersong wonder," "stardust on the wind," and "a tapestry of symbols and sigils" feel decorative rather than voice-specific. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear at key moments, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is present—goggles amplify light, breath visible in cold—but diction lacks character-specific texture; phrases like "her resolve strengthening" and "her heart alight" read generic rather than voice-particular. No dialogue appears (appropriately, given solitary journey). Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under rising stakes; each floor receives similar syntactic treatment regardless of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable; third-limited stays with Elara throughout. Diction is consistently elevated and poetic, matching the atmospheric intent. However, the narrative voice leans on stock lyricism: "whispers in a dream," "brushstroke of moments long past," "quietly explosive." At peak stress (the leap), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing to reflect urgency. Perceptual signature is present (clouds as emotions, scientific terms as metaphor) but the lens does not modulate under pressure. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse; internal thought formatting is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV distance is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature—"fractally precise detail"—is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to her skill and the guild's vision") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The prose modulates appropriately as pressure rises, shortening clauses during the climax, but filter verbs ("she felt," "seemed to") stack in reflective passages without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries period-appropriate diction ("*Lumen via, lux perennis*"). Psychic distance is controlled with no head-hopping. However, interiority leans toward scaffold phrasing ("her heart racing," "her breath catching," "her fingers tracing") and the single line of dialogue is a whispered epiphany rather than goal-driven exchange. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices what the plot requires without character-particular bias. Under pressure, the voice remains even rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and psychic distance remains consistent. Perceptual signature is present—"fingers brushed against spines," sensory filtering through cold and moonlight—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the very essence of time," "infinite possibilities") that feels authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. No head-hopping. The prose maintains a lyric, slightly archaic register ("hauntingly bright," "labyrinthine shelves") that coheres with the setting, though it flattens somewhat during the mirror visions, where summarized emotional states replace immediate sensory experience. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person distant POV holds stable with no head-hopping, but voice remains generic high-fantasy register without character-specific perceptual signature. Elara "glided," hope "brambling," the nebula "cascading like a waterfall of stars"—elevated diction throughout flattens urgency. No dialogue appears. The prose serves atmospheric catalog more than interiority or pressure, and the closing paragraph's "their hope no longer brambled but blooming" lapses into thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent—"bruised sky," "pane of hush," "ripple"—but leans elevated without stress modulation. Perceptual signature is light: Elara notices cracks and light, yet her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("feeling," "seeing") appear but do not dull immediacy. The phrase "whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" and "bruised awe" recur as template cadence, flattening voice under peak pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose reads more orchestrated than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("offhandedly exact," "jagged paths winding"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("indifference," "absolute") that doesn't feel rooted in Elara's lived lexicon. The nut "glowing faintly as if approving her choices" and "urging her to act" externalize agency in a way that flattens Elara's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("And it had all begun") reads like retrospective narration rather than present immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter (molecular bonds, structural harmony) is character-specific. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("symphonically attuned," "testament to the possibility of change") that reads more authorial than character-lived, especially in peak reflection. Psychic distance remains consistent but narrows into expository summary during the insight beat rather than letting perception do the work. No dialogue is present to evaluate voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent in register and distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing reads as neutral catalog rather than character-particular bias. Diction tilts elevated ("repository of narratives in flux," "quantifying absence") without grounding in her idiom or occupation. No dialogue appears to test for subtext or goal pursuit. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate under pressure; the incision scene and descent carry identical syntactic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable. Diction is elevated and consistent but trends toward generic literary register ("forgotten secrets," "wondrous and burdensome") rather than character-particular perception. No dialogue is present. Some filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") dull immediacy in peak beats. The voice remains coherent under pressure, but perceptual signature is not sharp enough to reach high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally inflates beyond Elara's interiority ("metaphorical silo," "borrowed starlight" as repeated poetic device) but remains largely consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture in rhythm and word choice. Elara's perceptual signature—her attention to celestial patterns, choral harmony, linguistic weaving—is character-specific. However, elevated register at peak beats ("harmonious choral librarian," "interspersing languages") drifts toward abstract poeticism that slightly weakens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited distance and carries a distinct lyric register ("quaking reverie," "entangled like vines"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the very fabric of reality was being rewritten") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Elara's perceptual signature—engineer's eye for fractured systems—is asserted more than demonstrated through selective, biased noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("prism-minded," "clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze"), though some phrasing ("her heart alight with a latent blaze") borders on ornamental rather than voice-specific. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices luminescence and mist but her way of noticing lacks character-particular bias. The voice reads competent but not distinct; another archivist could narrate identically.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present in phrases like "listened to the world with her hands," yet interiority relies on therapy-speak labels and stock phrasing ("her heart full") during the closure beat. No dialogue appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Alara; psychic distance is consistent. Diction carries some texture ("thoughtfully precise movements," "the air hummed faintly") but lapses into abstract register at key beats: "a chance to redefine her purpose," "the difficult was not an obstacle but a canvas." The internal monologue at closure—"not as an exile, but as a guide"—reads as summary rather than immediate thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt," "she knew") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy. Dialogue is absent so voice rests on narrative texture, which remains coherent but flattens at the climactic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature ("intuitively descriptive") attempts specificity in phrases like "shadows danced like old friends." However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under peak moments ("theatrical sincerity," "varieties of silence") that exceed the on-page action's warrant. The grandmother's dialogue is absent; Elara's whispered "To recover what is lost…" and final "Thank you" read as thematic markers rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance remains consistent but the voice lacks character-particular rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a faint lyric quality—"wildflower hush," "dappled sunlight"—but register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("interconnectedness of all things," "phenomenon the villagers believed synchronized"). The perceptual signature (olfactory) is claimed but underused; Elara's nose detects "hints of something ancient" without specificity. Diction remains consistent within the narrator's lexicon, and the closing image of intricate doodles and lighter heart maintains tonal coherence without forced resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a consistent elevated register ("whirling silence," "the planet's song"). However, diction drifts toward generic epic fantasy at pressure points—"her heart raced," "she stood in awe," "the echoes had chosen her"—without character-particular perception. Elara's way of noticing (moss-covered ship, organic patterns) is told rather than filtered through specific professional or personal bias. The narrative withholds what the symbols on the arrow tip mean until the hologram appears, a purposeful elision, but the reveal does not alter her tactics or impose cost; it simply confirms her trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual filters ("her rapidly adapting mind," "breath visible in the cool night air") establish voice. Phrases like "hazy precision" and "singular convergence" recur as thematic echoes but begin to feel decorative rather than action-driven. Diction is competent but occasionally drifts into mission-statement register ("cultivate foresight in action") that abstracts rather than grounds.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is stable and the POV remains consistently close third, but the prose often drifts into elevated, thesis-like diction ("synesthetically blessed," "oscillating repose," "embodiment of silence") that reads more like prompt fulfillment than character-specific perception. Elara's perceptual signature—seeing sound as color—is told rather than woven into her sensory experience in peak beats. Free indirect style is clean, but the vocabulary feels external rather than lived, especially in lines like "She had vowed then to prove them wrong."

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with adequate access to Elara's interiority. Perceptual signature is present (trembling hands, pounding heart) but relies on stock embodiment clichés. Diction is mostly controlled, though "avalanchingly quiet" and "thunder-echo range" feel forced. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the flute discovery, but interior voice lacks distinct rhythm or vocabulary under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with some perceptual signature (stars, lucid turbulence, cryptic habits). Diction suffers from register drift into corporate/academic phrasing ("transposed empathy," "mathematics of emotion") that does not fit the character's lexicon in peak beats. Psychic distance wobbles: "he realized" and "he understood now" are filter-heavy tell moments. Rhythmic control is adequate but repetitive sentence stems ("The workshop," "Elias") create template cadence in the middle third. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("dragonfly-wing pendant," "fade from memory to myth") is consistent but leans toward elevated fantasy register without variation under stress. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—"thoughts drifted," "mind raced"—rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the scholar's lines carry subtext but Elara's responses are passive affirmations.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with perceptual coloring ("the lie of its beauty," "a faint resonance"). Diction is consistently elevated and fits a mystic's interior lexicon. No dialogue on the page. The prose modulates from steady observation to aching realization, though phrases like "the weight of it" and "far more profound" lean toward filter-verb abstractions. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the communion beat. Elision is minimal and purposeful (the glassblower's story arrives in fragments, matching the communion's fragmented access).

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction trends elevated ("wistful," "raveling," "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") and consistent, but the register never modulates under pressure—peak moments use the same lyric distance as opening exposition. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific. Elara's way of noticing does not shift when stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("jagged teeth," "liquid light") but leans on generic fantasy diction ("quietly determined," "unyielding," "elusive"). The stranger's dialogue ("Your awakening") and Eli's acceptance lack subtext or evasion—goals are stated plainly. Perceptual signature is weak: Eli notices setting details equally whether calm or under stress, without professional blacksmith filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the sensory-map-maker lens colors some perception ("weave the sounds, smells, and sights into a mental map"). However, peak moments rely on cliché constructions ("her voice caught in her throat," "her mind raced," "settled on her shoulders") that flatten voice. The woman's dialogue is exposition rather than subtext-laden exchange. Diction occasionally drifts into prompt echo ("cyclically spontaneous," "withheld truth") without character coloring, and the final paragraph summarizes rather than embodying the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "luminescent ache" and "warmly observant" lean slightly elevated for a reticent skipper. No dialogue is present, so that bullet set is not applicable. Interior voice is consistent but lacks the perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate it; stress does not compress or alter syntax in peak beats. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") appear but are not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on the Herald with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—diction ("shadowed elation," "ethereal green") is elevated and generic rather than character-particular. The Herald's laughter recurs but never modulates under pressure in a voice-specific way; it remains a repeated gesture without embodied variation. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") cluster at key beats, dulling immediacy. The final shift to direct address ("their voices a chorus") imports exterior certainty the POV cannot plausibly access with that precision.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Kael's perceptual filter (dye master's stained hands, focus on color and light) provides some specificity. However, distance control wobbles: "It was this gift—or curse—" reads as helpful narrator rather than Kael's lived perception. Dialogue is functional but lacks distinct rhythm between Kael and the woman—both speak in measured, articulate therapy-adjacent phrasing. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs appear frequently without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction veers into elevated register ("repository of scattered dreams," "accumulation of lives, the quantified sorrow of existence") that sits uneasily with a maintenance worker's practical task. Psychic distance widens at emotional peaks into abstract philosophizing rather than tightening to embodied perception. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. The voice is consistent but lacks the particularized texture needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the prose carries a mildly lyric texture ("shrouded in an endless night," "swaddled the realm in warmth"). However, diction slips into stock fantasy register ("Her motivation burned brighter now," "her voice rising with the dawn") without character-particular idiom. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing does not shift under stress. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited remains stable and the perceptual filter is consistent ("quiet as the dust," "fragile dream"). However, diction drifts into abstract elevation under pressure: "enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradoxes," "sources of strength." Thaddeus's dialogue reads as authorial exposition rather than character-specific speech. The phrase "staying while leaving in every interaction" in paragraph four intrudes as meta-commentary without concrete anchoring, and the final paragraph's summary stance ("she felt a sense of...") tells resolution rather than showing it through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual filter (Elara's focus on growth and restoration) is consistent but not distinctive—diction and syntax are competent yet generic, lacking idiosyncratic rhythmic signature. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she wondered") appear frequently without voice motivation. Under emotional peaks (the plaque discovery), the prose remains uniform in cadence and register rather than tightening or fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization. Voice is consistent and carries a formal, slightly elevated register appropriate to the archival setting. Diction ("quartz hush," "luminous vows") is purposeful and distinct. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is professional but generic—what a records chief notices is stated rather than shown through biased selection. Under peak stress (tremor, spike), syntax does not compress or fragment; the prose remains measured. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that harm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited with clean distance control and a distinct perceptual signature (Lila reads silences, lies in a smile, the weight of the fob). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the men's speech carries menace and the fortune-teller's cryptic tone fits the setting. Minor register drift: "curiously steadfast determination" and "comforting unease" feel elevated relative to the prior texture. No head-hopping. The final paragraph shifts into a more contemplative register that fits the reflective closure but slightly dilutes the prior urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is present (aurora "seemed to dance just for her," scent shifts noted through her focus). The cloaked figure's dialogue ("blend of echoes and whispers") strains for effect but remains grammatical. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. No major violations, but the prose lacks a distinctive rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("charcoal-fingered," mnemonic recall of every stroke) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("auroral sorrow," "rectification") that feels authorial rather than character-voiced under peak pressure. The phrase "the auroral sorrow of one who has finally faced the truth" in the climactic painting description exemplifies this register mismatch. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (noticing script, tracing lines, absorbing words) is present. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the weight of silence," "seeds of truth") that feels slightly elevated beyond lived experience. No dialogue appears. The voice is controlled but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntactic signature that would mark it as Elara's particular way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent—close enough to track Elara's beliefs, distant enough to aestheticize the scene. Diction slips into elevated register ("cerulean expanse," "ethereal glow") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Sentence openings vary, but rhythm does not modulate with pressure because no pressure appears.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with Elara's android perspective filtering sensory detail ("sensors detecting," "circuits hummed"). "Unnecessary breath" and "soft, strangely organic light" provide character-specific perception. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("nostalgic programming kicked in, flooding her with memories") that feels more authorial than android-particular. The perceptual signature is present but could sharpen under peak pressure; the miniaturization sequence maintains voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent but generic; Clara's curatorial expertise never colors her perceptions or diction. Mrs. Ellis's dialogue reads expository ("That mailbox has been here longer than anyone can remember. It's said to hold letters...") rather than goal-driven or evasive. The prose carries minimal perceptual signature—"heart quickened," "emotion swirling"—without character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and a consistent elevated register, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and imagery (e.g., "breadcrumbs in a forest," "beacon in the darkness") read as generic rather than filtered through Elara's specific expertise or worldview. No dialogue appears. Elara's interior access is shallow; we are told her feelings ("trembling," "surge of triumph") rather than shown contradictory thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but relies on stock poetic phrasing ("gleaming silence," "fragments of light," "mysteries of the universe"). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic; Eli's way of noticing does not carry character-specific bias. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is controlled within Elara's perceptual frame. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during key beats ("terrestrially cosmic origin," "smoothing the hush," "tranquil blaze") that feel prompt-imposed rather than character-particular. The narration occasionally explains what has just been shown: "She felt a profound sense of peace, knowing she had averted a catastrophe" summarizes rather than trusts the prior image. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Clara's cautious curiosity. Elias's dialogue carries distinct enigmatic cadence ("By borrowing sugar") and voice separation is adequate. However, his exposition often reads as thesis delivery rather than organic speech under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose remains clear. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts; diction fits the contemplative tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated, lyrical register ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "velvet garden") that fits the fairy-tale atmosphere. However, the diction often drifts into generic poetic stock ("achingly familiar," "pierced her heart," "promise of new beginnings") and the figure's dialogue reads as authorial thesis rather than character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster heavily in paragraphs one and two without clear voice motivation, dulling immediacy at the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated, contemplative register ("hushed embrace," "pearl twilight," "crystalline teeth") that fits the sanctuary setting and Elara's reflective task. Psychic distance is managed cleanly, with interior access ("she closed her eyes," "felt a weight lift") and filtered perception. However, diction occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing ("calibrated treason," "wisely enduring") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately at the climax (shorter beats as the thorn moves), and the final image reclaims the aurora motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("richly perceptive," "reed-blown melancholy," "serpentine nexus") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The figure's dialogue blends "countless others" yet remains generic ("born of memory," "forged in fires of desire"). Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing does not distinguish her from a generic quester. Distance is consistent but lacks purposeful modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistent third-limited focalization and an elevated register ("hushed stillness," "boundary between living and dead blurred like the edges of a dream") that suits the atmospheric aims. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock phrases ("her heart quickened," "eyes snapped open," "tremor in her chest") and therapy-speak ("weave truth carefully"). No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is present but generic (candles, ice, visions) rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or POV leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated, contemplative register ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") that fits the philosopher character, and perceptual filtering is present (fireflies "seemed to whisper," moon paths as "invisible rivers"). However, diction drifts into abstract, almost purple phrasing ("symphony of effort and beauty") and some filter verbs ("she believed," "she imagined") slightly dull immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled but the prose reads more like external description of Elara's thoughts than lived interiority under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is stable third-limited with consistent past tense. Diction is elevated ("convergence of energy," "testament to human ingenuity") and sometimes clashes with urgency ("sharply observant nature kicked into overdrive"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs cluster in key beats ("felt a faint hum," "told her," "knew the stillpoint"), dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates (close during activation, wider for visions). Diction leans elevated ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy," "variant allegiance") and occasionally slips into prompt-adjacent phrasing that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Filter verbs ("believed it was," "felt himself being pulled") dull immediacy in peak beats. Perceptual signature is generic visionary rather than character-specific—Elias notices in broad strokes (clouds, light, symbols) without idiosyncratic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping; distance is stable. Perceptual signature shows Elias filtering setting through craft metaphor ("vessel," "sweetening"), a character-specific lens. Register slips into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("lonesome splendor," "wistful nature," "gleaned redemption") that feel authorial rather than voice-emergent. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are moot. Diction remains largely consistent, but the reliance on stock poetic phrasing ("shimmering," "whispered secrets") flattens the voice's distinctiveness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    Narrative distance is stable, and POV remains with Elara throughout. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fleshly and ethereal," "logically emotional," "vibrational disharmony") that clashes with urgent action beats, flattening immediacy. The figure's dialogue ("The world is out of tune") is stilted and expository. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices what the plot requires rather than what an engineer under stress would prioritize. No distinct rhythm emerges under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited distance is stable, but the prose leans toward explanatory summary ("Her motivation was clear," "she understood") rather than embodied perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("unyoke the chaos," "internalize the lessons") that feels imposed rather than organic to the narrator's texture. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing is not character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited on Elara. Diction carries some atmosphere—"fortified vulnerability," "reverberation of the truth"—but leans toward elevated register that occasionally feels imposed rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Internal voice is consistent but occasionally slips into abstract claims ("entangled memories became her weapon") that read thematic rather than perceptual. The lantern's anthropomorphic flicker ("as if it too had been waiting") softens distance without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance is close and consistent. Perceptual signature is contemplative and chaplain-appropriate (folded hands, "aptly deliberate," quiet resolve). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Elias's explanation is compressed and goal-driven, Alistair's lines carry subtext and aphoristic weight. Alistair's voice risks slipping into wisdom-dispenser archetype ("By the way light breaks through storm clouds…"), and both speakers employ slightly elevated diction that converges under pressure rather than differentiating. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("thought of," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy significantly. Diction is consistent within the POV's reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with apt lexicon ("irreverently in awe," "microcosm of evolution"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Days turned into weeks as Lira worked tirelessly") and declarative register ("The workshop seemed to hold its breath"). Perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific; under peak stress (bell manifestation) the narration remains external and declarative rather than compressing into Lira's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent third-limited with appropriate filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt"). However, the perceptual signature is generic: Elara's professional lens as "memory keeper" does not shape what she notices or values in character-specific ways. Diction remains neutral and unvaried under pressure—"Her heart raced" and "her mind racing" are stock embodiments. The Dr. Mara audio-file exposition ("The numbers are coordinates...") carries plot efficiently but lacks subtext or indirection; it tells what the story needs rather than what the character would say mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narration stays within Elara's knowledge. Psychic distance is controlled, though elevated diction ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "courageous anomaly") occasionally drifts into abstract register that feels more prompt-derived than character-specific. Sentence rhythm varies adequately. Elision at the reconstitution beat ("drawn by an unseen force") reads as purposeful compression but lacks embodied perception of how Elara experiences the assembly. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a distinct, slightly formal texture that supports the mythic tone, earning low-6s for clean execution with minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and literary: "fold in patience," "windborne solace," "gripping reality loosely." Dialogue between Elara and the man carries subtext about mortality, and Mara's closing line feels purposeful. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to resilience," "eerie glow of the northern lights") that flattens urgency. Internal voice is consistent but leans toward reflective summary over embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Diction carries a literary-romantic register ("sentinel," "intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") that reads slightly elevated for the interiority of a vineyard worker in crisis, though it remains legible. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she thought," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages without obscuring immediacy. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic; the piece does not exploit idiom or micro-choices under pressure to sharpen voice distinction, holding it in the solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register. However, diction often drifts into ornamental abstraction ("whisperfield calm," "echo of wisdom," "symphony of voices") that flattens urgency. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing. The prophet's single line of dialogue is serviceable but indistinct. Under pressure, syntax does not tighten or fragment; the voice remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (archival focus, dove gray map case as "extension of her being") is established. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("earnest whimsy of her task," "testament to time's relentless march") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "felt like a balm") stack in mid-pressure beats without adding immediacy. Internal voice lacks distinct texture; her thoughts read as thematic summary rather than urgent perception.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent with a scholarly focalizer, though some phrases ("suspended hush," "mausoleum of forgotten texts") read slightly generic-literary. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully as dawn light enters. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-specific; phrases like "the weight of unspoken words" feel stock rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is poetic and controlled ("prism for the future," "tidal longing," "vibration of a string plucked long ago") with a consistent lyric register. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("clinging to echoes of conversations he'd never had") that tells rather than enacts the narrator's perceptual signature. Elias's way of noticing is metaphorically consistent but not character-specific—any melancholy wanderer could perceive this way. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance and focalization remain clean. The perceptual signature is present in phrases like "luminous ache" and "whisper so faint it could have been imagined," lending the narration a distinct texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("manifestation of escape velocity," "ephemeral without freezing it") that feels more conceptual than character-filtered. Under peak pressure—the all-night creation sequence—the voice compresses into summary rather than maintaining rhythmic control through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; perceptual details (scent, light, air) reflect her professional and personal lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pulsing stillness," "hymning the mundane") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is brief and functional; the narrative voice is competent but lacks a rhythmic signature that modulates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent distance. Voice carries some specificity ("spoons bent reality," "sealed awakenings"), but under pressure the prose flattens into summary ("she felt a surge of energy," "watched in awe"). Perceptual signature is present (runes "like echoes of a forgotten song") yet not character-particular enough to distinguish Elara's noticing from generic scholarly observation. No dialogue to evaluate. Peak beats rely on filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") that dull immediacy when a more embodied register would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction is often poetic ("cleft in certainty," "spun silver," "fragment of moon") but leans toward elevated register that occasionally feels like authorial voice rather than character-specific perception. The fountain woman's dialogue is formal and expository. Elara's interior texture is present but smooths under pressure—no perceptual degradation or embodied contradiction in the peak moment of the stone drop.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a lyric, meditative texture ("mist clung to the air like a whisper," "pearl of stillness"). Psychic distance is consistent, filtering all perception through Lira's reverence for light and craft. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"zephyr bloom of her spirit"—that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. No dialogue is present; interiority is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara; distance is consistent. Dialogue ("I saw your confession," "We all need something to hold onto") is functional but trends toward thematic statement rather than subtext-driven action. Elara's perceptual signature (scanning for beauty in decay) is established early but flattens under pressure—her interior voice does not degrade or sharpen when Kai appears. The prose relies on elevated diction ("burgeoning greenery," "delicate latticework") that fits the lyric mode but occasionally drifts from Elara's embodied experience into atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a lyric distance appropriate to the accumulative design. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo appearance") that reads slightly outside immediate perception. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is controlled with a consistent lyric register ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush"). However, interiority relies on stock constructions ("heart swelled," "deep sense of peace") and the narrative certainty never modulates under pressure—Elara's perceptions remain smoothly confident throughout. The prose has texture but lacks the perceptual signature and rhythmic variation under stress required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature, however, is generic fantasy-register rather than character-particular: "otherworldly light," "moving stillness," "quiet triumph." Diction is uniform across emotional states without rhythmic modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") and abstract descriptors ("unwavering patience," "paradoxical energy") replace embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("peripherally focused," "reverse-engineering," "store wonder in the cellar of reason") mixes register: technical locksmith language, poetic abstraction, and philosophical framing coexist without clear perceptual signature that unifies them as Elias's specific idiom. Perceptual selection (gears, reflections, angles) aligns with occupation, but interior voice ("felt closer than ever," "imagined filling jars") flattens into generic longing rather than character-particular syntax or rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains consistent, though elevated ("the whispers of the past and future converged") during peak beats where compression might anchor more urgently in body and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("fractal weaver," "whalebone reverie," "mosaic of constellations") that supports the mythic tone. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue serves thematic inquiry and the figure's lines carry subtext ("Purpose can be a trap"). Yet several phrases ("as if it were made of smoke rather than flesh," "radiating a presence") rely on filter constructions that slightly dull immediacy. The prose remains legible but the perceptual signature is abstract rather than character-particular; under peak pressure, the voice does not modulate or compress in a way that reflects Elara's specific mind.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Elara's perceptions. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful modulation (the kettle's sharp whistle against "rust-hued peace"). Perceptual signature is present: she notices tool precision, the grain's stories, steam distorting light. Minor deduction: some phrasing edges toward elevated register that feels slightly external to a widow in a loft ("hauntingly practical arrangement," "crystallized time"), and a few filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to say") slightly dull immediacy in peak carving moments.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric distance with purposeful compression ("chronologically confused mind," "fractured stillness"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she closed her eyes, letting") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. The camera wheel's voice—*"Don't let it end here"*—is clearly attributed and distinct from Mara's interiority, preventing head-hopping. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("envelop," "syncing with her thoughts") without POV strain, and the perceptual signature (fragment collection, overheard whispers) remains selective and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is stable and literary ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions frozen in time") with consistent psychic distance. Some diction leans elevated ("relentless pursuit of hope," "testament to human ambition") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("began to notice," "felt a stoic wonder") are present but not obtrusive, and the perceptual signature remains coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and Elara's perceptual signature (gentle precision, attunement to silence and whispers). Diction remains within her lexicon throughout. However, some phrasing drifts toward elevated lyricism ("glacial hush that cradled her like a forgotten melody") that occasionally feels writerly rather than character-particular under stress. No dialogue is present; internal voice is coherent and the narrative stance supports emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent but leans toward elevated/literary register ("errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear and deliberate") that occasionally feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Elara's perceptual signature is generic: she notices atmosphere and mood but her way of filtering detail does not reveal character-specific priorities. Psychic distance stays mid-range throughout without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric, favoring elevated register ("oceanic hush," "coax from them the wisdom"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into generic philosophical phrasing ("her mind alight with understanding") and the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to Elara's specific expertise or worldview. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to the traveler's perception. Diction is controlled and the prose has a distinct, literary texture: "her footsteps crunched softly," "the shadows held secrets waiting to be uncovered." The woman's sparse dialogue ("I've been waiting for the ship") carries naturalism and subtext. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("geography of healing," "monument of hope," "tiny obituaries for the day that had passed") that reads more as authorial reach than the traveler's specific perceptual signature under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cavernous realm," "quaking with both fear and reverie"), though occasionally generic ("ancient secrets," "otherworldly glow"). Kael's perceptual signature (weary yet determined) colors description, but under peak pressure the prose remains uniform rather than degrading or sharpening. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") are frequent but voice-motivated given the reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the narrative voice has a distinct lyric texture ("kelp-drift peace," "migration of clouds"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices texture, weight, contrast. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("belied her burden," "unyielding compassion") that reads slightly external to a firefighter's working idiom, but the effect remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices formations, inscriptions, glows—but lacks character-specific bias or selectivity. Diction drifts into elevated register ("sidereal patience," "defiant hush") that reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated. The prose uses filter verbs heavily ("she felt," "she noticed," "she understood") in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains static rather than modulating with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains close throughout. However, the perceptual signature is generic: Elara's interiority recycles abstract phrasing ("profound connection," "delicate balance," "harmonious resonance") without character-specific idiom or sensory bias. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—every paragraph maintains the same elevated, meditation-like register. No elision or purposeful compression; the voice reads as interchangeable across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly and the narrative voice is controlled, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fiercely meditative presence," "thundering calm") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature is more generic literary than carved by her gravestone-carving trade. No dialogue to assess. The prose remains legible but lacks a distinct textural identity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent elevated register ("searing," "reverie," "testament") that fits the contemplative mode. Perceptual signature remains anchored in Elias's professional attention to gears and time. The prose occasionally drifts into academic diction ("ethically diligent," "incremental absolution") that reads prompt-adjacent rather than character-organic. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance narrows during pause moments but the vocabulary stays uniform across emotional peaks, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent—"velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes," "frozen in time"—with a lyric register that fits the contemplative mode. Psychic distance remains close throughout. Perceptual signature (noticing "damp earth and forgotten stories," "threads…waiting to be untangled") reflects the gardener's lens. Some phrasing borders on decorative: "fingers tenderly organized around a trowel" (organized feels like a reach for particular diction), and "silent melody" is a stock pairing. Filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "felt like a puzzle box") cluster in paragraph one but do not obscure voice. Overall, voice is distinct and purpose-driven with minor lapses into ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection, slightly wider during action). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("groundedly imaginative," "the weight of possibility") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue to assess. The perceptual signature is generic cartographer-poet without specific idiom or bias; "the air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine" reads catalog-neutral rather than filtered through Ignorance's professional or personal lens. Narrative certainty matches focalizer knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Clara's perceptual filter ("diligent," "meticulous") colors early description, but voice flattens under pressure—no rhythmic compression or sentence-level reflection of excitement claimed in the text. Phrases like "her heart quickening," "her mind racing" rely on stock bodily clichés rather than character-specific perception. The prose remains uniform across calm transcription and purported discovery, missing the chance to modulate psychic distance or syntax when stakes rise. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. Diction is consistent, leaning toward elevated literary register ("benediction," "somber marvel"). Perceptual signature is present but generic—Elara notices symbols of impermanence without a character-specific filter. No dialogue appears. The prose maintains psychic distance and voice without head-hopping, but the narrative stance reads slightly generic rather than distinctly Elara's particular way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Kael's interiority uses phrases like "his rationally rebellious mind" and "abrasive calm" that feel imposed rather than voice-particular, and his perceptual signature is generic—"fingers tracing," "grip tightened," "mind racing" are stock gestures without idiosyncratic texture. Dialogue is functional but Lira's and Kael's speech ("You're wasting your time down here" / "Because the past holds answers") lack distinct idiom or subtext; both sound equally articulate and thesis-driven. Filter verbs ("looked up to see," "found himself drawn") are present but voice-motivated enough to avoid heavy penalty. Distance is consistent and narration stays within Kael's plausible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara with consistent narrative distance. Diction is elevated and uniform ("velvet," "mausoleum," "cathedral"), fitting a literary register but lacking perceptual signature specific to a choir teacher's professional lens. Dialogue is minimal and functional without subtext. The phrase "traveled stillness" appears twice but reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under emotional pressure—sentence structures remain stately throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is present in selective sensory detail ("scent of rain," "tingling in her fingertips") and her memory-tasting gift colors her interiority. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("synaptic plasticity" appears in narration without dramatization, "informally wise" is a label rather than shown behavior). The grandmother's dialogue ("Pruning isn't about cutting away…") feels writerly rather than spoken. No dialogue among present characters limits assessment of voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter stays anchored to Elara. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("sentinel," "cryptic riddle," "eerie light") that exceeds the voice established by "candid toll keeper." Key moments rely on filter verbs ("felt a strange pull," "realized") that dull immediacy. The piece teaches no purposeful compression or elision; the vision sequence tells rather than shows, weakening the narrative stance at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature ("attuned to subtle shifts") is character-specific, but diction drifts into elevated register ("sanctifying," "resonant reconfiguration of the mundane") that clashes with immediate perception under pressure. The direct address to objects ("You were once part of something greater") is dramatically inert—no subtext, no resistance. Syntactic stems repeat: "He [verb]" opens many sentences without rhythmic variation, flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV alternates focus between Liora and Elara without mid-paragraph head-hopping; switches are clean at paragraph breaks. Liora's perceptual signature is distinct (telepathic reach, "tapestry of whispers"), though some diction ("incisively kind understanding," "nuance she had not welcomed") drifts into elevated register during peak moments. Elara's single line of dialogue feels functional but underutilized for character texture. Psychic distance is stable, but the weeks-later retrospective flattens immediacy in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present ("her mind raced through mathematical proofs"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("balancedly daring," "ruptured the boundaries of logic") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The final sentence's rhythmic parallel ("boundless yet confining...boundless confinement") reads as purposeful echo. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she realized") appear at key beats without muddling immediacy, remaining voice-motivated. No head-hopping or unmotivated POV shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("saffron quiet," "moon-tipped bristles glowing"). Perceptual signature is present but generic—Elara's way of noticing reads interchangeable with default literary prose rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("methodically hopeful," "roused") without earned idiosyncrasy. No head-hopping, and internal access is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; Elara's perceptual signature favors historical and sensory detail ("emerald tint," "warm and fragrant"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("rosewater dread," "catalyst," "beacon of hope") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose carries a measured, slightly formal texture that fits a museum guide. No dialogue appears. The voice is competent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; peak beats (baking, the gathering) maintain the same steady cadence as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent distance and perceptual anchoring through Elias. Diction like "neatly inventive mind" and "bleak exhilaration" recurs as authorial summary rather than emerging from character-specific perception. The voice carries atmospheric texture ("salt and decay," "ancient beast") but the register occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor ("slow exhale of low tide") that doesn't clearly reflect a clockmaker's idiom. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal thought formatting is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable. The narrative voice employs elevated diction ("repulsive allure," "unbosom," "lingering luminance") that matches the gothic-conceptual tone but edges toward artificiality under pressure ("fear feeds on your doubt" reads prompt-like). Dialogue from the advisor is functional but uniform in register. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Clara's way of noticing does not feel distinct or biased.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and psychic distance controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—elevated, slightly archaic ("gnarled," "hum with a life of its own")—and fits the oracular role. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular, and the prose lacks rhythmic variation under pressure: syntactic patterns and paragraph lengths remain uniform throughout, dulling momentum at the climactic xylophone sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature remains consistent (cartographer's focus on patterns, symbols, cracks). Distance is controlled, and the voice carries a fairy-tale formality that fits the premise. The shell-voice dialogue is functional but not distinctly characterized. Elara's lexicon and rhythm are consistent under pressure, though interior texture does not degrade or sharpen meaningfully when stakes rise. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; purposeful elision at the ending ("began her next journey") compresses the transition cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent ("emotionally rational," "loom," "weaving threads") with occasional filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew") that are voice-acceptable. The prose lacks a sharp perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing reads somewhat generic. Dialogue is absent; internal voice shows competence but minimal stress-driven texture or embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the voice carries a consistent register ("firm shore surveyor," "hushed blaze"). However, diction slips into abstraction at peak moments: "interlaced absence," "hushed blaze of anticipation," "archeologist of abandoned dreams" feel imported rather than character-specific. The perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices carvings and mosaics but his way of noticing lacks idiosyncrasy. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate sharply under pressure; the rhythm remains uniform from discovery to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds; no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic ("her mind racing with possibilities"). No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she sensed," "she realized," "she felt") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-melancholy texture ("mist clung to the air like a lover's whisper," "luminous torment"). Lira's brief dialogue is natural and goal-driven. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during emotional peaks ("profound," "futile attempt to outshine the darkness") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The perceptual signature—Kael notices light, gems, and craft tools—is coherent but could be sharper. Free indirect style is clean. Dialogue mechanics are conventional and effective. No major voice slips, but the prose lacks a strongly individuated rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with a distinct elevated register that fits the reflective mode. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Some constructions feel slightly stiff ("intangibly tangible energy," "unfiltered awakening") and drift toward prompt-echo rather than character-particular perception. The perceptual signature—how Zara notices—favors metaphor and abstraction over sensory specificity under stress, which flattens urgency in places but serves the contemplative design.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Kael's perceptual signature is minimal—his "sharp eyes" are mentioned but his way of noticing remains generic. No dialogue appears. Diction is clean but syntactically uniform: many sentences follow "Kael [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" patterns, creating a mechanical rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "seemed") cluster in reflective moments without voice-motivated purpose. The prose reads competent but lacks a distinct textural signature or modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in Elias's attention to detail (grooves, patterns, alignments) befitting a genealogist. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a man in crisis: "meticulously crafted," "stark contrast to the stillness," "hypnotic" feel more authorial than character-rooted. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, but some filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") dull immediacy in peak beats without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focus on Elara holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature (moon-phase synchronicity, mentor's wisdom, empathy-first stance) is consistent but borders on self-aware labeling ("uncommonly thoughtful nature"). Dialogue carries subtext in Kael's "neutrality is a luxury" and Elara's counter, yet both speakers use equally polished syntax under pressure—no tonal distinction or stress-driven compression. Filter verbs ("knew," "felt," "hoped") cluster in the opening without voice necessity. Psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV third-limited remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is character-specific (Mara notices poles as "sentinels," feels "kinship" with utility objects), and the internal texture is consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during reflection, wider during scene-setting). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("melancholic echo," "threshold between known and unknown") that feels slightly imposed rather than organically Mara's idiom under stress. Free indirect style is clean; tense and stance remain stable. The voice is distinct and purposeful, with minor slips in register that don't touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a lyric, reflective texture ("jaded wonder," "delicately robust") that suits the accumulative mode. Psychic distance remains stable, and diction is controlled. However, phrases like "clean slate seeker" and "kindle empathy where none remained" read as imported labels rather than character-specific perception. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but leans toward exposition during peak beats (the swim, the realization).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction carries a lyric register ("cosmic intimacy," "paradoxically steady"). However, perceptual signature is generic: Elara's way of noticing does not reflect beast-whisperer specificity or personal idiom. The guardian's dialogue is expository and tonally elevated ("You have done well, beast whisperer"), lacking character-distinct subtext. Filter verbs appear sparingly. Psychic distance remains consistent. The prose aims for mythic texture but recycles stock fantasy phrasing ("ancient and knowing," "bridge between worlds," "silver light") without a singular voice signature. Free indirect style is clean but underpowered by lack of interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric register ("choking beauty," "shadows that whispered of lives lived and lost") but edges into decorative overwriting in high-pressure moments. Diction remains character-bound with minor lapses ("willingly perplexed" reads as authorial insertion). No dialogue present. Psychic distance stays controlled, though the vision sequence risks convenient omniscience by granting Elara access to moments she never witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, prompt-echo register at peak beats: "gravitationally lighter," "shadow work," "ghostly resolve" read as thematic labels rather than Elara's interior lexicon. Perceptual signature is generic—"her fingers instinctively reached," "her heart raced"—with no character-specific idiom. No dialogue appears. The psychic distance stays constant without intentional modulation, and filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") stack without voice motivation in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clear psychic distance. Elara's perceptual filter (destitute philanthropist, annual pilgrimage, affinity for coincidences) colors observations. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tantalizing mystery," "profound sense of connection") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. The prose texture modulates somewhat with emotional beats—shortening at the archway moment—but the cosmic message voice ("Transformation is not just an act but a state of being") reads external and generic rather than filtered through Elara's idiom. Purposeful compression in the final sequence supports lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is present in Elara's "calmly inventive mind" framing. Diction stays consistent, though phrases like "vigilant lock sentinel" and "cradle of sparks" tilt toward elevated register without clear voice motivation. Dialogue carries goal-driven subtext in Thorne's warning and Elara's reply, distinguishing the two speakers adequately. Psychic distance is controlled, but the final paragraph's "symbol of the knowledge and hope she carried" edges into explicative summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Diction is elevated and mythic ("borrowed dawn," "kaleidoscope of light"), consistent with the voice but occasionally slipping into stock lyricism ("his heart alight"). No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic—Kael notices aurora colors and eel movements without character-specific filtering. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose maintains a steady, slightly distanced tone that fits the fable-like frame.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the prose attempts an elevated register ("rarefy," "stormlit," "vigil in pause"). However, diction drifts into abstract constructions ("furiously tranquil gaze," "storm-kissed wonder") that feel ornamental rather than voice-motivated. The darkroom timer "ticked softly, its rhythm a counterpoint" and similar phrasing reads as authorial decoration rather than Elara's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Dialogue is grammatically clean but tonally identical for both characters—neither carries distinct idiom, subtext, or goal-driven indirection. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the overture of existence") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The mechanical arm's "synthetic limb" and "servos" are described with technical vocabulary but remain external decoration, never filtered through Elias's proprioceptive or tactical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV control is clean; Elias's perceptual filter is consistent (coat patched with stories, verses on scraps). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Clara's "Do you ever feel like we're just patching things up?" carries subtext, and Elias's reply advances his worldview. However, register drifts into elevated metaphor clusters ("blooming resistance," "luminous fracture," "map of scars") that feel authorial rather than vagrant-particular. Free indirect style is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose voice is distinctive but occasionally inflates beyond the focalizer's idiom, preventing higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Interiority favors stock phrasing ("wistful," "steely longing," "newfound purpose") over character-particular perception. Diction remains consistent but elevated in a way that flattens voice—"ethereal breeze," "kaleidoscope of colors," "labyrinthine heart" read ornamental rather than filtered through Elara's specific grief or pianist's lens. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled but the narrative stance lacks the rhythmic modulation or perceptual signature that would elevate it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and grammatically clean. Narrative distance is consistent but generic—"her heart steady," "her mind racing," "the blooms seemed to lean" could apply to any protagonist. The creature's dialogue ("its voice a chorus of whispers") is functional but not distinct from the narrator's elevated register. Diction remains in a single folkloric register throughout with no modulation under pressure. No elision issues; filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are sparse and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited; distance and tense are consistent. Elias's perceptual signature (slow speech, bonsai patience, weighted words) colors narration in the first half but fades in the closure beats, where diction elevates ("otherworldly light," "strange beauty," "rhythmically placid reminder"). No dialogue present to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, but the final insight ("the hue of letting go, of forgiving oneself and others") reads as author summary rather than character-particular thought. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the letter-reading, then widens for reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate, with a measured, contemplative register that matches Elara’s scientific yet reverent gaze. Phrasing like “preprocess reality” and “quiet architect” gives the prose a mild lyric-scientific flavor without breaking plausibility for her background. At times the narration drifts toward abstract explanation instead of letting images carry meaning, but it never loses clarity or focalization. The voice is competent and controlled, if not yet distinctive enough to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and occasionally lyrical, with consistent access to Elara’s perspective. Diction is slightly elevated but not implausible for an artist-character, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the narrative texture feels more generically poetic than uniquely keyed to Elara’s mind; the same sentences could largely be attached to another contemplative protagonist. Rhythm and syntax are competent but not especially distinctive under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative SF premise. Diction choices like “winterglass” and “translator of silence” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping despite Kael’s entrance. A few familiar turns of phrase slightly dilute distinctiveness, but overall control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, fluent, and well-matched to a slightly gothic, lyrical register. Diction (“chased stillness,” “conduit for the city’s soul”) is elevated but coherent with Elias’s introspective, melancholy lens, and POV boundaries hold. Rhythm varies, with some nice cadences, though a few sentences edge toward explanatory summary rather than felt perception. There is room for a more idiosyncratic perceptual signature that more distinctly belongs to Elias rather than a generalized literary narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with occasional nicely textured phrases like “amplified quiet” and “gently persistent reminder.” POV boundaries are respected, and the narrative stance matches the reflective, communal subject matter. Dialogue is straightforward but serviceable, mostly expository rather than subtext-rich. The overall voice is competent and consistent, though not especially distinctive or idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the mystical subject matter, with consistent diction and perspective. The sensory focus and figurative language clearly reflect Elara’s aesthetic, observant sensibility. At times, the prose edges toward uniform lushness, with similar cadences and emotional beats (breath, trembling) recurring. Still, there is no head-hopping or register clash, and the narrative stance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits the fantastical, contemplative premise. Diction like “retrocognitive entrapment” and “hyperbolic geometry” pushes toward the conceptual yet still feels aligned with Elara’s professional, quasi-mystical lens. Psychic distance is stable, and there are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell. The voice is strong and coherent, if not yet uniquely idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, readable, and keeps a stable focalization on the liberator, with occasional nice phrasings (“chains dragging behind them like shadows”). However, the register leans generic-lyric, with repeated constructions and familiar metaphors that blur a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative distance is fairly fixed; it rarely sharpens or compresses in ways that intensify specific beats. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits the synesthetic premise, and the POV never slips. Descriptions like “a soft lavender hum” and “a hollow echo, a silence shaped like a scream” show a distinct perceptual signature. The rhythm is generally well-managed, though it leans into a familiar “elevated fantasy lyric” mode rather than something unmistakably singular. Even so, stance and distance remain coherent and apt through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice on Lira is consistent, mildly lyrical, and generally well controlled; it fits the fable-like, nocturnal mood. Dialogue is clear, cleanly tagged, and functional, though often a bit too articulate and expository for the stakes. There are no POV slips or tense issues, and the narrative stance remains stable. What’s missing for higher marks is a more distinctive, idiosyncratic perceptual signature that feels uniquely Lira rather than genre-neutral.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably contemplative, with a measured, slightly lyrical cadence that matches Elara’s temperament. Her habit of theatrically narrating her own actions is a nice idiosyncratic touch that gives flavor. At times, the diction tilts into generic elevated abstraction rather than fully character-specific phrasing, which keeps the voice from feeling truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with no head-hopping and a reasonably consistent interior filter keyed to Elara’s anxious, sensory focus. Diction is mostly in character and unobtrusive, and the narrative stance doesn’t claim information she couldn’t plausibly infer. The voice has some texture (“trembling certainty,” “timeless embrace”) but leans on a fairly generic lyric register rather than a sharply idiosyncratic one. Still, distance control and clarity under pressure are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, gently elevated, and consistent with a mystic oracle focalizer; diction like “ambered hush” and “marbled hush” feels deliberate, not accidental. The perception pattern—attending to silence, texture, and ritual—creates a recognizable signature. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyric register holds under mild pressure. Slight same-register saturation keeps it from feeling fully exceptional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, legible, and appropriate to a contemplative SF vignette. Diction and distance are consistent, and there are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts. While the voice is competent, it’s not especially idiosyncratic or character-specific; it feels like a neutral literary-SF narrator more than Unit-7’s unique perception. Rhythm and syntax are controlled but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gentle, observant lyricism that matches Elara’s temperament and the quiet-night setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled and coherent; the narrative never over-explains interiority. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, with Kian’s simple, unguarded line nicely contrasting the prior guardedness. There’s a distinct tonal signature without slips in tense or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, coherent, and appropriately close to Elias, with no POV slips. Diction is consistent and calm, matching the meditative tone and his pragmatic temperament. That said, the narrative texture is somewhat generic—few turns of phrase feel inimitably Elias-specific. Strong and publishable, but not yet distinctive enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV remains stable and appropriate, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice is clean and readable, with occasional nice touches (“dance of light and logic”), but it doesn’t yet have a strikingly idiosyncratic texture. Some phrasing repeats and leans on familiar constructions, which flattens distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is competent and controlled rather than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical register that suits the premise and avoids jarring shifts in distance or tense. Diction is generally consistent with a reflective, musically attuned protagonist, and there is no head-hopping. That said, the voice feels somewhat generic—phrases like “her mind racing” and “spark that had been missing from her music” are serviceable but not distinctively hers. Rhythm is competent but not especially surprising or sharp under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches Elara’s reflective, almost mystical sensibility. Phrases like “auroral sorrow” and “swaying certainties” give the prose a recognizable texture without becoming wholly untethered from concrete perception. Dialogue is stylized and oracular yet coherent with the piece’s mythic tone. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and mostly well-matched to the material, with a consistent mildly Gothic-horror register. Mara’s perception is filtered enough through her priorities to avoid a bland omniscient feel, though the idiom sometimes drifts into generic genre phrasing (“haunting reality,” “weight lift from her chest”). There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. While competent, the voice doesn’t yet have a sharply distinctive rhythmic or lexical signature that would stand out in a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable and well-matched to a contemplative, mythic register, with consistent access to Lira’s perceptions and no head-hopping. Diction (“regenerative silence,” “crumbling peace”) is elevated but coherent with the world and character. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrator does not over-explain beyond what the images already imply. A slightly sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature for Lira could push the voice from solid to distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, warm, and slightly lyrical, with clean focalization through Elara and natural-sounding dialogue from Finn. Rhythm and diction are well controlled and suit the tone; there is no head-hopping or register shock. The narrative timbre, while pleasant, is not especially distinctive or idiosyncratic, limiting memorability at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative, archival subject matter. Diction is elevated but mostly controlled, with recurring phrases (e.g., “bronze quiet,” “sensitively perceptive”) that help establish tone, if a bit on-the-nose. There’s no POV slippage or confusing stance; access to Elara’s thoughts is steady. At peak moments, the narrative sometimes explains stakes in summary rather than letting the voice compress into sharper, more scene-rooted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and largely consistent in register, with a mildly elevated, mystical tone that fits the concept. However, diction is often generic (“mysterious,” “enigmatic,” “cryptic,” “familiar enigma”) and repetitive, which flattens the distinctiveness of Li Wei’s perceptual signature. The narrative stance sometimes drifts toward essayistic explanation of what symbols “mean” instead of staying firmly inside Li Wei’s sensory and cognitive experience. Overall, the POV is competent but not yet distinguished or texturally memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and consistent with the metaphysical subject matter. Syntax and diction maintain a ritual, almost liturgical cadence that fits the “priest” frame. There are no POV slips or register jolts, but the voice can feel generically mystical rather than sharply character-specific. It’s competent and coherent, yet not distinctive enough to stand out at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with consistent lyricism that suits the contemplative, ritualistic mood. Diction and syntax create a distinct, slightly elevated narrative texture without obvious register clashes. The perspective remains tightly bound to the writer’s perceptions; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times the voice defaults to generalized lyrical phrasing where a sharper, more idiosyncratic turn might deepen character, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and readable, with some nice phrasings (“trapped between the drop and the ripple,” “darkening brightness”) that give it light lyric texture. At times, diction leans into abstract or slightly clinical phrasing (“core concept of fractured timelines,” “procedural generation”) that clashes with the more atmospheric lines. Psychic distance is mostly well-controlled, and the narration does not head-hop or over-explain action. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that suits a meditative, sensory-focused story about a deaf musician. The perceptual signature—attention to texture, vibration, and tools—feels character-inflected rather than generic omniscience. There are occasional generic phrases and a slightly homiletic tilt in the final paragraph, but no major register shifts or POV leaks. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative stance is mostly aligned with Elias’s perceptions, maintaining clarity in time and space. The prose has moments of pleasing rhythm, but also lapses into abstract or slightly off-register phrases (“credibly curious,” “Deciding to progress laterally”) that feel more like prompt scaffolding than organic thought. Dialogue is functional and clear but leans heavily on exposition, with the masked figure explicitly explaining the situation and theme. Overall, the voice is competent but not yet sharply individualized or texturally memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and moderately lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward light and scent that suits both character and premise. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and shifts into memory are handled smoothly without head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent with a quiet, reflective tone; phrases like “aromatically cautious choices” are stylized but still legible within the piece’s aesthetic. The voice is distinctive and controlled, though not yet so idiosyncratic or risky as to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and gently lyrical, with some strong rhythmic lines and a clear perceptual bias toward pattern and metaphor. Lexicon and register largely fit a reflective poet, and emotional distance is well controlled. There are a few abstract or critic-like phrases (“ethically playful”) that feel more authorial than character-rooted but they don’t derail the piece. Overall, the voice is assured and readable, if not yet unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a clear sensory bias toward sound that suits the protagonist. Syntax and rhythm are varied and confident, and the lyric register feels coherent across the piece. While the voice is strong, it isn’t strikingly idiosyncratic, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and well-suited to a character who deals in delicate, intangible commodities. Diction and rhythm are polished without feeling inflated, and the sensory-focus matches Elara’s profession and method. There are no POV slips or register jolts; the narrative keeps a steady, slightly lyrical tone throughout. What keeps it just shy of exceptional is that the voice, while elegant, is not yet unmistakably idiosyncratic or risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice around Elara is stable, clear, and largely free of POV slippage, with diction that suits a reflective, observant protagonist. Prose rhythm is smooth if somewhat conventional, and dialogue, though sparse, feels natural and functional. The narrative stance occasionally lapses into generic phrasing rather than a sharply individualized idiom, which keeps the voice from being truly distinctive. Still, control is solid and no line-level confusion arises from POV handling.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches the fantastical setting and Lira’s artistic sensibility. Prose maintains a consistent distance and does not head-hop, and the brief dialogue with Echo feels tonally appropriate even if it’s somewhat aphoristic. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, especially in descriptive passages. The voice is strong and polished, though not yet singular or surprising enough to feel unmistakably distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and appropriately lyrical, with a gentle, reflective register that suits the material. Focalization stays within Mara without leakage, and the narrative stance feels consistent across the rooftop and cavern sequences. While the voice has some nice turns of phrase, it does not yet feel uniquely idiosyncratic or risky. Overall, it’s controlled and publishable but not yet distinctive at a “prestige venue” level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mildly lyrical but controlled register that fits a contemplative conjurer and stays consistent throughout. Diction is apt for a fantasy-literary tone and avoids jarring shifts in register or unnecessary exposition; there’s no head-hopping or POV leakage. The perceptual filter is competent but not highly idiosyncratic—Elara’s way of noticing is plausible yet could be more distinctive. Overall, it’s polished and publication-ready but lacks a truly memorable rhythmic or stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, smooth, and maintains a lyrical hush that suits the setting. Diction is controlled and mostly unified; there are no POV slips or register jolts. That said, the voice feels more like a general lyric narrator than something sharply particular to this singular dweller—very few idiosyncratic perceptions or biases. Under pressure, the rhythm and syntax don’t intensify or fracture in a way that would deepen character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, reflective texture that suits the interior focus and botanical setting. Diction and syntax are consistent and controlled, with periodic rhythmic variation that keeps the paragraphing from feeling mechanical. At times the narration drifts into abstract or thematic phrasing (“reluctant metamorphosis,” “symbol of the reluctant metamorphosis she had been resisting”), which flattens the distinctness of Mara’s personal idiom. Still, the POV control is clean and there is no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is steady and appropriate, maintaining Elara’s lens without leakage or head-hopping. The narrative voice has a mildly lyrical, elevated diction that mostly fits the speculative, reflective mode. While not strongly idiosyncratic, the voice is controlled and consistent, with no significant register clashes. Dialogue is brief but serviceable, though it tends toward clean exposition rather than layered subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and readable, with a stable perspective on Elara that occasionally widens to a quasi-omniscient view of the cave and “unseen forces” without causing confusion. Diction is in a familiar lyrical-fantasy register that suits the material, though it leans generic and expository at emotional peaks. There is a perceptible but not particularly distinctive narrative texture; the voice serves the story but does not yet feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with a mildly lyrical, slightly formal register that suits the world and Elara’s vocation. Diction choices like “ocean-spray archivist” and “navigated absences” lend distinct texture without undermining clarity. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the gray-cloaked woman’s voice carries a suitably archaic gravitas. Narrative distance tightens appropriately around the discovery and trumpet blows, showing good modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, fluent, and unobtrusively lyrical, with stable access to Elara’s perceptions and thoughts. Diction is generally appropriate and avoids register clashes, but the narrative texture feels generic rather than distinctly tied to this particular mind. There are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts, and the prose modulates gently with emotional beats. What’s missing at a high level is a more idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make Elara’s interiority unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person close voice is steady, readable, and appropriate to a reflective fairy-tale tone. Diction is mildly lyrical but not idiosyncratic; many turns of phrase (“canvas of stars,” “shower of starlight,” “part of something greater than herself”) are familiar rather than voice-specific. Psychic distance is generally consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The piece lacks the distinct rhythmic or lexical signature expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, elevated, quasi-mythic tone that fits cosmic subject matter and never breaks POV bounds. Phrases like “hushed thunder” and “spatial mutiny” provide some textural distinctiveness. At the same time, diction sometimes slides into generic lyricism and stock abstractions, which blurs Elyr’s individual perceptual signature. There’s rhythmic competence but not yet the kind of sharply controlled, character-specific voice that would stand out in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a consistent lens through Clara’s perceptions and thoughts. Prose is clear and fluent, if somewhat generic in diction and rhythm for an “elite venue” standard. Dialogue is functional and mostly natural but sometimes lapses into thesis-delivery (“Political asylum isn’t the answer,” “We need to find a way to stay—honestly.”). There’s a recognizable but not especially distinctive narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical texture and a clear perceptual bias toward ritual, sound, and minutiae. Diction like “textures of different times” and “invented histories” feels coherent to this character and world. At times the register edges toward mildly generic lyricism, but there are few obvious slips or mismatches. Overall, the voice is controlled and distinct enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyrical voice is consistent and appropriate to the reflective, accumulative design. Diction is generally controlled, though it sometimes lapses into a somewhat generic “literary” register with repeated constructions (“whispered secrets,” “symphony of lives intertwined”) that feel less character-specific than atmospheric. The focalization remains stable with no head-hopping, and the modulation toward a quieter, crystallized tone at the end works. What’s missing is a sharper, idiosyncratic perceptual fingerprint that would make this voice unmistakably this character’s rather than a capable, neutral narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and comfortably lyrical without slipping into abstraction. Diction and rhythm suit a reflective, slightly elevated narrative and stay stable under emotional pressure. There are no POV leaks or stance confusions, and the modulations in sentence length track the scene’s swelling then settling nicely. The voice is competent and pleasant rather than uniquely idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and mildly lyrical, with some nice turns of phrase (“jigsaw puzzle of dreams and desperation”). It remains somewhat generic—more narrator-neutral than distinctly filtered through Lira’s perceptual biases—so the prose doesn’t fully feel like “her mind on the page.” Dialogue is minimal but serviceable; Vorin’s lines are on-the-nose and expository. POV control is clean and stable, without leakage or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance fits the reflective, solitary mission. The voice has some texture—“dawning hush,” “footprints of giants”—and a consistent slightly elevated register. However, it rarely feels unmistakably character-specific; much of the diction could be any competent SF-narrator rather than uniquely Elara. There is no dialogue to test, but the internal narration remains clear and modulates gently with emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical texture that matches Elara’s contemplative, sensory-driven perspective, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly natural, with a clear perceptual signature in how machinery, sound, and light are noticed. That said, some phrases lean generic or expository (“Her motivation was clear,” “She knew the drone’s repair was more than a task”), slightly flattening the otherwise distinctive voice. Overall, it is a confident, coherent narrative stance suitable for publication with modest tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and coherent throughout, with a calm, observant narrative stance that fits Elara’s profession and temperament. The prose maintains a consistent register and psychic distance, avoiding head-hopping or jarring shifts. However, aside from a few nice turns ("silent herald of change," “worrying tranquility”), the voice feels more generally literary than distinctly Elara; her supposed dry wit never colors the narration. It’s controlled and competent rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitable to the quasi-mythic tone. Diction is consistent and largely within one register, and there’s no POV slippage or confusing distance shifts. The narrative often tells rather than embodies feeling, which flattens some moments, but the cadence is generally smooth. The voice has a gentle lyricism, though it doesn’t yet feel idiosyncratic enough for truly elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV on Maya is stable and easy to follow, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Voice is competent but fairly neutral, with repeated formulations (“she realized,” “she felt”) and a tendency toward generalized, elevated diction that could belong to almost any protagonist. Some phrases like “lonesome splendor” and “gathered hush” hint at a more distinctive lyric register but aren’t fully integrated into a unique perceptual signature. Overall, the narration is clear but not especially character-specific or rhythmically daring.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and comfortably inhabits a slightly elevated, fable-like register that fits the premise. Phrases like “copperlight repose” and “chased hush” give the prose a distinct texture without major register clashes. At times the narration tilts toward summary and thematic labeling rather than staying tightly inside Elias’s sensory and emotional experience. Still, point of view remains controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-matched to the gothic, lyrical material, with recurring images (veil, glass, roots, bead) creating a coherent perceptual signature. Syntax and diction show control, leaning elevated without slipping into academic register. At times, the narration lapses into slightly generic abstractions (“Her motivation was clear”) that flatten the otherwise strong voice. Overall, distance and access are steady, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, contemplative mode, with consistent diction and psychic distance. Patterns like “hauntingly optimistic aura/spirit” recur but stay within a controlled register, and there is no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts. The prose’s texture can feel uniform—nearly every paragraph in the same elevated, solemn key—limiting modulation under notional pressure. Still, the perceptual signature (metaphoric, ceremonious, focused on craft and atmosphere) is distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, legible, and appropriate to a contemplative, quasi-mystical tale, and there’s no POV leakage. Diction is generally controlled, though often in a generic literary-lyric register rather than one sharply particular to Elara. Some phrasing (“purposeful wandering,” “interrupted journeys of life”) feels more like authorial commentary than character-filtered perception. Still, the vantage and distance are consistent, and the rhythmic control is competent if not distinctive enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with no POV slippage and a clear focalization through Lyra. Diction is competent and occasionally evocative (“futuristic nostalgia”), but often defaults to safe, neutral phrasing that could belong to many narrators. Narrative distance stays slightly elevated, telling us more than it lets us feel in embodied detail under pressure. The voice is smooth but not yet distinctive enough for immediate high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person-limited POV around Elara is stable and clear, with a consistent elevated-fantasy register that suits the setting. Prose cadence is smooth, and the observational lens (embroidery, constellations, thread metaphors) feels organically tied to her vocation. Dialogue is mostly natural but occasionally drifts into tidy exposition and theme-delivery, especially in Lira’s speeches. There is a discernible voice, though it could sharpen further under stress to feel more idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the mystic, regret-haunted subject matter, with good rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Diction and metaphors are mostly consistent and legible, and the narrative distance holds without head-hopping or stance confusion. While the voice is polished, some phrases (“songs of unseen spirits,” “forgotten truths,” “what could have been”) feel familiar rather than sharply character-specific, and the lyric register risks a mild sameness. Still, it’s controlled and publishable in tone and perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person, lyrically inclined voice is consistent, with distinctive phrasing like “lotus-hearted ache” and “a piece of the ocean’s memory” marking a clear perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm generally match a reflective, sensitive translator under strain. At times the voice leans into abstract summarizing (“Her motivation was clear”) that slightly dilutes immediacy. Still, control of distance and tone is solid, with no POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and well-matched to the reflective, slightly lyrical tone. Diction is mostly in-register and controlled; there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. While the prose is competent and sometimes lovely (“within the fold of a daydream”), it doesn’t yet have a sharply individualized perceptual signature that could only belong to Lira. A few more idiosyncratic observations tied to her muralist sensibility would elevate distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and clear, with no head-hopping and a consistent focus through Elara’s perceptions. Diction generally fits a slightly lyrical but accessible speculative register, and sentence rhythm varies enough to keep the piece readable. Some lines drift toward generic mystical phrasing (“bewitch the soul,” “tapestry of the garden’s history”) that flatten what could be a more idiosyncratic voice. Still, POV control and basic stylistic competence are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV on Elias is stable and confident, with no head-hopping and a consistent filter. Prose rhythm modulates reasonably well between quiet description and tenser beats, and the small amount of dialogue sounds natural for educated clandestine operatives. Elias’s narrative idiom—observant, slightly wry—fits his “rogue scholar” persona, though it could be more idiosyncratic to feel truly singular. There’s minimal exposition-dump feel; world details mostly arise in context.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited lyric voice is steady, with some striking coinages (“reef-shadow joy,” “blossom armistice”) that give the prose a distinct texture. POV control is clean, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing shifts in stance or tense. At times the diction drifts toward generalized abstraction and repetition of similar cadences, which slightly flattens intensity. Still, the voice suits the meditative, mythic mood and remains coherent under mild emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the dreamlike setting, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction choices like “foxglove regret” and “museum of extinct feelings” give the narrative a distinct texture, even if it edges toward genre-lyric familiarity. The voice modulates gently with pressure (quicken, overwhelm, then quiet triumph) without losing control. It’s strong and coherent, though not yet singular enough to feel unmistakably individual.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent lyrical register that suits Elara’s character and the quasi-mystical setting. Diction (“carefully reckless,” “tapestry of truth”) gives the voice a recognizable texture without losing clarity. Dialogue, though brief, reads natural enough and carries emotional weight without over-explaining. There is a mild tendency toward uniform, elevated phrasing, but not enough to break focalization or credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lucid, and attuned to Elias’s mechanical mindset with metaphors like his thoughts working “like the gears of the floodgates.” Rhythms are generally controlled, with some pleasing patterning around the amphitheater “breathing.” There are moments of mildly elevated, abstract diction (“encrypted compassion,” “harmonize conflicting values”) that strain plausibility as Elias’s internal lexicon but they mostly fit a mildly lyrical narrative stance. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with a good balance of concrete image and reflective abstraction. Diction is controlled and generally character-consistent, and the narrative distance is stable. There’s no POV leakage or awkward withholding. The voice is polished and pleasant, though it stops just short of the striking distinctiveness and rhythmic daring that would make it truly stand out at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative, reflective mode. Diction like “fractured hush” and “featherly, light yet unyielding” creates a distinct texture, and the narrative distance stays consistent. There is some mild abstraction and a few slightly self-conscious phrases, but they don’t break the voice. Overall, the perceptual signature feels coherent and recognizable without tipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and convincingly filtered through someone attuned to patterns of land and sky. Phrases like “shadowseam wonder” and “stars trapped in a jar” give the prose a distinctive texture without obscuring sense. There are minor tics—repetition of “softly ingenious,” occasional abstract formulations—but they don’t significantly disrupt the POV or rhythm. Overall, the voice feels deliberate and unified, if not yet startlingly singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is steady and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent psychic distance. The voice has a soft, lyrical texture that fits the contemplative mode and fantastical setting. Some diction and phrasing (“cheerful gloom,” “her heart lighter”) edge toward familiar lyricisms rather than a sharply individuated signature. Rhythm and sentence variety are adequate, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and suits a reflective, quasi-philosophical piece; phrases like “calculated wilderness” give it a distinct texture. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping and a consistent filter through Elias’s sensibility. At times the diction feels more like an omniscient essayist than a truly character-bound consciousness, which flattens immediacy. Still, the prose maintains a coherent, recognizable cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on absence, gaps, and celestial imagery. Diction and rhythm are controlled and suited to a mythic, atmospheric piece, without POV leakage or jarring register shifts. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance remains stable and emotionally attuned. At times the elevated language risks homogeneity, yet overall the modulation under pressure (arrival of footsteps, sentinel) works.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and appropriate to a contemplative piece; it maintains a consistent reflective distance and never breaks POV. Some lines have pleasant cadence and imagery (the prism scattering light, the mist lifting). Yet the diction trends generic at key moments (“keeper of light, a weaver of stories,” “value in the mundane, the extraordinary in the ordinary”), so the voice doesn’t quite achieve a sharply distinctive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-calibrated, with a measured, reflective rhythm that suits Elias’s temperament. Diction is elevated but not wildly mismatched to the quasi-mythic tone the piece aims for, and there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. Some phrasing drifts toward generic spiritual register (“enlighten himself,” “bargained innocence”) that feels more authorial than character-rooted. Even so, the narrative stance remains coherent and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lucid, and comfortably aligned with a reflective, analytical character, with controlled lyricism and stable psychic distance. Diction such as “serene upheaval,” “concept of trial balloons,” and “conceptual repricing” equivalents fits the contemplative tone and doesn’t break POV plausibility. Some patterns of abstraction and similar sentence rhythms (“She…” statements, lists of concepts) create a slightly uniform cadence. Still, the voice remains clear and confidently handled throughout, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mildly lyrical texture that suits the premise and remains largely within the protagonist’s plausible perceptual range. Phrasing like “sensitively perceptive nature” edges toward abstraction, but most of the diction (“the faint hum of history,” “whispers of forgotten centuries”) feels tonally consistent. POV control is clean and free of head-hopping, and the narrative distance stays appropriately intimate. A bit more idiosyncratic, character-specific idiom would distinguish her inner voice from a generalized fantasy-lyric narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and slightly distant, with a controlled, almost incantatory rhythm that suits the subject. Diction is generally apt for the mode, and the patterned description of notes and mirages builds a cohesive narrative stance without head-hopping. At times the language drifts toward generic-poetic formula (“air hummed with the promise of renewal”), which blurs the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Overall, the voice is solid and fitting, if not singularly striking.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a consistent elevated register that suits the quasi-mythic, ritual tone of the piece. The narrative voice is smooth and grammatically clean; there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shift. That said, Elara’s perceptual signature is not especially idiosyncratic—the diction and imagery could plausibly belong to many generic “epic fantasy” narrators. The voice is competent and occasionally lyrical, but not yet distinctive enough for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, close enough to Elara to carry her guilt and resolve while maintaining a controlled, lyrical distance. Diction and rhythm are generally well-managed, with clean syntax and no POV leakage or awkward register shifts. The perceptual signature—observing cracks as a “blueprint of the land’s memory,” for instance—feels consistent with a reflective, self-aware protagonist. It’s strong and polished, though not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and no POV slippage. Diction like “harvest of echoes,” “alarming serenity,” and “time seemed to stretch between sigh and smile” creates a recognizable tonal texture. At times the register veers toward uniform high-poetic phrasing, giving the narration a slightly generalized, ceremonial feel rather than a fully individualized consciousness. Still, the voice is controlled, legible, and coherent with the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a measured, reflective cadence that matches Elias’s temperament and the contemplative situation. Lexicon and rhythm are generally consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing slips toward generic abstraction (“the vast space seemed to mirror his inner turmoil”), which slightly blunts the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Overall, though, the narrative voice is controlled and coherent enough for publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s esoteric realism, with controlled shifts between interiority and external description. Syntax and diction feel deliberate, with a recognizable rhythmic pattern that supports the meditative mode. At times, the register leans toward generalized poeticism that blurs Elara’s individual idiolect, making the narrator feel slightly more abstract than character-specific. Still, point of view remains steady and reliably bounded to her perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, solitary frame. Diction (“icebound sanctum,” “snowmelt ardor”) has a distinct texture without glaring register slips, and POV distance remains stable. There is some tendency toward generalized abstraction and similar cadential patterns, but not enough to seriously muddy perspective. Overall, the voice is polished and publishable, though not yet singularly arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, with a stable third-person focus through Foresight; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction (“ethereal grit,” “precisely playful landscape”) gives the piece a recognizable texture without major register slips. At times, the abstraction and repetition flatten immediacy, but the narrative distance remains controlled. Overall, it reads as a coherent, if slightly uniform, elevated voice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and clear, with no POV slippage or confusing distance shifts. Diction is somewhat elevated but generally consistent; however, phrases like “empirically ironic nature” and repeated formulaic clauses (“encrypted devotion,” “seal a covenant with the unknown”) lend a slightly generic, prompt-fulfilling feel. The narrative doesn’t strongly reflect a distinctive consciousness—Kael’s scientific mindset and skepticism aren’t deeply embedded in how perceptions are phrased. Overall, it’s competent and readable but lacks a sharply individual perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and serviceable, with clean handling of dialogue and interior access mainly through Elara. Diction is largely generic fantasy-lyric and self-help register, not especially distinctive to these characters or this world. Minor slips into explanatory narration (“a method she had honed over years of studying the subtle art of persuasion”) flatten immediacy but don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical diction that fits Elara’s craft-focused, contemplative perspective. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and shifts in rhythm (slowing for the breathing, quickening around the fusion of fragments) support emotional beats. Limited dialogue is natural and purposeful, carrying exposition and awe without feeling expository-clunky. The voice is distinct and controlled, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a clear focalization through Elara’s perceptions and priorities. Syntax and diction are controlled and readable, with some pleasing turns of phrase. The narrative stance does occasionally drift into generalized, slightly abstract language that could belong to many narrators rather than a highly specific Elara-inflected voice. Still, distance and access remain consistent and functional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and free of head-hopping, and the narrative stance stays aligned with Elara’s perceptions. The voice has some musical phrasing and an appropriately contemplative register that matches the speculative-philosophical mode. That said, it lacks a strongly distinctive perceptual signature and sometimes slips into generalized, slightly purple abstraction. Dialogue is sparse and serviceable but not especially textured or subtext-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    The close third-person on Elara is stable and clear, with no head-hopping and a consistent, mildly elevated fantasy register. The voice is smooth but somewhat generic; it lacks a strongly idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make Elara’s mind feel unique. Dialogue is sparse and largely functional, with Kael’s few lines not strongly distinguished in rhythm or diction. Overall, the POV control is sound, but stylistically more competent than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, moderately lyrical, and well-matched to a contemplative fantasy piece; diction is consistent and there’s no POV leakage. Sentences flow smoothly with varied rhythms, and the narrative stance maintains a clear filter through Elara’s sensibility. Some phrasing trends generic or slightly abstract, which blunts distinctiveness of voice, but nothing jars. There is no dialogue to test, yet the interior narration carries the story without mechanical stiffness.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close-ish POV on Elara is stable and consistent, and the elevated, slightly formal diction matches the quasi-mystical-academic setting. The narrative voice is competent but not particularly idiosyncratic; it often opts for generalized abstraction (“clear complexity,” “fables of absence”) over more character-specific observation. There are no POV slips or tense issues. Rhythmic control is solid but leans on similar sentence patterns, which can blur intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and suited to a mythic/lyric fantasy register, with consistent access to Lira’s perceptions and no head-hopping. Diction (“harmonic caves,” “ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “bloom of hush”) provides a distinct texture even if Lira’s inner idiom isn’t deeply individualized. The narrative stance stays at a moderate psychic distance, which fits the fable-like tone but also mutes sharper emotional specificity. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent, if not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is steady third-person limited on Elara with no leakage, and the narrative stance is consistent and appropriate for quiet, reflective SF/fantasy. The voice has some distinct turns (“thistle-blown hope,” “shard of hush”) but otherwise sits in a fairly generic elevated-fantasy register. Exposition and interiority are cleanly handled without over-explaining, though the diction occasionally drifts toward abstract statement at thematic beats. It’s controlled and fluent, if not particularly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, legible, and well-matched to a contemplative, fantastical scene. Diction is lyrical but mostly controlled, with consistent register and no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. While the voice is pleasant rather than strikingly idiosyncratic, it carries the imagery and atmosphere smoothly. Psychic distance remains coherent, neither abruptly zooming out nor over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic tone, with consistent diction and distance throughout. Phrasing like “its frayed edges glinting like a promise” and “her voice weaving through the stillness like a thread through fabric” shows controlled rhythm and image. There are some familiar formulations (“the air was thick with anticipation,” “eyes hollow”) that dilute distinctiveness. Still, the perceptual stance feels coherent and confident from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mild lyricism that suits the contemplative mode. Some phrasings (“ever-unfolding tapestry,” “hidden rhythms of time”) feel generic and could belong to almost any reflective fantasy, which blunts distinctiveness. There’s solid control of tense and distance, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain beyond its reflective brief. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally graceful but not yet singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and stays within Elara’s sensibility, with stable tense and no head-hopping. Diction like “gilded hush,” “symphony of nothingness,” and “flavors of silence” gives the narrative a recognizable texture without losing clarity. Occasionally, phrases such as “tone stretching contracted” feel more like abstract flourish than organic thought, slightly thinning the character-specific feel. Still, POV control is solid and the voice suits the fable-like, speculative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person voice is controlled, gently lyrical, and consistent, with clean handling of Elias’s focalization and unobtrusive shifts into descriptive distance. Dialogue is natural enough and aligned with character (though slightly polished), and point of view remains stable. The perceptual signature is competent but not particularly idiosyncratic; phrases like “drifted fluidly logical” feel more stylistic than character-rooted. Overall, voice supports the concept but doesn’t quite rise to a memorably singular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person narration is stable, clear, and appropriate, with no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. The voice has some texture in its descriptive choices, though it often defaults to neutral fantasy diction rather than a sharply individuated Lira-specific idiom. Exposition is mostly embedded in action, and there is no intrusive “helpful narrator.” Rhythm is competent, if somewhat uniform, and could benefit from sharper modulation at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical register that suits a contemplative dark-fantasy mode. Diction is mostly controlled and coherent with Lira’s solemn perspective, and there is no POV slippage or confusing stance shift. Some phrasing tilts toward generic epic-fantasy abstraction, which slightly blunts distinctiveness (“encroaching darkness,” “souls she had saved,” “beacon of hope”). Overall, the voice is polished and readable but not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person prose is clean, stable, and accessible, with occasional striking phrases (“sky was painted with equations that shimmered like stars”). The narrative distance is consistent and free of head-hopping, and the glitchy messages are handled clearly. However, the voice feels more serviceable than distinctive; Elara’s perception doesn’t carry a strongly idiosyncratic idiom, and some diction leans generic (“virtually mischievous spirit rising to the challenge,” “scientific and mystical”). There’s little modulation of rhythm under peak beats, keeping the affect relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person narration is stable, with a consistent, gently ornate register that fits the atmospheric, quasi-gothic material. Phrases like “sepia reading room” and “bridge of intuition” contribute to a distinct texture, even if they recur a bit formulaically. There’s no head-hopping or POV leakage; time and psychic distance are handled cleanly through the shift into and out of the vision. At times, the diction slides toward generalized lyricism rather than a sharply personal perceptual signature, keeping this short of standout literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, with clear access to Alaric’s perceptions and a stable psychic distance. Diction like “shivering bliss,” “dance of possibility,” and “threads and wood” gives the prose a recognizable texture without serious register breaks. A few word choices (e.g., “factually mystical”) jar against the otherwise smooth poetic tone, feeling more like prompt-fulfillment than organic voice. Overall, the narrative stance feels controlled and apt for the contemplative, surreal material.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mildly lyrical register that fits an introspective archivist and stays consistent. There are some nice turns of phrase (“lives reduced to manila folders,” “relics of a love that had endured”) that give texture without derailing clarity. The voice is competent and pleasant but not yet sharply idiosyncratic or rhythmically distinctive enough for top-tier venues. POV handling is clean, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience beyond soft lyric generalization.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV on Mara is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent moderate distance. Diction is generally apt for a slightly elevated, quasi-lyric speculative tone, and the narrative stance stays coherent across action and reflection. However, the voice lacks a sharply individual signature or idiosyncratic noticing that would make it unmistakably Mara rather than genre-default. The result is clean, professional narration rather than truly distinctive voice work.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, mystical material. Diction (“vested hush,” “negative space,” “quietly vivid”) creates a consistent sonic palette and perceptual bias toward atmosphere. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays appropriate for a lyric fable. Occasionally the register drifts toward abstraction, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly archaic-lyrical, and suited to the fable-like tone. Diction choices such as “ashen skyborne arbor” and “mossy delight” give the narration a distinct texture without full-on opacity. There are some tendencies toward abstract phrasing and repeated sentence rhythms, but they do not seriously harm clarity. Overall the POV control is solid, if not particularly risky.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, calm, and slightly lyrical, with a gentle fairy-tale cadence that suits the material. Diction is mostly controlled and appropriate, with a few mannered phrases (“uncertainly certain purpose”) that brush against self-consciousness but don’t break the spell. Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. While the voice isn’t strikingly idiosyncratic, it is competent and reliably clear.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the narrative voice—measured, slightly formal, gently lyrical—aligns well with Elara’s reflective temperament and the quasi-mystical setting. Diction is largely consistent, though phrases like “factually mystical blend” feel slightly mannered and draw attention to the prose. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctions, but interior access and descriptive lens remain coherent throughout. Overall, the voice is distinct and competent, if not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled, gently mystical register that suits the material. POV is stable, and interior access to Elara is smooth, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrases feel stock (“weight of her mission,” “soft, golden light”), which slightly flattens distinctiveness. Still, the overall rhythmic control and tonal cohesion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly elevated lyric register well-matched to the surreal setting. Diction like “ultraviolet penance” and “network of life that mirrored the connections in her mind” gives the piece a recognizable texture. At times, the register slides toward conceptual/clinical language (“proprioceptively enhanced senses,” “trauma responses”) that feels more essayistic than embodied, but it doesn’t break POV coherence. Overall the voice is competent and distinct, if not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-controlled, with no POV slippage. Diction is largely appropriate to the quasi-fantastical setting and Lila’s reflective nature. While the prose has some texture—“chorus of the eternal instant,” “elusively tangible”—it does not yet feel utterly distinctive or character-specific so much as generically poetic fantasy. The distance modulation is competent, but there are few surprising turns of perception that would make the voice unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that fits Marcus’s observant, technically skilled perspective. Phrasing like “weightless burden” and the attention to tools and structures give the narration a faintly idiosyncratic texture without sliding into purple prose. At peaks, the voice doesn’t markedly compress or fracture in a way that would deepen pressure; the rhythm remains controlled but relatively safe. Overall, the POV is well-handled and clean, if not especially daring.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, slightly elevated, and suits the fable-like, speculative tone. Diction is consistent and mostly within a single lyrical register, without head-hopping or tense slips. There is some sameness of rhythm and a tendency toward explanatory sentences at key turns, but no major register shocks. The perceptual signature (fixation on patterns, symmetry, and textual/visual motifs) gives Elara a mild distinctness of lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and distinct, with a controlled lyricism suited to a “poetically inclined” focalizer and this ornate setting. Diction choices like “temporal plasticity,” “baroque asteroid,” and “burnished sorrow” feel of a piece, and the narrative distance stays inside Elara’s worldview without stray omniscient commentary. Rhythm varies nicely between lush description and more direct causal beats, and there’s no POV slippage or mechanical dialogue to muddy tone. At times the register leans slightly explanatory, but it doesn’t significantly undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to fable-like fantasy, with recurring sonic and mechanical imagery giving it a recognizable texture. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there’s no POV leakage or awkward head-hopping. Some phrasing tends toward the generic-poetic (“a waterfall of stars,” “melodies from silence”), but it remains legible and tonally coherent. The voice is polished and pleasant, if not particularly idiosyncratic or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person perspective is consistent and well controlled, with no head-hopping and a stable, slightly elevated lyrical register. Elara’s perceptual bias—toward scents, forgotten machinery, and subtle energies—gives the voice some individuality, though it leans toward a familiar “poetic explorer” timbre rather than something idiosyncratic. Rhythm and syntax are smooth and varied, and moments of heightened language generally match the uncanny material. Occasional generalized formulations (“where explanations fail,” “something greater”) blunt the distinctness of the voice at key thematic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and coherent, with a consistent slightly-elevated diction that fits a reflective, artistic protagonist. Phrases like “turbine-hum reverie” and “timewoven alliances” give the voice some texture without losing clarity, though they occasionally edge toward conceptual jargon. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and shifts in intensity (storm vs. quiet chamber) are managed cleanly. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable but could better embody stress and urgency in the tightest moments.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and suitably intimate with Elara’s perceptions, maintaining a coherent distance throughout. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but not jarringly so for an introspective artist focalizer. There is some sameness of cadence and tone, with few sharp modulations as stakes supposedly intensify, which mildly flattens peaks. Still, POV control is clean and free of leakage or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits the contemplative, reverie-like mode. Sentence rhythms are reasonably varied, and the perception is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The voice is competent and coherent but not especially idiosyncratic; much of the phrasing could belong to a generic “lyric speculative” narrator. Still, there is no head-hopping or register whiplash, and the brief dialogue fits the surrounding narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, clear, and unobtrusively competent, with no head-hopping or tense drift. Diction is consistent but somewhat generic; it does not yet feel distinctly Elara’s, nor especially idiosyncratic or textured. The narrative stance occasionally slides into explanatory summary (“Her motivation was clear”) that flattens immediacy. Overall it’s solidly readable but not yet distinctive or shaped for maximal emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mild lyricism that suits the contemplative mode and never breaks POV boundaries. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and phrases like “velvet disquiet” feel intentional rather than gratuitous. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative distance is consistent and appropriate. The voice is pleasant and coherent, though it doesn’t yet feel strikingly individual or surprising under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a gently elevated, quasi-mythic diction that suits the material. Sentences are generally well-shaped, readable, and modulated to maintain a calm, reverent tone. At times the language drifts toward generic mystical phrasing (“wild serenity,” “texture of borrowed time,” “vortex inheritance”) rather than a more idiosyncratic Elara-specific voice. Still, POV control is clean and there are no stance or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-matched to a contemplative, atmospheric piece. Diction and rhythm remain consistent, with a gentle lyricism that suits the “solstice hush” tone. At times the voice drifts into abstract summary or editorializing rather than staying tightly in Elias’s sensibility, which flattens intensity. Still, there are no egregious POV slips or register shocks.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical diction that fits the cosmic-spiritual subject. Sentences are generally clear and well-modulated, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing leans into generic spiritual abstraction (“paradoxical truth,” “quiet force”) that slightly blurs the otherwise distinct texture. Overall, the POV control is solid but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Elias and maintains a quiet, contemplative tone that suits the material. Diction is elevated but generally controlled, and POV does not slip or overreach what Elias could know. That said, the narrative texture is fairly conventional for lyrical fantasy; it lacks a strikingly individual idiom or surprising turns of phrase. The voice supports the story without yet feeling distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close-ish POV on Elara is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping and clean handling of brief dialogue. Narrative diction is clear and controlled but fairly neutral, without a strongly distinctive perceptual signature or rhythm that feels inseparable from Elara. Moments like “the day after numbers changed meaning” hint at a more idiosyncratic voice that isn’t fully developed elsewhere. Overall, the voice is competent and smooth but not yet remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, fluent, and comfortably lyric, with sensory-rich diction that suits a poet protagonist. Dialogue is clean and mostly natural, though both characters speak in similarly gentle, slightly elevated tones. The narrative occasionally leans into poetic abstraction but remains legible and tonally consistent. Overall, it feels controlled and polished, if not particularly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and suits the quasi-mythic, contemplative mode. It maintains a consistent distance and doesn’t commit obvious POV breaches or register shocks. Yet the diction and rhythm are fairly generic for this kind of elevated fantasy and rarely feel idiosyncratically Elias-specific. There’s competence without much distinctiveness or surprising turns of language.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits an academically inclined protagonist. Phrasing like “bronze quiet,” “artificial pilgrimage,” and “chemistry of homecoming” gives the piece a distinct texture without major register slips. Psychic distance is handled well, blending external detail and interior reflection smoothly. The main ceiling is that the voice, while polished, doesn’t yet feel singular enough to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and formally controlled, with a consistent solemn register that suits a mythic, post-apocalyptic fable. Phrasing like “narrow vastness” and “submerged concord” feels intentional and gives the piece a distinct tonal stamp. The distance is relatively omniscient and smooth, though it occasionally drifts into generalized commentary, which blurs the coachman’s specific perceptual signature. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice remains coherent through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person close voice is steady and competent, blending worn lyricism with concrete detail; lines like “sun bled into the horizon” and “wild hush of the factory” feel tonally unified. POV boundaries are respected, and the diction fits the character and world without jarring register shifts. That said, the voice is not yet distinct enough to be unmistakable—its textures are pleasing but familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and readable, with a consistent elevated, slightly lyrical register that fits the speculative, contemplative frame. Diction is mostly appropriate, though it leans on familiar abstractions (“fabric of reality,” “ancient dance,” “patchwork of disjointed moments”) that could belong to many similar stories. The narrative distance holds steady, but it doesn’t develop a sharply particularized perceptual signature for Elara. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext, keeping the voice competent but not distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and appropriate to secondary-world fantasy, with no POV slips or tense issues. Diction is elevated but generally consistent with the mythic tone, and interior access to Kael is smooth if somewhat generic. There isn’t a strongly idiosyncratic perceptual signature—many lines could belong to any fantasy quest-narrator. Competent and readable, but not stylistically distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, controlled, and comfortably elevated, matching the contemplative mode. Dialogue is clear and mostly natural for the tone, with observable status dynamics between Kael and Elara. The narrative diction does at times lean toward a generalized “literary” register that could belong to many narrators, rather than a distinctively Elara-inflected lens. Still, POV is stable and free of leakage or mechanical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, almost fable-like register that fits the magical bookstore premise. The diction ("labyrinthine," "mercury-glass seer," "hidden thunder") has some texture and is generally consistent with the tone. At the same time, the voice leans on generic formulations (“simple yet profound,” “no ordinary artifact”) that blunt its distinctiveness and edge. It never quite develops the idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make Elara’s mind feel singular on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a lyrical, slightly elevated diction that suits the fable-like premise. Phrases like “woven hush” and “fierce repose” give the prose some texture, and the interior perspective remains anchored in Elara. At times, the register drifts toward generalized abstraction (“the weight of her guilt,” “the layers of self-blame”), which blurs her unique perceptual signature. There are no POV slips, but the voice could risk more idiosyncrasy and compression under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to a ritualized, interior piece; diction and rhythm are controlled and generally in character. The narrative does not head-hop or break psychic distance in jarring ways, and shifts in intensity are matched by sentence rhythm. Some lines use somewhat familiar turns of phrase (“awakening from a long slumber,” “weight of the canyon’s echoes”), which slightly dulls distinctiveness but does not undermine coherence. Overall, the voice feels unified and confident, if not yet unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and mostly well-matched to the slightly elevated, lyrical mode. There’s a recognizable rhythmic pattern—periodic long, flowing sentences punctuated by short emphasis—that suits the enchanted-industrial setting. At key thematic beats, though, the diction drifts into generic inspirational language that blunts the distinctiveness of the voice. POV control is clean, but the narrative texture doesn’t quite rise to a singular or surprising register.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, fluent, and suitably lyrical for the material, with no POV slippage or tense confusion. Diction sits in a conventional literary register that matches the contemplative subject, though it rarely feels idiosyncratic or deeply character-specific. Reflection and description predominate, but the narrative stance remains clear and steady throughout. Overall, the voice is competent and pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a calm, slightly lyrical texture that suits Elias’s temperament and the story’s contemplative mode. Diction and syntax are controlled and largely free of register jarring or head-hopping. While the voice is not radically distinctive, its perceptual focus (light, scent, quiet sensations) gives it some character-specific flavor. Dialogue is sparse but clean and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly lyrical register that fits Mara’s contemplative, quasi-mystical task. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly free of anachronistic register shifts or explanatory intrusions. The voice, however, sometimes tends toward generalized abstraction and theme-signaling over character-specific perception, flattening its distinctiveness. There are no POV leaks or confusing shifts, but it doesn’t yet have the idiosyncratic edge that would make it unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits a rational, solitary forager in a strange, wounded world. Diction like “fractured grace” and “psychological safety” pushes toward conceptual but fits the quasi-speculative frame. Mara’s dialogue is simple and believable, and the narration does not slip in and out of other minds. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and psychic distance is handled steadily.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and slightly formal, matching Elias’s temperament and the meditative mode. Diction is controlled and coherent, with recurring lexical choices (“gaps,” “mist,” “softly persistent”) that build a perceptual signature. There’s no POV slippage or intrusive authorial commentary. At times the voice drifts toward generalized lyricism rather than something uniquely Elias-specific, which keeps it just below standout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited is steady and functional, with no head-hopping and a consistent vantage anchored in Elias. The voice is readable and occasionally lyrical (“cobblestone streets whispered tales of forgotten eras”) but also generic; it doesn’t yet feel inextricable from Elias’s sensibility. Expository lines in the figure’s speech sound like narrator-thesis rather than character-specific language. Rhythm and diction are competent but not distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and appropriate; we stay inside the queen’s sensorium and thought frame without leakage. Diction is generally controlled and readable, with a recognizably lyrical-fantasy register. However, some phrasings (“lacy menace,” “softly commanding”) feel more like authorial ornament than the queen’s own perceptual signature, slightly blurring voice specificity. Rhythm is competent but not especially distinctive or risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and generally well controlled, with a consistent register that suits the quasi-mystical premise. Dialogue is functional and clear, though it often serves as direct exposition of theme rather than carrying much subtext or friction. Some repeated constructions and elevated phrasing (“scientifically romantic,” “palette of resolve,” “cartographer of the soul”) risk feeling self-conscious. Still, the POV remains coherent and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to a lucid dream chronicler, with consistent diction (“feral nostalgia,” “jaded wonder,” “labyrinth of her own mind”) that feels character-appropriate. POV control is clean; we remain anchored in Elara’s perceptions even in the dream, and the slight elevation in register aligns with her introspective, quasi-mystical sensibility. Rhythms vary enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous, and the brief dialogue from past selves is distinct yet tonally integrated. There are no head-hops or stance slips that undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a calm, slightly lyrical texture that suits Elara’s temperament. Diction mostly stays within a plausible register for the character while still giving the prose a polished literary feel. Dialogue is sparse but natural and does work to reveal stakes and history without overexplaining. There is minor convergence between narrative and thematic abstraction near the end, but not enough to seriously undermine POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly lyrical register that suits the fantastical setting and introspective focus. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly character-appropriate, avoiding jarring register shifts. There are a few generic turns of phrase, but also some memorable lines (“time felt elastic, stretching and contracting like the breath she now held”). Overall, the POV handling is confident and unobtrusive, if not uniquely distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and psychic distance. Phrases like “its aisles lined with shelves that whispered secrets of centuries past” establish a textured, slightly gothic register that the piece maintains. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and access to thought and perception is clean. Some lines edge toward familiar lyricism, but overall the voice feels controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and appropriately elevated for the mythic mode, with some nice turns (“dust danced in beams of forgotten light”). Diction is occasionally repetitive and leans on abstraction, but psychic distance is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shift. The voice, however, feels somewhat generic-literary-fantasy rather than distinctly bound to this particular consciousness. Under higher pressure, we’d want more idiosyncratic perception or rhythm to distinguish it in a competitive venue.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.6)
    The close third-person POV is stable and appropriate, and the narrative diction—“fjord quiet,” “hydraulic clock shepherd”—has a mild, distinctive flavor. Voice control is consistent; there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. At the same time, much of the phrasing (“relentless march of time,” “landscape of endless possibility”) veers generic, flattening what could be a truly singular perceptual signature. The piece reads smooth and competent but not yet memorable at the level of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV on Elara is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Prose has a gently lyrical texture suited to the setting, and the narrative distance remains appropriate for this contemplative moment. Dialogue reads slightly formal and expository, especially from the figure, but it remains syntactically clean and easy to follow. The voice is competent and coherent, if not particularly idiosyncratic or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature centered on texture, light, and introspection. Diction is generally consistent with a thoughtful, educated character and supports the melancholy tone. There is occasional register lift into essayistic abstraction, but it does not break POV coherence. No dialogue appears, which keeps the focus on internal rhythm and avoids head-hopping issues.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and well-matched to the eerie, contemplative tone, with a few strong phrasings (“melodically haunted relic,” “cultivated estrangement”). Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural, supporting the uncanny mood without over-explaining. The narrative diction occasionally drifts into abstraction when Eli “realizes” the disc’s nature, which slightly flattens the otherwise atmospheric voice. It’s controlled and professional, if not quite distinctive enough yet to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice around Elara is stable, gently lyrical, and consistent in register. The diction (“walnut-ink archivist,” “haunted euphoria”) gives some texture without losing clarity. There is minimal dialogue but what exists is straightforward and functional. The voice rarely surprises or deepens under pressure, which keeps it from feeling truly distinctive at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Voice has a gentle, slightly elevated lyricism suited to the quasi-mythic premise, and the brief dialogue from her other self feels natural enough within the tone. That said, the narrative idiom leans generic at times (“boundless possibilities,” “whispers of what once was”), blurring Elara’s distinct perceptual signature. Distance control is competent but not especially daring or idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with diction that suits a lyrical, speculative fable. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance doesn’t overstep what Elara can plausibly sense, leaning on vibration, sound, and touch. Repeated phrases (“stillpoint,” “melody,” “ultrasonic forest”) function as intentional motifs rather than artifacts. While the voice is more generalized-literary than sharply idiosyncratic, it’s confident and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is clean and readable, with a mildly lyrical SF tone that suits the material. Nonetheless, much of the diction (“odd stillness,” “shimmering void,” “kaleidoscope of possibility”) feels generalized to the genre rather than a sharply idiosyncratic Elara-specific perceptual signature. There is competent modulation under pressure, but the voice doesn’t yet feel singular or indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical texture that suits the contemplative mode. Diction and syntax are controlled and largely free of register clashes or POV leakage. Repetition of certain sentence patterns and abstractions (“Her hands moved…”, “She thought of…”) slightly flattens the rhythmic variety but doesn’t break immersion. Overall, the voice feels competent and coherent, if not especially idiosyncratic or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and coherent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction generally fits a reflective, atmospheric tale. Still, the narrative texture is fairly interchangeable with many genre-neutral voices; “analytically intuitive” and “volcanic tenderness” don’t deeply reshape syntax, metaphor, or perception patterns. There’s some repetition in phrasing and a tendency toward abstract emotional labels over sharply observed moments. The voice is competent and clear, but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lucid, and comfortably lyrical, with sound-based imagery giving it a distinct texture. Phrases like “the hush of the universe inhaling” and “liquid memory” set a consistent, slightly elevated register that matches the speculative mood. At times, the diction lapses into familiar abstractions and taglines (“weaver of dreams,” “breathe life into the shared dream”) that flatten the otherwise particular voice. Overall, the POV control is clean, but the stylistic choices lean a bit on genre-lyric defaults rather than fully idiosyncratic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance is appropriate for a reflective, lightly fantastical piece. Prose rhythm is competent and mostly unobtrusive, and Mira’s brief dialogue has a distinct, sharper edge compared to the narration. Still, Eli’s perceptual signature is only mildly differentiated—word choice and syntax feel generically “literary” rather than idiosyncratic to a person who knows the labyrinth through sound and pattern. Under pressure, the voice tends toward safe, familiar formulations instead of sharpening into something more charged or particular.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and appropriate to the meditative frame, with no POV slippage. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional phrases (“stillwater tension,” “spiralingly calm demeanor”) feel like self-conscious coinages rather than organic thought. The single line of dialogue is serviceable if plain, and the narration carries most of the emotional weight. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable and mildly lyrical, with recurring phrases that create a unified mood. Diction like “hush where past meets prophecy” and “forests of second thoughts” gives texture but sometimes reads more like authorial register than a character-shaped perception. POV stays consistent with no head-hopping or temporal confusion. The rhythm is pleasant, if occasionally over-smoothed and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suited to a quiet, mythic fable: calm, measured sentences with occasional lyrical lift match Elara’s contained, observant nature. Word choice and rhythm are generally controlled without register clashes or POV leakage. While the voice is pleasant and coherent, it doesn’t yet have a sharply distinctive edge or surprising linguistic turns that would push it into standout territory for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and mostly well-matched to Elara’s reflective, subdued perspective. Her inner narration of mundane tasks adds a distinct touch of theatricality and self-consciousness that fits her history as an actor. Diction is generally consistent, though at times it leans into mildly generic dystopian phrasing rather than something more idiosyncratically hers. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice stops short of feeling singularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent elevated, lyrical register that suits the mystical premise. Diction choices like “lantern-moth hush,” “cobalt atrium,” and “gentle art of paraphrase” give the piece texture, and there are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies. At the same time, the voice trends toward a generalized “poetic mystical” idiom rather than something sharply personal to this poet’s sensibility, and certain phrases recur in slightly hollow, thesis-like ways. Rhythm is controlled but sometimes uniform, contributing to a soft, almost monotone rapture.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to an accumulative, sensory-focused piece; diction and syntax are controlled without drifting into academic or over-ornate register. Elias’s perceptual signature—attuned to texture, light, and motion rather than hue—is distinct and carries through the narration. The brief dialogue from the glassblower is simple but natural and functional. Some summary-style thematic sentences slightly flatten the otherwise textured voice at key moments, but overall distance and stance are well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, readable, and mildly lyrical, with a consistent contemplative distance. Diction suits the quasi-speculative, meditative tone and avoids jarring register shifts. That said, the voice is not strongly idiosyncratic; it feels like competent, generalized literary-narrative prose rather than a singular perceptual signature. Control is solid, but not distinctive enough for a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, slightly elevated, and appropriate for the contemplative, genre-adjacent tone. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a consistent lyrical texture that doesn’t significantly drift in register. While competent and at times graceful, the voice is not yet so idiosyncratic or surprising as to feel unmistakably singular. POV control is clean and unobtrusive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close POV on Elara is stable, and the narrative diction—slightly elevated, imagistic, and analytic—matches her role as cartomancer-analyst. Prose has a recognizable cadence without slipping into academic or corporate register despite the data and blockchain material. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with Mira’s lines doing clear plot and emotional work. There are occasional generic formulations, but no serious distance slips or voice incongruities.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s scholarly, quasi-mystical perspective. Diction (“atoms of nostalgia,” “bronze prism pagoda,” “steadily unpredictable”) creates a distinct texture without major register slips. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and psychic distance is well-managed, zooming in at key contemplative beats. Occasional repetition of favored phrases skirts self-consciousness but generally reads as intentional motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits the fantastical archive setting and Elara’s reflective nature. Phrases like “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” and “softly deliberate” give the prose a recognizable texture without tipping into overwrought opacity. There is no POV leakage or confusing distance shift; interior access stays aligned with Elara. A touch less repetition of signature phrases would sharpen distinctiveness further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical register that suits Elara’s contemplative state and vocation. Diction is mostly within a believable range for a thoughtful wildlife handler, even if it occasionally edges toward generic inspirational prose. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and psychic distance stays reasonably close throughout. While the voice is competent and sometimes pleasing, it lacks the idiosyncratic sharpness that would fully distinguish it at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with Elara’s perceptions consistently shaping what we see. The voice has a lyrical bent (“meteor hush of the early morning,” “stone walls whispering secrets”) that mostly feels intentional and controlled rather than purple. There are occasional generalized abstractions and slightly elevated phrasing that smooth out her individuality, but they don’t cause confusion. Overall, the voice is pleasant and polished, if not yet strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and gently lyrical, with a steady focus on sensory detail and inner response. Phrases like “each step a whisper of history” and “like hushed thunder” give the narration a discernible texture without overwhelming clarity. Psychic distance is stable, and we don’t get head-hopping or register jolts. The prose is competent rather than singular; Elara’s perception doesn’t yet feel utterly unique in diction or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Lira’s cosmic preoccupations, with controlled elevated diction. Focalization stays cleanly with her perceptions, and the pattern of noticing (celestial, musical, numinous) gives a distinct perceptual signature. There are no POV breaches or register jolts. The rhythm can verge on uniform lushness, but it remains intelligible and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and occasionally striking (“a fractured lullaby,” “sparks of the unlit corners”), with consistent access to Mara’s perceptions. Diction remains within a coherent register, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few lines are slightly awkward or abstract (“her gaze occasionally everywhere”), and the voice sometimes slips into neutral fantasy-narrator rather than a particular mind. Still, control is solid and modulated enough to support the story’s lyric-leaning mode.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, gently elevated, and suited to a contemplative fable; it maintains consistent psychic distance around Eamon. Diction and syntax are controlled, with some nice rhythmic variations and imagistic flourishes. That said, the voice often feels generically “philosophical” rather than distinctly Eamon’s, and it tends toward abstraction in peak beats. There are no POV slips or major register clashes, but the perceptual signature could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct texture in its metaphors and cadence. The ferryman’s few lines of dialogue carry character and theme while sounding mostly natural within the heightened register. Occasional phrases (“shoreline lullaby,” “unused courage waits”) flirt with self-consciousness but don’t break the established tone. Overall, POV control and rhythm are strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and slightly archaic in a way that suits the contemplative, allegorical feel. Phrasing like “seraphically mundane” and “unpardonable silence” gives the prose a distinct texture without tipping into incoherence. At times the register drifts toward generalized abstraction instead of character-shaped perception, which flattens intensity. Overall, the voice is controlled and recognizable, if not yet idiosyncratic enough for top-tier distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable and confidently elevated, with consistent diction (“regally unpretentious,” “pause of shifting constellations”) that suits the quasi-mythic frame. POV control is clean; we remain inside Elara’s lens without leakage. Rhythm is generally well managed, with some nice cadences around key phrases. There is a faint sameness to the register across descriptive and peak moments, which flattens dynamic range slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and plausibly aligned with a reflective scientist; diction is elevated but not implausibly so. The narrative distance is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. While the voice is competent, it isn’t yet sharply idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring enough to feel unforgettable, but it would not embarrass itself in a high-level venue.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, readable, and occasionally striking (“thunderous serenity,” “margin of illumination before dusk fully claimed the sky”), with consistent focalization through Lira. The diction is gently lyrical without becoming opaque, and there’s no head-hopping or point-of-view confusion. Some turns of phrase feel familiar or generalized, but overall the voice has a coherent texture and an appropriate distance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, maintaining access to Mara’s perceptions without leaks. Prose has a gentle, mythic-lyric texture that suits an elder protagonist and a ritual scene, and diction remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the guard’s brief challenge feels natural if a bit generic. The voice is competent and pleasant rather than sharply distinctive at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is steady and coherent; Zara’s perceptions and knowledge limits are respected, and there is no head-hopping. The voice has some textural distinction in its sensory and atmospheric attentiveness. Still, moments of elevated, abstract diction (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism,” “legacy of resilience”) clash slightly with the otherwise embodied, lyrical tone, giving parts of the narration an essayistic feel rather than a fully character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and suitably lyrical, with a consistent filter through Elara’s sensibility as an artist. Diction and rhythm match the introspective, almost incantatory mode without slipping into overt abstraction. A few lines read as generic “lit-poetic” phrasing rather than idiosyncratically hers, slightly flattening the perceptual signature. Still, the POV control is solid and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and readable, with a gently lyrical texture that matches the contemplative tone. Dialogue is natural enough and serves plot and theme, though it occasionally lapses into essayistic exposition. The narrative diction is slightly generic for this world and character, without a sharply distinctive perceptual signature. Still, point of view remains stable and the modulation from descriptive calm to charged interiority at the vision beat is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and no head-hopping. The narrative voice is polished and mostly invisible, with a mild lyricism that suits the quiet setting. That said, the diction and rhythm are relatively conventional; they don’t fully capitalize on the oddness of a cryogenic library or the technical nature of dormant networks to give the voice a unique perceptual signature. There are no major register slips or awkward constructions, but also few lines whose turn of phrase feels unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and appropriate for a quiet, reflective piece, with some pleasing turns of phrase (“weave continuity through chaos,” “tranquil blaze of color and hope”). Dialogue is serviceable and natural enough, though it largely states intentions rather than carrying much subtext or distinctive idiom between Elara and Kael. POV remains stable with no head-hopping or confusing shifts. The voice is competent but not yet strikingly individual or rhythmically adventurous for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and consistent with a lyrical, contemplative mode, with clean control of distance and no head-hopping. Phrases like “transliterated into the language of the cosmos” and “feral lullaby” develop a recognizable texture, even if they verge on repetition. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the goddess’s brief speech has a slightly distinct timbre. The main limitation is that the narrative idiom feels somewhat generic-literary at points rather than sharply individualized to Kael’s particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with elevated but controlled diction that fits a literary-leaning piece and an educated protagonist. Interior access is consistent, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing leans generic or expository (e.g., “web of deceit that stretched far beyond the observatory”), which flattens what could be sharper, more character-colored observation. Overall, the POV control is professional, though not yet distinctive enough to stand out at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with recurring lexicon around sound, time, and starlight that feels unified. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unexplained access. A few abstractions (“old guilt,” “tragic mistake,” “source of the dissonance”) are slightly generic, but the overall perceptual signature—especially how she notices sounds and light—remains distinct. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction (“emergent hush,” “unlearning”) that matches the speculative-philosophical mode. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative distance stays controlled. There is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; even the grotto’s history is plausibly accessed via her experience of the mandala. A few abstract terms flirt with a more academic register, but they remain within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a lyrical but mostly clear narrative stance that fits the contemplative mode. Diction like “retrocognitively trapped” and “renaming their reality” leans abstract but remains internally coherent. The perceptual signature—Elara as someone who reads the world through symbols and moral concepts—comes through, though it risks homogeneity of tone. There is no dialogue to test range, but the POV control itself is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a theatrical, synesthetic ghost; diction and rhythm support the dreamlike, ritual atmosphere. POV control is steady with no head-hopping, and dialogue largely sounds natural within the heightened, mystical frame. At times, narrative lines veer into slightly generic fantasy-poetic constructions, diluting the distinctiveness of Mara’s specific sensibility. Overall, though, the voice feels confident and coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits Elara’s introspective, sensory-driven mindset. Diction like “somatic markers,” “fractally precise,” and “willowglass hope” feels coherent for this speculative-artistic world and contributes to a distinct texture. Psychic distance is managed well: we stay near her perceptions without slipping into omniscient commentary. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative rhythm and modulation through the night are confident.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with a mildly lyrical, straightforward narrative voice that fits the contemplative tone. Diction is consistent and accessible, without jarring register shifts or head-hopping. The voice, while competent, lacks a sharply distinctive rhythmic or idiomatic signature, especially in moments that should feel uncanny. Still, it maintains clarity and modest modulation as wonder builds around the fossil’s behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-ish lyric voice is stable and suits the contemplative, mystical register. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with a gentle cadence that fits the “unearthed silence” tone. There are moments of generic phrasing and slightly over-smooth exposition, but no real POV leakage or register clashes. Overall, the voice is competent and cohesive, if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the introspective, atmospheric mode, with a consistent perceptual texture. Diction is controlled and mostly aligned with Elara’s sensibility, and there are no POV slips or unjustified distance jumps. That said, the lyric register occasionally trends toward generalized poeticism rather than idiosyncratic, character-specific noticing. A few more surprising or personal turns of phrase could distinguish the voice further at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-but-formal voice is stable, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative frame. Diction (“spindrift serenity,” “percolate through the air”) is controlled and mostly consistent with the elevated register of a mythic parable. At times the narration feels more like an impersonal storyteller than a perspective saturated with the coachman’s particular sensibility, which mutes distinctiveness. Still, there are no POV slips or jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is calm, lucid, and steady, with a poetic but controlled diction that suits a “zen-minded” protagonist and contemplative premise. There’s a consistent perceptual signature—attention to light, pattern, and tactile craft—without head-hopping or register slips. At peak moments (the final alignment of patterns, the communal healing), the voice doesn’t significantly modulate to heighten urgency or complication, which keeps the piece feeling uniformly gentle. Still, it’s clean, coherent, and publishable in basic craft terms.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with no POV slippage. The diction is mostly consistent and suited to a reflective, quiet-night encounter. Dialogue is a bit polished and thematically explicit, but it remains plausible for the slightly heightened tone of the piece and advances the emotional stakes. There is a discernible texture to the narration, though not yet distinct enough to feel unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lucid, mildly elevated fantasy diction that suits the mythic setting. Sentences flow cleanly and maintain consistent psychic distance; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. While the voice is not especially idiosyncratic, it does have a recognizable texture (e.g., “tidal library,” “atomically reflective”) and modulates into slightly more charged rhythm at the orb sequence. Overall, it is controlled and publishable, if more polished than distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, fluent, and comfortably lyrical, with a consistent filter through Elara’s sensibility. Diction choices like “prismatic quiet,” “talisman,” and “keeper of secrets” establish a gentle, contemplative tone that fits the material. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the narrative stance is clear from start to finish. While the voice is not strikingly idiosyncratic, it is controlled and appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Prose is competent and readable but leans toward a generic elevated register that doesn’t feel especially idiosyncratic to her (“vast, unknowable cosmos,” “ethereal glow”). Dialogue is functional and distinguishes Hank’s brusqueness from Elara’s focus, but subtext is minimal. The voice supports the story but doesn’t yet feel singular or particularly textured under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitable, with a lyrical, slightly elevated register that fits the mythic-fantastical tone. Diction and syntax are mostly controlled, though there’s occasional drift into generic high-fantasy phrasing (“the veil between realms thinned,” “mysteries of spatial mutiny”) that blurs distinctiveness. Interior access is steady and believable, even if not deeply idiosyncratic to Elara specifically. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctness or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled diction and some nicely textured lines (“her mind worked like a clockwork mechanism”). POV access remains consistent and filtered through Elara’s sensibility without head-hopping or register shocks. Yet the narration often reads like a neutral literary voice rather than something distinctly hers; some phrasings feel generic or essayistic. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet singular or rhythmically surprising enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent register that balances atmospheric description and Elara’s interior experience. Diction (e.g., “unnatural chill,” “eerie resonance of broken machinery”) suits the speculative, gothic-tinged mood without slipping into jarring academic or clinical tones. While the prose isn’t stylistically daring, it’s controlled, and the focalization doesn’t leak beyond what Elara could directly perceive or infer. Under peak moments, the voice leans a bit generic instead of sharpening into a more idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent lyric register that fits Bridge-Song’s artistic sensibility. Phrases like “luminous disbelief” and “map of secrets” establish a poetic texture without breaking POV plausibility. However, the diction can blur into sameness—recycling “pixelated,” “sculpt possibility,” and “ashes of ‘never’”—which slightly flattens the perceptual signature. There is no dialogue to complicate distance or rhythm, which keeps things clean but limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent reflective distance. Diction is slightly elevated (“monument to failed ambition,” “dusky harmony”) but not implausible for the narrative stance; it does, however, tilt toward a generic literary register rather than a strongly individualized sensibility. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and a bit declarative, especially in Elias’s line to the partner about “leave the stories intact.” Overall, the voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a measured, lyrical tone that suits the contemplative, nocturnal setting. Diction is mostly consistent with an introspective, observatory-based chronicler, and the narrative distance doesn’t wobble. While the voice lacks a sharply distinctive idiom, it avoids major register clashes or head-hopping. The rhythm is relatively uniform, which keeps the piece smooth but slightly flattens moments that could carry more intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated fantasy diction that fits the material. Phrasing like “warlike serenity” and “frozen confession” provides some texture and patterning without sacrificing clarity. At times, the narration slips into generic thematic abstraction instead of a more idiosyncratic, character-specific register. Overall, the POV is stable and competent but not yet strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a lyrical-fantasy register that remains consistent from opening to closing. Some diction (“root-bound visionary,” “intersection of dreams,” “anxious elation”) is distinctive enough to gesture toward a particular sensibility, even if it risks feeling slightly generic-fantasy at times. There are no POV slips or intrusive exposition; distance and access remain controlled. What’s missing for higher bands is a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature or rhythmic daring under peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly aligned with Elara’s sensibility. Diction (“reckless idealist,” “fiercely gentle precision”) suits her temperament and the mythic tone of the setting. Dialogue is clean and functional, though often weighted toward thematic declaration rather than subtextual sparring, making the older self feel a bit didactic. Overall, the voice is polished and controlled, if occasionally more essayistic than character-bound in key lines.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and controlled, with a consistent reflective register that suits the introspective mode. Lexicon and stance are plausible for this character, and POV boundaries are clean. There are some nice rhythmic touches (“What was he supposed to do with it? With himself?”) and recurring diction around echo and insulation that create texture. Still, the voice often feels generically “literary” rather than distinctly Elias’s, and some phrasing leans on familiar constructions that dilute individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person close POV is steady and coherent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance fits the contemplative mode. The voice is clear and smooth, if somewhat generic for lyrical speculative fiction; it lacks a sharply distinctive idiom but avoids missteps. Diction is mildly elevated without straying into inappropriate abstraction for the character. Emotional modulation is gentle but consistent, tracking from quiet focus to wonder to calm fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and consistent with a meticulous, contemplative librarian; diction and metaphor choices support the fantastical register. Psychic distance is handled cleanly, with reflective passages anchored in concrete stimuli (runes, pool, orb). While distinct and pleasing, the voice rarely takes risks or sharp turns under pressure that would push it into truly standout territory.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person narration is stable and consistent, with a gently elevated, lyrical register that matches the mythic cave setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there’s no POV leakage or technical confusion. Still, the voice lacks strong idiosyncrasy; it feels like a competent, generalized fantasy lyricism rather than Elara’s uniquely skewed way of noticing. Under stress, the voice’s texture doesn’t notably sharpen or fracture, which keeps emotional intensity in a relatively narrow band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured lyricism that suits Elara’s reflective temperament and river-chronicler identity. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the few lines of dialogue sound natural while carrying thematic weight without feeling wholly contrived. The perceptual signature—attention to maps, currents, textures of decay—is distinct enough to feel character-specific. There are mild moments of generalized or therapy-adjacent phrasing, but they don’t significantly damage the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the fantastical setting. Diction and syntax are controlled and generally apt, with some nice rhythmic variation (“Its walls pulsed with an ethereal light, a beacon in the otherwise impenetrable fog”). The voice, while competent, doesn’t yet feel singular or idiosyncratic; it could belong to many genre pieces of this type. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and elision is minimal and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with lush, lyrical diction that fits the slightly surreal, high-concept frame and Elara’s introspective temperament. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and the narrative modulation from contemplative to climactic and back is smooth. Occasional abstract formulations slightly distance us from her embodied experience, but they don’t break POV credibility. Overall, the voice feels controlled, confident, and distinct enough for an upper-tier submission.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical register that matches Elara’s attentiveness and the grotto’s hush. Diction and rhythm are controlled and readable without head-hopping or register shocks. The traveler’s brief speech has a slightly generalized, aphoristic quality, but it doesn’t break the POV or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and suitably lyrical for the contemplative fantasy mode, with recurring phrases like “vineyard hush” and “umbral grotto” giving it texture. POV control is clean; we stay inside Elara’s perception, and the brief dialogue with the moon-eyed woman does not cause any focalization slippage. At times, the diction leans toward generic spiritual-register abstractions (“cycle of rebirth,” “source of contentment”) that flatten what could be a more idiosyncratic voice. Still, the stance is steady and professional, with few technical missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close around Elias is steady and coherent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits the contemplative frame. The narrative voice maintains a calm, contemplative cadence that aligns with his role as a “conscience for hire.” There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the modulation from observation to insight is smooth. What’s missing at a higher level is a more distinctive perceptual signature—Elias’s way of noticing feels competent but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative, speculative atmosphere. Diction like “sycamore hush,” “carefully woven,” and “weight of her mission” coheres tonally, even if it occasionally verges on the generic-poetic. POV boundaries are respected; we never leave Elara’s perspective, and reflective passages are clearly anchored to present cues (stones, water, grotto hum). Some sentences risk a uniform elevated register, but overall the voice feels controlled rather than inflated.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the contemplative, mythic tone of the piece. Phrasing like “navigate without moving” and “pulse left wandering through the air” builds a recognizable texture without major register slips. At times, the diction defaults to familiar elevated abstractions (“weight of history,” “hidden truths”), which slightly blurs the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Still, control of distance and consistency of stance remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is competent but fairly generic high-fantasy exposition, with occasional awkward coinages (“sea of brilliance dimness”) that feel more decorative than voice-specific. Narrative distance remains consistent, though it tends to explain states rather than filter them through idiosyncratic perception. There’s little distinctive rhythm or lexical signature to make Eli’s consciousness feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-controlled, with a consistent calm, hushed register that matches Elias’s temperament and the scene. Phrases like “meteor hush” and “a meteor hush that seemed to cradle the world in its palm” give the prose a recognizable texture. At times the diction drifts toward generic fantasy abstraction (“enigmatic pull,” “something greater”), which slightly blurs the otherwise distinct atmosphere. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent slightly-lyric, elevated register that fits the cosmic setting. Some phrases and images are fresh, and the prose occasionally finds a nice rhythm around the machine and essence. There is, however, a tendency toward abstract, similar-sounding formulations (“whispered secrets in static bursts,” “stellar doubt,” “wavelength align with purpose”) that blur into one another rather than sharpening Lira’s particular mind. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinct or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a gently elevated diction that suits the mythic tone and never breaks POV constraints. Phrasing like “distant intimacy” between Elara and the echoes is effectively embedded in the narrative texture rather than feeling imported. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the lyricism generally supports mood without obscuring sense. While the voice is strong and coherent, it doesn’t yet have quite the idiosyncratic sharpness that would make it unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that matches the quasi-mythic tone. Phrasing like “plausible impossibility” and “cosmic imbalance” skirts abstraction but generally fits the story’s fable-like stance. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage; interior and external description blend smoothly. The voice is competent and occasionally graceful, though not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and well-controlled, with a consistent mildly elevated lyric register that suits the contemplative tone. Diction like “precisely humane,” “mirrored hush,” and “Resonant resurfacing” feels unified rather than patchwork. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays comfortably close to Elias without over-explaining. The drawback is a certain sameness of cadence and an almost uniformly solemn register that leaves little modulation as stakes shift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, grammatically clean, and capable of lyric description, with no POV slippage or confusing stance shifts. Diction suits a quiet, wonder-filled fantasy but feels fairly generic, lacking a sharply individualized perceptual signature for Elara. There are no major register clashes or “helpful narrator” intrusions; the narration mostly stays close to her. The rhythmic control is competent, though often uniform, with many similarly cadenced, descriptive sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate to a mythic/lyric mode, with consistent elevated diction and no POV leakage. The prose has some rhythmic variation and recurring phrasal patterns that suit the meditative tone, if a bit uniform. However, the narrative idiom is fairly generic for this register; it lacks a sharply individual perceptual signature that would distinguish this seeker from any other solemn fantasy guardian. No dialogue appears, so there’s no test of spoken voice or subtext in conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person with a consistent, slightly elevated mystical register that fits the setting. The narrative voice is competent but somewhat generic, leaning on familiar genre formulations rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal yet serviceable, mostly expository statements from Lira without much subtext. There are no glaring distance slips or head-hopping, but the voice rarely surprises or deepens character beyond the conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with mildly elevated diction that suits a contemplative, puzzle-loving protagonist. Phrasing like “storm-born silence” and “orthogonal approaches” gives the narration a faintly cerebral, atmospheric flavor without breaking POV plausibility. There are a few generic beats (“his heart pounding,” “his mind already flowing with theories and plans”), but they don’t dominate. Overall, the voice is coherent and controlled, if not especially idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and cohesive, with a consistent lyrical register that fits the surreal conceit. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and psychic distance remains stable; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. While distinctive, the voice is more generally poetic than sharply idiosyncratic to Eli’s particular mind. Even so, the modulation from hushed anticipation to insistent crescendo to quiet aftermath is handled with confident tonal control.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the dreamlike setting, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Elara’s perception has a recognizable texture, and the narration doesn’t claim knowledge beyond her perspective. Dialogue is functional and clear, though the keeper’s lines lean toward generic portentousness rather than idiosyncratic speech. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but stops short of being strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently elevated, lyrical register that suits the material and stays within plausible bounds for the character. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly free of jarring shifts; key objects and images are returned to with deliberate emphasis. At times the narration slides into generalized, high-concept language (“method of successive approximation,” “core concept of creative destruction”) that feels more essayistic than character-particular. Still, focalization is clear and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and appropriate for a contemplative SF/fantasy vignette, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and thoughts. Diction is elevated but not jarringly so, and the lyricism aligns with the cosmic, mystical subject matter. That said, the voice feels somewhat generic for the subgenre, with familiar constructions (“song older than the city itself,” “grand symphony,” “infinite potential”) rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature. No POV slippage or technical issues interfere with comprehension or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative stance fits a slightly elevated, mythic-fantasy register without serious leakage. Sentence rhythms are varied enough, and brief dialogue (“Then I’ll find a way to outlast them”) feels natural within the heightened tone. Mara’s perceptual signature is competent but not especially idiosyncratic; much of the diction could belong to any capable genre narrator. Still, the voice remains coherent under pressure and avoids confusing shifts in distance or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a controlled, mildly lyrical register that fits the surreal setting (e.g., “rational enchantment,” “realistically imaginary”). Elara’s perceptual focus on pattern, light, and structure aligns with her identity as an architect of illusions, giving the narration some character-specific tilt. The brief telepathic dialogue with the shadow man is clean and functional, adding pressure without breaking POV control. While effective, the voice feels polished rather than singularly idiosyncratic or unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and stable, with a mildly lyrical texture that suits the speculative setting. Elara’s perceptions are plausibly colored by her navigational expertise, and Kael’s dialogue is distinct enough in register and function. There are no POV slips or confusing psychic-distance jumps. While the voice is polished, it doesn’t yet feel startlingly singular or idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    The close-third voice is stable, readable, and consistent, with a gently lyrical texture that fits the premise. Diction occasionally drifts into generic poeticism and repetition (“reeling hush,” “vulnerable voices,” “profound discoveries”), which makes the voice feel less singular and more workshop-familiar. POV control is solid; we never leave Elara’s perspective or slip in distance without cause. Rhythm is competent but not especially distinctive or sharpened at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-calibrated to Elena’s perceptions, with a steady lyric undercurrent. Repeated phrases like “crashing hush” and some stock constructions slightly dilute distinctiveness but don’t break control. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from tense descent to calmer, reflective surface read is smooth. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative, though not yet singular enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and well matched to a solitary, cerebral protagonist in a cold observatory. Diction is generally consistent, with a nice balance of concrete detail and gentle lyricism (“swirling like galaxies in miniature,” “screens flickering with lines of code that danced like fireflies”). There are a few moments of generic phrasing or slight register flatness, but no serious POV leakage or clumsy exposition. Rhythm and sentence variety are solid, supporting atmosphere and interiority without calling undue attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a mythic, slightly elevated diction that suits the fantastical setting. Lira’s perspective colors what we notice—echoes, texture, and birds—and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The rhythmic control is competent, though the narrative idiom could be more idiosyncratically hers rather than generically “lyric fantasy.” Overall, the voice is clear and appropriate but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and coherent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice has a consistent lush, slightly gothic-mystical register that fits the material. However, diction sometimes lapses into generalized lyricism (“frostbitten hope,” “harmony untamed”) that feels more authorial than Lena-specific. The rare dialogue lines are functional but not especially textured or revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with lyrical tendencies that suit the fantastical setting and Elara’s artistic perspective. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. While the prose is pleasant and occasionally striking, the narrative texture could be more idiosyncratic to Elara specifically; it feels like well-crafted genre-lyric rather than a singularly unmistakable voice. Still, it’s strong, clean, and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyric-leaning texture that fits the quasi-fabulist premise. Phrasing like “brittle hush of twilight” and “thunderstorm in a bottle” gives the piece a recognizable sonic signature. Occasionally the diction lapses into slightly generic inspirational registers (“delivering hope,” “a chance”) that dilute distinctiveness. Overall, POV handling is clean, with no leakage or artificial exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close-ish voice is steady, clear, and lyrically inclined; diction is appropriate and consistent. The prose has some rhythmic variety and recurring phrase-work (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) that gives it a recognizable texture without confusion. At times, the narration adopts a slightly generic, fable-like register that smooths over individual quirk in the carpenter’s perception. There is no dialogue to test modulation, but the POV remains coherent and free of head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and mostly well-matched to both the conceptual and the tactile elements (“labyrinth of whispers,” “bound ideas,” “kaleidoscope of words and images”). Diction is consistent with a reflective, slightly elevated narrative stance and doesn’t drift into jarring registers. There’s not a strong, idiosyncratic verbal signature, but the modulation of rhythm and focus as the ritual intensifies is controlled and clear. With no dialogue to test distinct voices, the POV still feels coherent and confidently handled.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the dreamy, contemplative subject matter. Diction and imagery (“whispering archipelago,” “painting with light,” “cipher of longing”) establish a consistent, recognizable texture. The register occasionally leans generic-literary rather than distinctly Elara-specific, and there are few surprising turns of phrase that would mark an unmistakable signature. Nonetheless, POV control is clean and modulation across the scene is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, with diction that matches the slightly elevated, mythic tone. There are no head-hops or stance breaks, and the narrative confidently inhabits Elara’s perceptions. Some phrasing leans generic or abstract, but overall the voice maintains a coherent texture of hushed wonder. Modulation under pressure is gentle but present, especially as she approaches and addresses the orb.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV is steady and reliable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative maintains a consistent, mildly lyrical register. Elara’s perceptual lens is present but not deeply idiosyncratic; much of the diction could belong to any competent fantasy narrator. Repetitions like “Decades later” and some template cadences slightly blunt distinctiveness. Voice is clean and serviceable for publication, but not yet singular or arresting at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the fantastical-archival premise. Diction like “combative tenderness” and “reversible exile” has a distinct texture without drifting into academic or corporate jargon. There’s a steady psychic distance; we stay inside Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. A few phrases slide toward generic lyricism, but overall the perceptual signature feels unified and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently elevated, and in keeping with a mythic or fable-like register. Phrases like “weaver between worlds” and “radiant hush” build a recognizable lyrical texture, though they trend toward generalized abstraction rather than sharply character-specific noticing. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion, but the diction sometimes feels more like an impersonal narrator than Elara’s particular mind. The voice is competent and pleasant, but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, mystical subject matter, with controlled syntax and consistent diction. Elara’s perceptual focus on textures, light, and sound (or its absence) gives the narration a recognizable signature. There are occasional tendencies toward repetition of favored phrases and abstractions, but they don’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, grammatically clean, and maintains a coherent elevated register suited to quasi-mystical archaeology. POV control is solid, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. However, the narrative idiom is fairly generic for this mode—few turns of phrase feel unmistakably Elara’s, and diction could belong to any earnest genre-fantasy narrator. Rhythm is competent but not especially distinctive or risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, calm, and gently lyrical, matching Elara’s analytic temperament and the story’s reflective mode. Diction is consistent and plausible for a thoughtful scientist without sliding into clinical or academic register. The piece maintains a stable psychic distance, interleaving observation and interior reflection smoothly. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell, though the voice could risk a touch more idiosyncrasy to feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-controlled, with phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “ghost in the code” giving it a distinctive texture. POV distance is consistent; we stay close to Elara’s perceptions without unmotivated omniscience or head-hopping. The rhythm and diction match the quasi-mythic, tech-fantasy tone without sliding into academic or clunky registers. It does not quite reach the virtuosity where every sentence cuts new facets, but the voice feels intentional and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and mostly well-matched to the introspective, gently fantastical material. Diction and rhythm are competent but not particularly distinctive; this could be almost any earnest fantasy narrator. There are no POV slips or register jolts, but the voice rarely surprises or deepens character beyond what the plot already signals.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a consistent filter through Elara’s professional and emotional lens. Phrasing like “quietly explosive” and “spooled wholeness” show some textural ambition without veering into total opacity. At times the diction becomes slightly generic or declarative in key moments (“She knew what she had to do”; “She had proven her theory”), which flattens the otherwise distinctive feel. Overall, POV control is solid and free of technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the quasi-mythic tone, with phrases like “fractally precise detail” and “mirror the sky inside walls” giving it texture. The perceptual filter—obsessed with minutiae, indifferent to faces—feels character-specific and lends an identifiable signature. There are no POV slips or stance confusions. The voice is strong and polished but not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady and appropriate, with a mildly ornate, atmospheric diction that suits the fantastical airship setting. POV is consistent through Elara, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience. While the narrative texture is competent and occasionally lovely (“stranded luminance, suspended in crystalline orbs”), it doesn’t yet feel sharply idiosyncratic or risk-taking. Dialogue is minimal but functional and in character.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the fantasy ambiance. Diction and syntax are controlled, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach what Elara could plausibly perceive. At times the lyricism edges toward sameness in cadence and imagery, blurring the distinctness of her perceptual “signature” beyond a generalized poetic sensibility. Still, the voice is polished and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable and mildly lyrical, with consistent diction and no POV confusion; the omniscient tilt fits the fairy-tale mode. Phrases like “brambled hope” and “waterfall of stars” create a recognizable texture without becoming completely overwrought. At times the narration leans toward generalized prettiness rather than a sharply character-filtered perception, so the voice feels more authorial than deeply tied to Kael or Elara. Still, it’s controlled, readable, and tonally appropriate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and colored by Elara’s sensibility, with recurring diction around hush, bruises, and lullabies. Rhythm and syntax are controlled and modulate appropriately with pressure; the voice never breaks into incongruent registers. There is no POV slippage or head-hopping, and interior access feels stable. Occasional phrases flirt with over-artful abstraction, but they don’t undermine clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a consistent perceptual signature that marries mechanical and organic imagery (“beauty born of function rather than intent,” “offhandedly exact”). Diction is elevated but coherent with the mythic-fantastical register and doesn’t jar against Elara’s perspective. Psychic distance is steady, and there’s no head-hopping. Occasionally the narration edges toward authorial summary (especially in the final paragraph’s purpose-claim), which slightly mutes the otherwise strong textural voice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, mildly lyrical register that fits an analytical, reflective protagonist. Scientific and musical metaphors sit comfortably in the diction and don’t break POV plausibility. At the same time, the voice feels somewhat “standard literary” rather than distinctly idiosyncratic to Elena; it could plausibly belong to many thoughtful narrators. Good control, but not a standout, unmistakable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and suits the fable-like, lyrical mode, with no POV leakage or tense slips. Diction choices (“quantifying absence,” “glimmering parole”) build a consistent conceptual idiom. However, the narrator’s texture is more generically poetic than sharply individual to Elara’s mind, so the perceptual signature blurs into authorial. There’s good control, but little surprise in rhythm or phrasing at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with consistent distance and no head-hopping; it sustains a contemplative, slightly mythic register that suits the material. Elara’s way of noticing—translating patterns and surfaces into “stories” and “flavors”—gives the narration a mild perceptual signature. The diction is occasionally generic-lyric (“forgotten secrets,” “unspoken dream”) rather than sharply idiosyncratic to her. Overall, though, stance and rhythm are steady and clear across the story and through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and comfortably lyrical, matching the fable-like intent. Diction such as “borrowed starlight” and “bridges stretched endlessly” sets a clear tonal register, though it risks generic prettiness at times. POV control is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance stays steady. What’s missing for higher scores is a more idiosyncratic, character-specific perceptual signature that would make the voice unmistakably Elara’s.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits Elara’s reflective, scientific-poetic mind. Phrases like “quaking reverie of uncertainty” and “archeologist of abandoned dreams” give the piece a recognizable texture without major POV leakage. At times, the diction drifts toward generalized abstraction (“air was thick with change,” “fabric of reality was being rewritten”), dulling the individuality of her perception. Overall, the voice is coherent and competent but not yet singular or surprising enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, and the mildly elevated diction suits a mystical fantasy register. Phrases like “prism-minded archivist” and “latent blaze” give a hint of texture, but Elara’s perceptual signature doesn’t fully differentiate her from a generic careful protagonist. Narrative distance is handled cleanly with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall, the voice is competent and consistent, but not yet distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriate to a meditative, art-focused narrative. Syntax and diction are consistent and often pleasing, with musical metaphors (“each fracture a note in a forgotten symphony”) that echo the premise. At times, the voice veers toward generic lyricism and repetition, softening the individuality of Elara’s perceptual signature. Even so, POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, reflective cadence that fits Alara’s temperament and the contemplative scene. Diction (“magnetic nexus,” “eclipsed covenant,” “translate silence”) is consistent with a slightly elevated, quasi-mythic register without noticeable head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the voice rarely surprises; it doesn’t yet carry the idiosyncratic edges or rhythmic daring that would distinguish it in a prestige market. Competent, smooth, and coherent rather than truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a calm, ritualistic cadence that suits Elara’s sensibility and the contemplative scene. Diction like “tuning her frequencies” and “theatrical sincerity” feels character-specific rather than generic, and there’s no POV slippage. At times the register drifts toward abstract or lofty phrasing that flattens immediacy, but not enough to break the spell. Overall, the voice is distinctive and controlled, even if a bit uniform in tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, gently lyrical register well-suited to a contemplative fantasy vignette. Word choice and rhythm are reasonably distinctive without slipping into incoherence or head-hopping. At times the narration feels more like a high-level storyteller than fully embodied Elara, but the distance is consistent enough to feel intentional. There’s room for a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature, yet the current voice is solid and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, clear, and appropriate to the genre, with controlled descriptive language and no POV slippage. The diction is elevated but consistent, avoiding register shocks. Still, the voice feels somewhat interchangeable with other polished SF-narrative voices; Elara’s perceptual biases or idiosyncrasies don’t strongly color the prose. Rhythm is generally smooth, though it leans toward uniformly lyrical rather than modulating sharply with moments of danger or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and modest in scope, with no head-hopping or stance drift. The voice has some texture—“guts of a giant,” “ghostly maze,” “hazy precision”—but it is more generally atmospheric than strongly idiosyncratic to Elara as a character. Explanatory passages about the storm and funnel effect stay within a plausible register for a technically minded investigator. Overall, the narrative stance is controlled and serviceable, if not particularly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a lyrical-but-controlled register that fits the mystical setting and Elara’s synesthetic mind. Diction choices like “sculpted hush,” “liquid sunlight,” and “oscillating repose” give the prose a recognizable texture. POV distance and knowledge remain stable; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. At times the narration leans into abstract phrasing (“presence of possibility”) that slightly flattens immediacy, but it doesn’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is steady and consistent, with no leaks or head-hopping. The narrative voice is competent and readable, occasionally elevated (“avalanchingly quiet,” “where the sky seemed to crackle with unseen energy”) but not distinctively idiosyncratic to Elara. Diction remains mostly uniform and conventional, giving the piece a slightly generic fantasy-register feel. There’s enough control to support the story, but not yet a memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly archaic lyricism that suits Elias’s obsessive, mystical mindset. Phrases like “lucid turbulence” and “mathematics of emotion” give the narration a recognizable texture, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register leans into generalized poetic diction (“complex tapestry,” “essence,” “conduit”) that could belong to many narrators, softening the distinctiveness. The voice is competent and occasionally striking, but not yet singular or rhythmically daring enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable, with consistent access to her perceptions and a generally controlled, lyric-leaning narrative voice. Prose rhythm is smooth, but the voice is not particularly idiosyncratic; many sentences could belong to any competent fantasy vignette. Dialogue is functional yet plain, with the scholar’s lines delivering information directly rather than working much in implication. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, but the piece lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and suitably elevated for a mystic without drifting into abstraction. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a gentle lyricism that matches the subject matter and never breaks POV logic. While the voice is pleasant and coherent, it doesn’t yet have a sharply distinctive or surprising texture that would make it unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a clear tilt toward mythic-fantasy diction that suits the premise. Syntax is varied enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance stays coherent without head-hopping. Some phrases verge on the generic-poetic (“tapestry of time itself,” “bridge of light”), but the overall texture feels controlled rather than florid. There’s a distinct, if familiar, gentle-fable register that carries through to the close.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is clear, consistent, and slightly elevated without slipping into academic or corporate registers. Diction choices like “meek blacksmith,” “magician’s silk,” and “azure defiance” give the prose a mild mythic flavor that fits the premise. POV distance is steady and modestly close to Eli without leaks, though interior access could be deeper, particularly in perilous moments. Rhythm is competent but not especially distinctive; there are some nice turns of phrase, but little that feels formally daring or unmistakably idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, and the prose is clear and readable throughout. Some phrasing (“murmur of half-remembered dreams,” “pulsed with a quiet energy”) gestures toward a lyrical texture without losing legibility. However, Elara’s narrative voice is fairly generic speculative-fiction diction rather than a sharply individuated sensibility; her interior language could belong to many genre protagonists. Dialogue is sparse but functional, without notable subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mild lyrical tilt that fits Elias’s inwardness and observational nature. Diction and syntax are consistent and accessible, and the narrative generally respects what he can perceive and infer. There are a few generic formulations (“he was determined to figure it out”; “it was all connected”) that flatten the otherwise distinct texture. Overall, the POV control is clean and functional, if not particularly idiosyncratic at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and well-suited to a mythic-fantasy vignette, with phrases like “sword of light” and “shadowed elation” establishing texture. Psychic distance stays consistent and focused on the Herald, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. There is some repetition of construction and explanatory phrasing (“They understood. This was no accident.”) that feels prosy rather than embodied. Overall, though, the voice is coherent and controlled, if not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a calm, lyrical cadence suited to the contemplative tone, and the sensory diction (jasmine, amber and gold, iridescence) feels unified. Dialogue is mostly natural if slightly polished, and it does advance the scene’s emotional arc. At peak beats, the narration edges toward generic quasi-spiritual phrasing (“meant to be shared,” “illuminate the path for others”) that blurs character-specific voice into authorial commentary. Still, overall control of POV and rhythm is solid and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, fantastical premise. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with some pleasing phrases and a clear focalization through Elias’s perceptions. At times the register slides into generic abstraction and thesis-like sentences that feel more like an authorial overlay than Elias’s consciousness. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation between description and reflection remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the fable-like material, with consistent diction and no POV slippage. Sentences have a smooth cadence, and the narrative stance doesn’t over-explain beyond what suits the mythic tone. That said, the voice feels somewhat generic-high-fantasy rather than sharply individuated to Elara’s particular mind. There’s little modulation in texture or rhythm at peak beats, so emotional spikes don’t gain much extra charge from prose shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited voice around Elara is generally steady, and the contemplative tone holds from start to finish. Some lines are nicely textured, but others feel awkward or over-elevated (“a whisper of enlarged tranquility”) and expository dialogue carries theme a bit too directly. POV control is fine—no head-hopping or stance confusion—but the narrative idiom could be more distinctly Elara’s rather than a generalized lyrical register. Overall, it’s competent but not yet distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gentle, reflective cadence that suits Elara’s sensibility and the story’s meditative mode. Diction is mostly controlled and precise, with some nice phrasings like “heuristically gentle” hinting at a distinct cast of mind. At times the narration drifts toward generic lyrical prose and summary of feelings rather than sharply idiosyncratic perception. Overall, voice is competent and appropriate but not yet distinctive enough for an elite literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, polished, and tonally appropriate—elevated and slightly archaic without slipping into self-parody. Diction (“quartz hush,” “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) gives the prose a distinct texture that matches the fantastical setting and Elara’s reverent stance. There are no POV leaks or stance confusions, and the narrative distance is well regulated, though the lyric register occasionally flattens emotional immediacy into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Prose has a consistent, moderately lyrical texture that fits the slightly fantastical noir tone. Dialogue is functional and mostly natural, though often on-the-nose in stating stakes and theme (“when it disappeared, so did the trust”). Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV on Elara is stable and coherent, and the lyrical register matches the fantastical setting. Her perceptual filter—attention to taste, light, and subtle shifts in air—gives the narration some character-specific texture. Dialogue is grammatically clean but a bit formal and expository, with both speakers tending toward the same elevated diction. The voice is pleasant and consistent, though not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-calibrated, with some strong, image-driven phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “charcoal-fingered”). Interiority and description share a consistent lyrical register that fits the piece’s aims. Occasionally the diction drifts toward purple or generic abstraction, but not so much that it undercuts coherence or credibility of POV. Overall, the voice feels controlled and publishable, if not yet distinctive enough to stand out at the very highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a restrained lyricism that fits the speculative setting and Elara’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and generally avoid register clashes; interior access is smooth without head-hopping. There are no dialogue demands here, and psychic distance remains coherent as tension rises and falls. While the voice is not radically distinctive, it’s solid and confident enough for immediate readability in a competitive market.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent, hushed register that matches the premise. Diction occasionally drifts into generic pseudo-mystical phrasing (“frozen tears of the gods,” “essence of truth”) but not so far as to break the stance. There is no dialogue to test range, yet the narrative perspective on Elara is steady and free of head-hopping. Overall, the voice is pleasant and competent, though not yet distinct enough to feel singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and appropriate to an introspective android, with a measured, slightly formal diction that fits the quasi-poetic sci-fi tone. Phrases like “took a deep, unnecessary breath” nicely fuse machine logic with human mimicry. There is some repetition of key adjectives and abstractions (“strangely organic,” “fragmented wholeness,” “static”) that begins to feel like scaffolding rather than a fully distinctive idiom. Still, POV control is clean and the narrative stance remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and gently lyrical, with atmospheric openings like “The first light of dawn painted the vibrant courtyard in hues of gold and amber.” Dialogue between Clara and Mrs. Ellis reads natural enough and efficiently carries information and theme. Some diction leans slightly generic or sentimental, but the overall narrative stance is controlled and appropriate to the material. There is no head-hopping or register clash; the modulation from curiosity to quiet revelation is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a smooth, elevated diction that matches the mythic, underwater-laboratory conceit. Narrative distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. While the voice does not feel radically idiosyncratic, it has a recognizable rhythm and control, especially in the descriptive passages and the dance sequence. At times it leans toward familiar turns of phrase that keep it from feeling utterly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person narration is stable, with a consistent, slightly lyrical register that fits the speculative, quiet tone. Diction is generally precise and evocative without heavy register clashes, and the focalization stays anchored in Eli’s perceptions. Some phrasing choices (“What happened next was beyond description”) feel like generic narrator shortcuts that break immediacy at the key turn. Overall, the voice is pleasant and controlled but not yet singular or idiosyncratic enough for elite literary distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and well-suited to a contemplative ritual scene. Diction is consistently elevated but not jarringly out of register for this sort of fantasy-lyric stance. While the narrative texture is competent and at times graceful, it doesn’t yet have a sharply distinctive, character-specific signature beyond familiar fantasy lyricism. There are no POV slips or stance confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice around Clara is stable, clear, and suits the slightly lyrical, contemplative mode. Elias’s dialogue has a distinct cadence—measured, enigmatic—which contrasts with Clara’s more straightforward speech and questions. The prose occasionally edges toward authorial/philosophical register through Elias, but this is justified by his role and doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice is controlled and coherent, if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly ornate, and consistent with a contemplative fantasy vignette. The figure’s dialogue is clear and functional, though it drifts into thesis-delivery rather than character-specific speech. Phrases like “core concept,” “resonance structures,” and “translated, turned into something new” occasionally slip into abstract or slightly technical register that doesn’t quite match the rest of the lyrical tone. Overall, the POV control is solid but the voice is more pleasant than distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the sacred, introspective setting. Sentences have a readable cadence and some distinct turns of phrase (“calibrated treason,” “a tool of unmaking”), and the narrative distance remains stable. Occasionally the diction lapses into generic abstractions (“act of liberation,” “felt alive with possibility”) that flatten the otherwise strong texture. Overall, the POV is well-handled and coherent, if not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and comfortably lyrical, with consistent diction around starlight, whispers, and hums. Elara’s perceptual bias is present but not especially distinctive; many phrases feel like genre-standard mystic fantasy rather than an inimitable consciousness. Dialogue is functional and clear but largely expository, especially the figure’s explanations about echoes. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice doesn’t yet rise to a memorable, signature rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close POV is stable and well controlled, with no head-hopping and consistent access to Elara’s perceptions. The voice has a soft, lyrical texture that suits the material, though it sometimes leans on familiar turns of phrase rather than an utterly idiosyncratic idiom. Rhythms are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the descriptive mode is legible and confident. It’s a pleasant, controlled voice more than a singularly arresting one.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, calm, and suitably contemplative, with some nice idiosyncratic touches (e.g., “net-mender philosopher,” “moon paths”). Syntax and diction are controlled and consistent with the quiet, reflective stance. The voice, though pleasant, does not yet feel utterly singular, and at times slides into generic elevated phrasing rather than a sharply personal idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and coherent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice is competent and occasionally striking (“a jagged shard of light,” “excavate truth from the comfortable lies”) but overall hews to a familiar speculative-fantasy register without a strongly individual rhythm. Expository passages about the stillpoint and scientists verge on neutral summary rather than fully colored through Elara’s sensibility. Under stress, the voice remains clear but doesn’t notably sharpen or distort in a character-specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent slightly-elevated, lyrical register that suits the visionary-prophet frame. Phrasing like “gritty whimsy” and “variant allegiance” gives the voice some texture without breaking clarity. There is little dialogue, but what appears (the voice’s lines) is distinct and functional. At times the narration slips into generalized exposition, but control of distance and tense remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Elias’s sensibility, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature (sound-obsessed, tender, slightly archaic). Sentences vary in rhythm and length, sustaining the “lonesome splendor” tone without obvious register clashes. Interior access feels appropriate and never leaks into omniscient commentary. The one minor limitation is a small reliance on familiar formulations (“positively wistful expression”) that slightly flatten an otherwise distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and keeps us anchored in Elara’s perceptions and reasoning. Diction is generally controlled, with a slightly elevated, lyrical register that matches the speculative tone without major register slips. Dialogue is functional and clear, if a bit declarative and archetypal (“The world is out of tune”). The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular or unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and free of head-hopping, and it carries the contemplative tone reliably. Nonetheless, the diction is fairly generic, with repeated constructions and abstractions that could fit many similar pieces, so Elara’s perceptual signature never fully sharpens. The narrative distance remains consistent but rarely modulates in a way that heightens key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, maintaining Elara’s observational stance throughout. The prose has moments of texture (“shadows that seemed to reverberate with whispers of the past”), though often leans on familiar formulations (“web of corruption and neglect,” “true motivation ran deeper”). There’s little sense of a singular, idiosyncratic voice; the diction could fit many investigators in many settings. Nonetheless, control is competent and free of major slips in distance or register.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person-limited POV on Elias is stable and consistent, with a measured, mildly elevated narrative voice that suits the contemplative mood. Alistair’s dialogue slips toward aphorism, but it maintains a distinct cadence compared to Elias’s more subdued narration. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. The voice is competent and occasionally graceful, though it lacks a strongly distinctive idiolect that would make it unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent mildly ornate, quasi-scientific-fantastical register that fits the premise. There are some nicely textured phrases, but also a few generic locutions (“steadily curious mind,” “irreverently in awe of the universe’s absurdity”) that blunt distinctiveness. POV control is clean—no head-hopping, no implausible knowledge claims. Overall the voice serves the story competently but doesn’t yet feel singular or sharpened under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close POV is stable and coherent, with clean tense control and no head-hopping, and the narrative stance matches the investigative SF mode. The voice has occasional pleasing turns (“the archive’s forgotten corners,” “sensed absence”) but overall feels fairly generic and expository rather than sharply character-specific. There is little rhythmic daring or distinct perceptual signature, and the lack of dialogue limits opportunities for textural variation. Competent but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and controlled, with a gentle, elevated lyricism that suits the material and never breaks POV boundaries. Diction is mostly consistent with a quiet fantasy register, and there’s no head-hopping or tense drift. The perceptual signature is competent but not especially idiosyncratic; it feels like a well-made narrative voice rather than something unmistakably Elara-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a gently lyrical register that suits Elara’s sensibility and the frozen setting. Dialogue is clean and functional, though often straightforward in carrying theme rather than subtext. The narrative diction (“a fold in patience,” “windborne solace”) provides some distinct texture without losing clarity. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice could risk stranger, more character-particular perceptions to stand out in a top-tier literary field.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, readable, and appropriately lyric for the contemplative mode. Elara’s perceptions of the vineyard and pavilion are consistently filtered through a reflective, almost essayistic sensibility that fits her introspective role. At times, the diction drifts into abstract or academic registers (“intersubjective understanding,” “nurturer of connections”) that feel more like authorial commentary than her lived language. Still, POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, grammatically clean, and suited to the quasi-mystical setting, with a measured, lyrical rhythm that fits the calm tone. Diction is mostly controlled and coherent with the world; there’s no head-hopping or POV leakage. At times the register leans toward generalized abstraction (“essence of ancient conjurings,” “echo of wisdom”) rather than sharply character-particular noticing, which slightly blurs Elara’s distinctiveness. Still, the prose stance and psychic distance are stable and competent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and closely aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is gently lyrical and consistent, favoring flowing sentences that match the contemplative mode. However, the diction and rhythms, while pleasant, are not especially idiosyncratic to Elara; another reflective protagonist could plausibly sound similar. There is little modulation in voice under different emotional pressures because true pressure rarely arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, suitably close, and maintains a measured, contemplative register that fits the scholar and concept. Diction and syntax are competent and occasionally elegant, with some pleasing cadences. That said, the voice could be more idiosyncratic to Elias—at times it reads like a generalized literary narrator rather than a distinct mind’s texture. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies that disturb clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is steady, sensuous, and suitably lyrical, with imagery that feels filtered through Elias’s contemplative mindset. Diction is consistent and avoids register clashes; the narrative distance stays intimate without omniscient leakage. Rhythms vary well between longer, foggy sentences and cleaner, concrete actions (kneeling, drawing lines, placing driftwood). The voice has enough idiosyncratic texture (e.g., “precognitively forgetful,” “clinging to echoes of conversations he’d never had”) to stand out without calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suitably elevated, matching Elara’s contemplative, almost monastic focus on time and instruments. Diction is consistent and mostly character-plausible for a “sage” repairer, with a lyrical texture that doesn’t tip into full opacity. The narrative distance stays controlled, with no head-hopping or intrusive authorial commentary; interior access is smooth. There is some sameness of register across beats, but it feels like a deliberate, meditative tone rather than a loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the hospice setting; phrases like “hymning the mundane” and “pulsing stillness” set a consistent register. POV stays anchored in Elara without head-hopping, though the narration sometimes drifts into a more omniscient, airbrushed tone. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, with Mrs. Bennett’s whispered “Claire” doing understated work. The voice is polished and coherent, if not yet distinctly idiosyncratic or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited is stable, and the register is consistently formal-fantastic, matching the academic/magical subject. The voice has some pleasant phrasings (“like echoes of a forgotten song”) but often defaults to neutral exposition rather than a strongly idiosyncratic Elara-filter. There are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts, but the narrative texture could better reflect her specific mind—how a rune scholar notices, misinterprets, or obsesses. Under pressure, the voice doesn’t modulate rhythmically to heighten intensity, which keeps climactic beats relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches Elara’s sensibility and maintains consistent psychic distance. Diction and rhythm are controlled without slipping into register mismatches, and the brief dialogue from the garden figure sounds appropriately otherworldly yet functional. The narration’s sensory choices and metaphors feel character-coherent rather than generic. There are a few slightly abstract phrasings (“nostalgic innovation”) that read more like authorial coinage than lived perception, but they don’t break the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and consistent, with a soft, lyrical register that matches the contemplative subject matter. Word choice and syntax are competent, and there’s no POV leakage or jarring shifts in tense or distance. That said, the voice leans toward a generalized “fantasy-poetic” idiom without many sharply individual turns of phrase that would make Lira’s perception feel unmistakably her own. The tone remains relatively even, with limited modulation in rhythm or texture as emotional stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical without losing clarity, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Dialogue is concise, plausible, and carries subtext—Kai’s “I wanted to see where you found peace” and Elara’s guarded but open responses feel in character. The narrative rhythm—longer descriptive sentences balanced with shorter, more intimate beats—matches the contemplative tone. There is no head-hopping or distance slippage; interior access is controlled and appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and comfortably inhabits a lyrical, slightly elevated register suitable to the piece’s mythic mood. The diction (“feral nexus,” “swirling hush,” “solemnize”) is coherent, and psychic distance remains stable without head-hopping. That said, the voice feels more like a polished generic literary-fantasy narrator than something distinctly Elara-specific; her perceptual habits and idiom don’t markedly individualize the narration. Under greater pressure, the voice does not modulate much, maintaining the same calm, mystic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and gently lyrical, with a stable, mildly elevated diction that fits the fable-like fantasy tone. POV control is clean; we stay with Elara’s perception throughout without leakage. That said, the narrative idiom often feels generic rather than distinctly hers—few turns of phrase or noticing patterns feel uniquely tied to this particular tinkerer. Rhythm is pleasant but not especially daring under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent diction that suits a meticulous alchemist in a numinous environment. Sentences vary in rhythm and length enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance stays tight on Elara without unmotivated slippage. At times the language risks slight vagueness or repetition of abstract formulations (“moving stillness,” “task at hand”), which blurs the otherwise distinct texture. Overall, though, the perceptual signature—precise, ritualistic, and attentive—is clear and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a soft lyricism that matches the contemplative tone and magical premise. Diction is generally consistent with a reflective artisan in a quasi-mythic space, and free indirect touches blend smoothly with description. The perceptual signature (attention to gears, angles, reflections) gives some distinct flavor. Still, the voice doesn’t push into truly singular territory; rhythms and constructions are competent rather than strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and recognizably filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Phrases like “whalebone reverie” and the careful sensory texture give the narration a distinct flavor, and the dialogue, though stylized, fits the mythic tone. There are no POV slips or stance confusions. At times the voice tilts toward grand abstraction, but it generally maintains control and coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical register that suits Elara’s contemplative state. Diction choices (“crystallized time,” “rust-hued peace,” “hauntingly practical precision”) give the prose a recognizable texture without major register slips. The narrative distance holds steady and appropriate; reflection is clearly bounded within her perception. It’s strong, but the voice leans slightly generic-literary at moments rather than distinctly individual, which keeps it below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a gently lyrical texture that suits the contemplative, speculative tone. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (fractured stillness, hum, fragments) creating cohesion without major opacity. A few phrasings lean toward generic lyricism, but there’s no head-hopping, register whiplash, or clumsy exposition. The voice could be further individualized to Mara’s sensibility, but it’s already strong enough for publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a reflective, mildly lyrical narrative voice well-suited to Eli’s contemplative temperament. Diction and syntax are clean and mostly unobtrusive, and the engineering frame (“systems, networks of cause and effect”) is carried consistently. Still, the voice rarely achieves a distinctly idiosyncratic rhythm or lexicon that could make Eli’s perception uniquely memorable. Occasional abstract generalities flatten what could be sharper, more character-colored noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and suited to a quiet, lyrical fantasy tone, with controlled syntax and a clear perceptual filter through Elara’s sensibilities. Diction like “glacial hush,” “crystal whispering forecourt,” and “excruciatingly gentle precision” contributes to a distinct texture, albeit one that leans ornamental. At times the register veers toward purple, and cadences repeat enough to risk sameness, slightly dulling impact. Nonetheless, POV control is clean, and the voice feels intentional and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close-ish POV is stable and mostly consistent, with a mildly lyrical narrative voice that fits the contemplative tone. Diction is controlled but somewhat generic for this kind of speculative quest story, relying on familiar formulations (“world seemed to hold its breath,” “sense that something was about to change”). There are no head-hops or major distance slips, though occasional omniscient touches blur how much is Elara’s perception versus authorial stance. Overall, the voice is competent and clear but not yet distinctly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person, close-ish narration is stable, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative scene. Diction is controlled and consistent, and the perceptual focus—knots, glass, fog—is distinctly Elara’s. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the voice feels of a piece throughout. The lyricism is pleasant rather than strikingly idiosyncratic, keeping it just below elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the contemplative, lyrical tone. Sentence rhythm and diction feel deliberate without becoming mannered, and the traveler’s observational bias (detail-rich, attentive to texture and light) gives the narration a perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in the woman’s minimalism and the traveler’s restraint. There are a few moments of generalized, essay-like explanation, but they don’t seriously disrupt POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent elevated, slightly lyrical register that suits the fable-like tone. Diction is generally controlled and avoids glaring register slips, and there is no POV confusion or head-hopping. That said, the voice leans somewhat generic fantasy-lyric at times (“ancient secrets,” “essence of life itself”) rather than offering a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature tied to Kael. It’s competent and smooth, but not yet distinctive enough to stand out in a crowded literary field.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctively lyrical, with recurring textures (“black sand,” “obsidian water,” “migration of clouds”) that feel intentional rather than decorative. Diction and rhythm suit a contemplative, accumulative piece, and psychic distance remains steady. A few turns of phrase edge toward purple or generic uplift, but they don’t break the voice or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical yet controlled diction that suits Elara’s reflective, imaginative mind. Phrases like “sidereal patience” and “liquid starlight” feel intentional and pattern-consistent, giving the narrative a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance is well-managed, moving smoothly between description and interior alignment with Elara. The main constraint is that the voice, while polished, rarely surprises at the sentence level in ways that would elevate it into truly distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with a lyrical register that fits the speculative, meditative material. There are no POV slips or cheap elisions; the narrative distance remains consistent. That said, the voice leans on familiar poetic constructions and abstractions, so Elara’s perception feels more archetypal than uniquely hers. Rhythm and diction are competent but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a contemplative artisan in a liminal space. Syntax and diction show some rhythmic variety and a consistent perceptual bias toward texture, weight, and pattern (stone, threads, wings). There are a few phrases that feel abstract or slightly generic (“fiercely meditative presence,” “purpose clearer”) but they don’t break POV plausibility. Stronger idiosyncratic turns of phrase or sharper sensory biases could make the voice more unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and appropriate to Elias’s reflective temperament; phrases like “the sea whispered secrets to the stone” establish a consistent sensibility. Narrative distance and tense remain controlled, with no head-hopping or register shocks. That said, the diction sometimes drifts toward generic high-literary solemnity rather than a sharply particularized perceptual signature. The voice is polished and competent, but not yet unmistakable or unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to the meditative mode, with recurring textures (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) establishing a clear narrative sensibility. Diction is elevated but consistent with the chosen tone, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shifts. The risk is a slight sameness and occasional over-plush phrasing, but control remains solid.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent elevated register that fits the quasi-mythic premise. There are some nice turns of phrase, but the diction and rhythm are fairly conventional and could belong to many fantasy-leaning narrators. Expository lines occasionally tell us what objects “are said” to do or what his work “was,” sapping immediacy. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive or surprising enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with a consistent, slightly elevated lyric voice that suits Clara’s bookish, meticulous nature. Diction choices like “thistled calm” and “ember alcove in mist” create a recognizable perceptual signature without breaking plausibility. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and shifts in intensity (when the radio brightens, when she writes frantically) are reflected in the rhythm of the prose. Occasionally the narration leans into decorative phrasing that feels more authorial than character-rooted, but not to a disruptive degree.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and broadly aligned with Elara’s reflective, art-inflected perspective. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to avoid monotony, with some nicely controlled sentences that braid observation and emotion. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction remains consistent. At times the register leans slightly generic-abstract (“crystallize a fleeting emotion,” “somber and marvelous”) rather than sharply character-particular, which keeps it below top-tier distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close on Kael is stable and consistent, and the narrative diction (slightly elevated, reflective) fits his philosophizing nature. Dialogue is generally clear and functional, with some differentiation between Kael’s more formal tone and Lira’s sharper, mocking directness, though both occasionally sound like vehicles for theme. There are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough in rhythm or idiom to feel memorable at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-controlled, with consistent diction and a calm, almost devotional cadence that suits the subject. Some phrases push toward abstraction or faint awkwardness (“denote the importance of her craft,” “traveled stillness,” “unlearning hatred” used as an environmental property) but do not break clarity or POV. The narrative distance is mostly steady, leaning toward omniscient-lyric but without head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall, the voice is polished and distinctive enough for solid mid–high range, though not yet razor-specific to Elara’s inner texture.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, coherent, and largely invisible in a good way; it doesn’t head-hop or contradict itself. There are some nicely turned phrases, but the diction often defaults to familiar fantasy-lyric registers (“glow of a thousand moons,” “wisdom beyond measure,” “once-in-a-lifetime event”). Elara’s perceptual signature is present but not especially sharp or idiosyncratic, reading more like a neutral narrator than a chef with a unique cognitive sense. Rhythm and tense are controlled, with no technical stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person-limited POV is stable and coherent, with a consistent register that fits quiet speculative fiction. The narrative voice has some texture (“nectar dusk sky,” “silent sentinel”) without slipping into total purple prose. At times it leans generic and explanatory, especially around the orb’s function and the drones’ sacrifice, which undercuts distinctiveness. There is no dialogue to test, so the voice rides entirely on exposition and description, limiting dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and gently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature focused on small shifts and overlooked objects. Phrases like “creeping normality noticer” and “shard of hush” give the voice texture and identity. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; distance remains steady and appropriate. Occasionally the diction drifts toward abstract or slightly precious (“hushed blaze”), but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice centered on Liora is stable, clear, and lyrically inclined without becoming opaque. Phrases like “its telepathic senses threading through the diver’s mind” show a distinct texture, and the shift into Elara’s spoken line is natural. The narrative distance stays consistent and omniscient intrusions are minimal. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally striking, though not yet singularly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, mildly elevated lyricism that fits Elara’s mathematical/philosophical mind and the surreal setting. Diction choices like “ruptured the boundaries of logic” and “boundless confinement” feel coherent with her worldview rather than imposed from outside. There is good modulation—sentence rhythm slows for reflection and tightens around the die’s fall—without slips into expository explanation beyond the chosen reflective mode. It’s distinctive and steady, though not yet so singular or rhythmically daring as to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without becoming opaque, and well-matched to an introspective, artist protagonist. Diction choices like “deep, saffron quiet” and “pigment a deep indigo that shimmered like the night sky” feel intentional and character-inflected rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what images already convey. The voice is distinct and controlled enough to be immediately recognizable across pages.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a gently lyrical texture that suits a historically minded guide in a fantastical city. Diction is consistent, and focalization stays cleanly with Elara without head-hopping or stance confusion. While the voice is competent and occasionally striking, it is not yet idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext, which narrows the range on display.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly gothic diction that suits the setting and premise. Phrasing like “latent radiance,” “neatly inventive mind,” and “bleak exhilaration” contributes to a recognizable texture without slipping registers. POV boundaries are respected, and narrative distance is well controlled, sliding closer at the climax. Some formulations lean on familiar constructions, so the voice stops short of feeling truly singular or idiosyncratic at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and legible, with a mildly gothic, elevated diction that suits the funhouse and advisor while remaining coherent for Clara. The advisor’s lines carry a distinct cadence and register from the narration, and dialogue generally advances premise and stakes rather than padding. However, the narrative voice lacks a strongly individualized perceptual signature for Clara herself; the language often feels more like an impersonal gothic narrator than a consciousness under acute pressure. There are no significant POV slips or mechanical dialogue issues.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and lyrically inclined, matching the fable-like, contemplative mode. Leeward’s perceptual lens—attuned to patterns, sound, and the sea—is distinct enough to feel like a particular consciousness. Some phrasing slips into familiar, generic constructions (“a testament to nature’s resilience,” “hummed with a life of its own”), slightly diluting distinctiveness. Overall, control is good and consistent, but not yet singular or surprising enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited POV is stable, and the diction—“sunwashed dread,” “language of patterns,” “silent watchers”—establishes a consistent, slightly lyrical voice that suits the quasi-mythic setting. Narrative distance is handled well, sliding between close interiority and broader description without confusion or head-hopping. The telepathic voice is integrated smoothly and clearly distinguished from the main narration. A bit more idiosyncrasy specific to Elara (rather than to the world) would push the voice from strong to truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and appropriate to a disciplined historian, with a steady, reflective tone. Diction is slightly elevated but generally plausible for this focalizer and stays stable throughout. There’s little modulation of distance under peak beats, so the voice remains calm even where sharper intensity might deepen impact. Overall, it’s competent and coherent but not especially distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and well controlled, with a lyrical tilt that suits the contemplative mood. Phrasing like “hushed blaze of anticipation” and “interlaced absence” creates a distinct texture, even if it occasionally feels more authorial than character-specific. POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the narrative stance modulates gently with his discoveries. While not strikingly idiosyncratic, the voice is polished and coherent enough for serious venues.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a controlled, mildly lyrical register that suits the contemplative exploration. Diction is consistent and there is no POV slippage; reflection stays anchored in Elara’s perceptions. The narrative texture is pleasant but not particularly idiosyncratic, relying on a few repeated coinages (“reclaimed stillness,” “tranquilly perceptive”). Under pressure, the voice doesn’t significantly modulate or fracture in a way that would deepen character or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and sensibly limited to Kael’s perceptions, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the fantastical setting. There is a discernible perceptual signature in how he notices craft, light, and texture. Dialogue is functional and clear, though Lira’s lines sometimes sound more like authorial commentary than fully embodied speech. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent, if not uniquely idiosyncratic at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a consistent elevated yet legible register that suits the speculative-literary mode. Phrases like “intangibly tangible energy” and “repository of potential” show a taste for abstraction but don’t break the POV plausibility given Zara’s physics background. The perceptual signature is competent, though not deeply idiosyncratic; the narration sometimes sounds more like an essay on meaning than Zara’s pressured cognition. Still, distance control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or tense confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and technically clean, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. The narrative voice is competent but fairly generic, relying on familiar phrases and neutral diction rather than a strong, idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Repetitions like “perpetually surprised expression” and a tendency to explain (“His mission was clear:”) flatten the texture. Rhythm and syntax are serviceable but not doing notable expressive work under moments of supposed intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and lyrically shaded in a way that fits a brooding, educated forger of histories. Diction and imagery (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”) give the prose a recognizable texture without lapsing into overt abstraction. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and interior access is clean. Occasionally the register flirts with purple, but it remains controlled and character-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with an elevated but controlled lyricism that suits the solemn, high-stakes negotiation. Elara’s interior lens shapes the narration, and the diction stays plausibly within a high-fantasy literary register. Dialogue is polished and a bit too aphoristic for real speech, but it does carry subtext and move the scene rather than merely recapping theme. There is no head-hopping or distance confusion, and psychic distance is well managed.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with someone who thinks in navigational metaphors. Rhythm and diction are controlled; sentences vary enough to avoid monotony, and the reflective tone matches the quiet, internal stakes. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience, and the narrative distance stays consistent. Some phrasing leans toward generic introspective language, but the overall perceptual signature—tools, horizons, poles—is recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a lyrical but readable texture that suits the contemplative mode. Diction is mostly consistent with Elias’s perspective, though occasional phrases (“world that felt increasingly hollow,” “collector of secrets”) flirt with generic literary register. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how he notices light, reflection, and pattern. Under pressure the voice maintains coherence without slipping into expository over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical-fantasy register that suits the material. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the brief dialogue is clean and functional without breaking tone or POV. That said, the narrative voice feels somewhat generic for the genre, lacking strong idiosyncratic tics or a distinctive perceptual bias that would mark it as singular. It’s polished and coherent but not yet memorable at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinctly colored by Elara’s sensibility as a cartomancer attuned to symbols and time. Syntax and rhythm are varied and apt for the contemplative, slightly enchanted mood. Lexicon choices like “choking beauty,” “cloudbound realm,” and “onyx ink” feel intentional and of a piece, without jarring register shifts. There is little dialogue, but the interior and narrative stances are tightly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, controlled, and tonally appropriate—measured, reflective, and gently lyrical without major register slips. Diction like “gravitationally lighter,” “essence of compassion,” and “harmonic resonance” creates a consistent, slightly elevated SF-mystical flavor. What’s missing is a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature for Elara; her thoughts and phrasing could belong to many earnest SF protagonists. Overall, the POV control is sound but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary placement.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent contemplative register that fits the material. Elara’s perceptual bias—toward celestial patterns, symbolic meaning in coincidence, and texture of change—is evident, though sometimes phrased in generalized terms that could belong to many narrators. There’s no POV leakage or awkward shifts in stance. A touch more idiosyncratic diction or rhythm at peak moments would help distinguish this voice at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited POV on Elara is stable, and the narrative diction—slightly elevated, quietly dramatic—fits the fantastical setting. Her perceptual signature (attentive to mechanisms, codes, and security details) is consistent, if not especially idiosyncratic. Dialogue is clear and functional, though often direct and thematically on-the-nose rather than layered with subtext. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent but not yet striking or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-matched to a mythic, ritual-focused tale, with a coherent blend of exterior action and interior perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled; phrases like “borrowed dawn” and “tapestry woven by time itself” feel of a piece with the world rather than arbitrary ornament. POV distance is consistent—close enough to feel Kael’s fixation, far enough to sustain a lyrical register—with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the narration drifts toward generic mystical register, but not enough to break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and largely convincing as Elara’s interior register. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to maintain flow, with storm and timing motifs creating a recognizable tonal pattern. There’s some mild repetition of constructions and high-register diction that edges toward “literary default,” but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity. The voice handles introspection and image-making with confidence and without noticeable head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is steady, mildly elevated third-person with a clear aesthetic and no POV slippage; diction and rhythm are controlled. Dialogue reads stylized but coherent, suitable to “dueling philosophers,” and it does advance the conflict. Elias and Mara’s lines carry distinct stances, though their idioms are not sharply differentiated. The piece occasionally edges toward essayistic exposition, but the overall stance remains narratively anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, Elias-focused POV is stable, with a consistent lyric register that suits a poet protagonist and maintains mood. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some strong phrases (“map of scars,” “luminous fracture”) and clean, functional dialogue that fits both characters. At times the narration drifts toward generalized lyricism that feels slightly authorial rather than distinctly Elias’s perception, softening the perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays moderate and clear, but there’s room for sharper, more character-specific texture under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a gently lyrical diction that fits Elara’s sensibility and the fantastical setting. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and focalization stays cleanly bound to her perceptions and knowledge. The voice is competent and occasionally graceful, though not yet so distinctive or rhythmically daring that it feels singular.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lucid, and mildly lyrical, with consistent distance around Elara. Diction is generally appropriate to the mythic-fable mode, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrases (“empirically whimsical,” “luminous doubt”) gesture toward a distinctive texture but are not fully integrated into a unique perceptual signature. The voice is competent and pleasant rather than truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, measured, and harmonizes with Elias’s slow, deliberate nature; diction and rhythm feel cohesive. Lyrical touches like “tides of remembrance” and “cerulean glow” create a distinct tonal signature without obscuring clarity. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the distance remains controlled. A few phrases flirt with generic lyricism, but overall the voice would not be out of place in a strong literary magazine.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is melodramatic and heavily filtered ("she felt," "she saw," "she knew"), creating unnecessary distance. The narrative relies on "emotional tell" phrases ("quaking reverie," "inexplicable pull") instead of embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and melodramatic, relying on high-flown phrases ("staggering grace," "whispered in the wind") that distance the reader from the immediate grit of the scene. The tone feels performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the surreal content. However, it leans heavily into poetic abstraction ("symphony of the unseen," "ethereal light") that sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.1)
    Voice is distant and heavily filtered ("She felt as though"), keeping the reader at arm's length. The dialogue acts as stagey soliloquy ("First, the crucible must be heated") rather than natural speech or thought.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and overly earnest, frequently resorting to abstract emotional summaries ("trembling certainty," "timeless embrace"). There is little distinction between the narrator's interpretation and the character's immediate experience; the POV feels distant despite the attempt at intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on distancing filters ("seemed to," "as if") that dilute immediacy. The tone leans into purple prose ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") that feels constructed around prompt phrases rather than organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, relying on "filter" phrases ("Unit-7 felt," "Unit-7 saw") that distance the reader. The interiority drifts into generic spiritual abstractions rather than establishing a distinct, grounded robotic perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is overly adjective-heavy and distances the reader from the POV. Dialogue is stiff and unnatural, serving as a vehicle for thematic statements rather than character interaction. The prose frequently tells the reader what the gestures mean ("filled with intent") rather than trusting the action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like register that filters out immediacy ("time seemed to," "as if it carried"). The narrative distance prevents deep interior access, resulting in a "telling" of emotions rather than embodied experience. The insertion of prompt phrases breaks the voice's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.1)
    The POV is functional but suffers from heavy "telling" of internal states (e.g., "mind racing," "heart pounded"). The narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard thriller cadences and inserted prompt phrases that disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the character's internal state ("inexplicable pull," "profound sense of peace") instead of inhabiting her perspective. This creates a distance that prevents emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a "poetic" register that occasionally distances the reader ("liminality," "auroral sorrow"). The dialogue feels artificial—scripted aphorisms rather than natural speech. The POV remains stable with Elara, but the interiority is often summarizing rather than experiencing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice leans heavily on clichés ("air hung heavy," "silent witness," "frozen in time") that distance the reader. Filter verbs ("she couldn't shake the feeling," "she realized") dilute immediacy. The tone feels manufactured rather than emerging from the character's distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice creates distance through the overuse of filter verbs ("Lira noticed," "she felt," "she knew") and explanatory interiority. The prose tells the reader what Lira is experiencing—often using elevated, archaic diction—rather than embodying those sensations in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and sentimental ("symphony only she could hear"), distancing the reader from the immediate action. Dialogue is stilted and unnatural, serving primarily as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distancing and over-explanatory ("as befitted her nature"), frequently summarizing significance instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning through the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice is distant and summary-heavy, relying on "it was as if" constructions to filter experience. The omniscient perspective feels detached, preventing any immersion in the character's immediate reality. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the narration reads like a plot outline.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying on elevated, mythic diction ("essence," "void") that creates a barrier to engagement. The omniscient perspective summarizes the character's experience rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overwritten, purple quality that creates distance. The lofty tone ("symphony of the chronologically homesick") feels performative. High psychic distance prevents intimacy, leaving the reader observing the writer's emotions rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice suffers from excessive filtering ("She knew," "She felt," "She saw"), which creates an unnecessary distance between the reader and the experience. The tone leans into melodrama with elevated abstractions ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") that clutter the prose. There is little distinction in the voice; it reads as a generic third-person account rather than a character-specific perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and abstract poeticism ("symphony of existence," "whisper of possibility"). The tone feels imposed by the author rather than arising from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.5)

    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, summarizing the character's psychology instead of dramatizing it through distinct perception. The promise of a "circuitously sincere" voice is not kept; the prose is standard, direct omniscient-adjacent that tells the reader exactly what to think. Psychic distance is poorly controlled, jumping from observation to deep abstraction without earning the leap.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.5)

    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a high-fantasy register, though it occasionally dips into bureaucratic diction ("certify it as essential") that clashes with the ethereal tone. The focus remains tight on Elara, but the interiority is often expository.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.0)

    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, utilizing a fable-like tone that prioritizes summary over immediate scene. The perspective filters the world through abstract nouns rather than distinct sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, maintaining a high psychic distance that summarizes emotion rather than dramatizing it. The tone often drifts into melodramatic clichés ("eyes red from crying," "heart full").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.3)
    The POV is consistent but distant, often slipping into explanatory summary ("Elara knew that rushing would lead to mistakes") rather than immediate, sensory experience. The voice leans on standard fantasy registers without establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into high-fantasy clichés ("shimmered like spun silver") and expository dialogue that functions as information delivery rather than interaction. The narrative distance remains observational, summarizing the character's internal state instead of immersing the reader in it.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt") and explanatory interiority. The narrative distance is too close to a fable-like summary, preventing the reader from experiencing the moment through immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is stable, but the voice suffers from artificiality, particularly in dialogue. Lines like "I wanted to see where you found peace" read as written thematic signposts rather than natural human speech. The narrative voice is consistent but leans on "poetic" clichés that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is competent but overly expository, often summarizing emotional states rather than evoking them. Register slips like "ephemeral cameo appearance" clash with the attempted lyrical tone, creating an artificial feel. Psychic distance is too remote to create immersion in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a generic "storybook" tone with frequent filtering ("She knew," "She felt"). Emotional beats are told rather than shown, and the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature that distinguishes Elara’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative distance slips into "Helpful Narrator" mode, explaining the significance of actions ("testament to," "demonstration of") rather than trusting the dramatization; the voice relies on abstract poeticisms ("essence of constellations") rather than specific, grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice adopts a distant, fable-like tone that relies on telling the reader the emotional import of objects ("intricate gears," "symphony") rather than evoking it. The reliance on stock phrasing and breathless wonder flattens the distinctiveness of the character's perception. The prose maintains a consistent register but lacks a unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, often prioritizing poetic sound over clarity. The integration of required phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped" disrupts the rhythm, feeling inserted rather than organic to the narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, mediating the character's experience through summaries rather than immediate perception. The narration dictates the emotional temperature ("rust-hued peace") rather than evoking it through distinct voice or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing Mara's methods and motivations ("Her method was always the same," "Mara’s motivation was clear") instead of showing them in action. The tone leans into melodrama ("fractured stillness," "desperate plea") without earning the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic ("relic of a bygone era," "stoic wonder"). It frequently tells the reader what to feel through diagnostic labels instead of evoking emotion through distance control or specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into a sentimental, "fairytale" register that softens the edges of the conflict ("kissed their surfaces," "forgotten melody"). While the POV is stable, the filter of nostalgia distances the reader from the immediacy of the character's frustration.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic, relying on "purple" phrasing ("whisper secrets of time long past") that creates distance. The tone is self-important, telling the reader what to feel ("Elara’s motivation was clear") instead of allowing the scene to evoke those emotions naturally. While the prose is grammatically functional, the lack of distinct perceptual texture makes the voice feel generic.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly respectful and distant, lacking a distinct perceptual signature (Perceptual Signature flaw). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("She believed," "She felt," "She knew") which creates distance. The tone feels like a generic fable rather than a grounded narrative with a specific POV.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and polished but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly explaining the emotional significance of actions ("intimate," "sacred space") instead of letting them stand alone. The tone is overly reverent, which creates a distance that prevents visceral engagement with the characters' pain.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant and slightly melodramatic ("time seemed to have forgotten its purpose"). The high psychic distance prevents immersion in Kael's immediate sensory experience, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, summarizing the protagonist's emotional shifts instead of showing them. The tone leans into "writerly" affectation with heavy similes rather than a distinct character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a generic "storybook" tone that creates excessive psychic distance. The narration relies on flowery abstraction ("sidereal patience," "liquid starlight") rather than grounded observation. While mechanically competent, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, drifting into omniscient moralizing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is overwrought and passive, relying heavily on filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized," "She believed") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is consistently "purple" without variation in rhythm or texture to match the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.5)
    The POV is consistent but filtered through distancing verbs ("she noticed," "she felt," "she knew"). The voice adopts a generic "literary" register that prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over distinct character perception, leading to a flat emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly distant, using an elevated, fable-like register that prevents intimacy with the focalizer. The narration habitually diagnoses emotions ("felt a profound sense of peace") instead of embodying them in reaction and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "thesaurus-itis," prioritizing elevated vocabulary ("relics," "sanctuary," "sentinel") that creates distance rather than intimacy. The tone feels performative, telling the reader the moment is profound rather than showing it through the character's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies on high-fantasy register clichés ("promise of something yet unwritten," "cascade of possibility"). The tone is earnest but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, and the handling of the character's name undermines textual authority.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is consistent but filtered through distancing verbs ("Clara noticed," "she felt," "she knew") that reduce immediacy. The narrative voice tends toward purple abstraction ("thistled calm," "cloak herself in mystery") rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and explanatory, often summarizing emotional states ("somber and marvelous") instead of evoking them. The perspective feels distant and "writerly," filtering the experience through abstract conclusions rather than immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory and intrusive, frequently categorizing the characters' psychologies instead of letting them breathe. Dialogue is stiff and functions primarily as a vehicle for thematic exposition ("Your narrative... is what’s destroying us") rather than natural interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly earnest and melodramatic, frequently relying on abstract concepts ("hollow silence," "living cathedral") instead of grounded observation. The integration of prompt phrases like "traveled stillness" disrupts the register, creating awkward syntactic moments. The POV distance is inconsistent, drifting from internal thoughts to broad omniscient summary without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly explaining Elara's feelings ("Elara felt it too") instead of showing them. The tone leans into melodrama ("scars on an old warrior," "glow of a thousand moons").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, summarizing emotional states ("Elara’s heart raced") instead of evoking them through perception. The psychic distance remains static, preventing the reader from inhabiting the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative distance is kept wide by a high density of filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "realized"), preventing immediate immersion. The voice drifts into abstract summary to explain the character's depth instead of demonstrating it through perception or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizes key emotional beats instead of inhabiting them. Overuse of filter verbs ("Liora sensed," "believed") creates a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly interpreting the scene and explaining the protagonist's psyche instead of trusting the dramatization. The distance is too remote to feel the protagonist's struggle, relying on summary over scene. The tone is consistently elevated but lacks a distinct, character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("iridescent sheen," "deep indigo that shimmered") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The POV remains stable, but the narration often explains Elara's feelings rather than trusting the reader to infer them from her perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, frequently summarizing emotions ("rosewater dread," "anticipation") instead of rendering them through specific perception or action. The tone is consistent but generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish Elara’s worldview from a standard narrator. There is a reliance on telling over showing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans on melodramatic phrasing ("piercing... like a broken tooth") that distances the reader. The tone holds, but the emotional resonance is dampened by the lack of interior vulnerability or distinct perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice relies on telling emotional states ("repulsive allure," "voice trembling") and cliché descriptors ("skeletal reminder") rather than evoking distinct perception. Dialogue is stilted and expository, functioning primarily to explain the plot mechanics rather than reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is too great, filtering experience through summary realizations ("realized what was happening," "began to understand") rather than immediate sensation. The voice leans on elevated, fable-like abstractions that distance the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but generic, lacking a unique perceptual signature or rhythmic variety to distinguish it from standard genre prose. The shift from "dread" to "hope" at the end feels unearned by the scene's events, dictated by plot requirements rather than character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the significance of every object and thought rather than trusting the dramatization. The psychic distance is too great, keeping the reader observing the character's conclusions rather than experiencing her process.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a melodramatic, elevated register that distances the reader ("hushed blaze of connection," "uncommon urgency"). Narrative filter verbs ("he realized," "he felt") frequently displace immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but visibly constrained by the need to insert specific prompt phrases, resulting in awkward constructions ("mind was tranquilly perceptive"). The tone is explanatory, often telling the reader what to think about Elara's motivation rather than showing it in operation. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the character's thoughts and motivations ("she understood," "she realized"). This creates a distance that prevents immersion and reduces the emotional impact of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies on stock adventure phrasing ("strange resonance," "ancient age"). The repeated character tag "perpetually surprised" feels mechanically inserted and creates a dissonant image for a "sharp-eyed" competent pilot.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on "purple" descriptors ("cobalt," "fractured," "relentless"). The tone is melodramatic, creating a distance that prevents genuine emotional engagement with the character's plight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice affects a high-literary tone that results in stilted, unnatural dialogue incompatible with the grit of a storm-swept negotiation. The characters speak in polished thematic statements rather than goal-driven interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama and clichés ("flickering like a candle in the wind," "dawn that promised possibility"). Interiority is filtered through high-level abstraction, distancing the reader from the character's immediate sensory experience. The psychic distance is static, offering a "helpful narrator" who explains emotions instead of showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on melodrama and adjective-heavy description ("jagged edges," "hollow"). It often tells the reader what to feel ("hypnotic," "strange pull") rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.4)
    Voice is consistent but generic, leaning heavily on high-fantasy register. Dialogue is stilted ("You have done well, beast whisperer") and functions primarily as exposition to explain the plot and theme to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, stepping in to interpret actions for the reader ("It was a small act, but symbolic"). This over-explanation distances the reader and flattens the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and reverent, filtering the experience through abstract emotional summaries rather than immediate sensory details. This creates a barrier to empathy and lowers the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized in a melodramatic register that creates distance rather than intimacy. The reliance on purple prose ("whisper of life," "sinking into the cool grains") creates a filter that obscures the character's immediate experience. The tone feels forcedly "epic" rather than grounded in the character's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice is generic and functional, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative frequently summarizes emotional states ("Intrigue had always been Elara’s forte") instead of filtering them through the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized and stiff, creating distance rather than intimacy. Dialogue often reads like a philosophical tract ("You mistake the void for the vessel") rather than natural speech between opponents under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is overly sentimental and reliant on purple prose ("echoing like a forgotten hymn"), with a static narrative distance. POV filtering ("Elias felt," "noticed") distances the reader, and the characters' voices converge into the same thematic register.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but generic, employing standard fantasy registers without a unique perceptual signature. The tone is functional but lacks distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental ("soothed his weary soul"), filtering the experience through interpretive labels rather than concrete sensory immediacy. The tone remains static, lacking the modulation or distinct texture expected of high-literary prose.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s scientific perceptual filter—shimmer, frame, soil chemistry. Syntax is calm, slightly formal, miriting her deliberate temperament; no register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Prose is texture-driven rather than plot-driven, a valid choice under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent glass-artist perceptual signature: noticing refracted light, reading texture, valuing translucence. Diction (“luminous,” “kiln,” “frost-patterns”) precise to vocation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure: short verbless fragments (“Here, she found the final piece…”) mimic breathless find. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, clipped for discovery beats. Dialogue absent by design; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is musicianly—vibration felt in bone, colors as chords. Syntax grows leaner under pressure (“She struck. Colors answered.”) showing rhythmic control. No dialogue contamination; silent signing is described, not quoted, preserving lyric distance. Fork-as-mouthpiece moment is idiosyncratic and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent Gothic-lyric: “weight of years spent burying the unburyable,” “chased stillness.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses in fragment search, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so no register clash; diction stays within undertaker’s mournful lexicon. One filter-verb cluster (“felt a strange connection”) slips into summary; otherwise perceptual signature is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-limited stays close to Mara; no head-hopping. Syntax is clean, diction elevated but consistent: “terra-cotta arbor,” “amplified quiet.” Distinct perceptual signature is moderate; wind and moonlight recur but do not color every observation. Dialogue is sparse and functional; widow’s lines carry no subtext. Rhythm is steady, with minor template cadence in “she spoke of…she said…she lifted.”

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices lens flare, scent shift, iron temperature. Syntax lengthens and softens with breath, mirroring twilight diffusion. No head-hop; unreliability never claimed. Diction—“camera obscura artist,” “Kwan Yin’s tear”—is specific yet within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates: short sentences under sparks, longer cadence during memory flood. Distinctive texture without mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the liberator; perceptual signature is tactical—every noticed detail is a potential lever. Syntax tightens under pressure: “They grabbed as many jars as they could carry, their chains now a hindrance they could no longer afford.” No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within a scavenger’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates in the ladder climb without drumbeat monotony. Voice coherence survives the entire escape sprint.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s synesthetic filter; distance stable. Perceptual signature—“hum of colors”—threads every observation, preventing generic lyricism. Compression taught early (“cells divided at an unnatural pace”) is legible at closure when time’s bending justifies memory-imprint science. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk waived; syntax mirrors her sensorial hyper-alertness without drum-beat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct lyric texture: “golden-hour portrait thief,” “luminous disbelief”—diction stays within poetic-noir register. Rhythm modulates: long clause for stealth, staccato for chime shock. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct: “fingers brushed,” “eyes narrowed.” Elara’s voice converges slightly at closure but internal differentiation holds through shared yearning rather than voice collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice is stable, perceptual signature filtered through glassblower attention: heat, viscosity, fracture-risk. Syntax modulates from languid opening clauses to short imperative self-commands (“And neither will the heart”) that mimic breath control at the pipe. No dialogue, so indirection tests are N/A. One template cadence run—“she...she...she...”—in the final third slightly dulls rhythm, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close sustains consistent psychic distance; perception skews toward tactile paranoia—cool shell, groaning beams. Syntax tightens under stress: clipped clauses mirror racing thoughts. No head-hop; shell-whisper stays external/ambiguous, preserving POV modesty. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” level diction in “trembling certainty” refrain—is justified as incantatory interior mantra.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to oracle perception; diction is consistent, slightly elevated but plausible for a mystic. Rhythm modulates with sentence length, mirroring the hush without drum-beat monotony. Perceptual signature is present—oracle notices silence, flaking gold, star extinction—though not razor-distinct. No dialogue, so no voice collision; the narrative voice achieves a poised, incantatory texture that supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Unit-7’s sensorium: “its sensors detecting,” “its gaze falling.” Perceptual signature is crisp, metallic, slightly distant. Syntax remains level, mirroring machine composure; no rhythmic surge under climax. No dialogue to test voice divergence. Filter verbs (“it seemed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Elara’s registrar attention to logging and refracted light. Syntax is steady, lightly lyric, matching hush tone; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but natural (“It’s beautiful”) with subtext carried in pause and smile. No register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric, close third aligns with patient vine-dresser perception: synesthetic glow, seasonal patience, tactile precision. Rhythm slows to ritual cadence; compressed diction under pressure (“he polished, placed, breathed”) mirrors method. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Diction stays rooted in horticultural lexicon; elevated metaphors (“fragment of the garden’s soul”) are brief and patterned early. Perceptual signature holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person close maintains clean psychic distance; perceptual signature is mechanic-technical (“magnetic nexus, pulsed mechanically warm”) without drifting into academic overload. Rhythm accelerates under stress via shorter beat clusters; no filter-verb stacks. Voice coherence intact; no dialogue to judge. Minor over-reliance on compound adjectives (“mechanically warm glow,” “icy warmth”) but pattern consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited hovers close to Clara’s musician ear: she hears “unstruck chords,” sees “waterlogged floor,” thinks in metronomic repetitions—“in between spaces” echoed thrice with shifting stress, teaching the pattern. No head-hopping; ghost remains opaque, described only through Clara’s sensory filter. Syntax breathes with the scene—long lyrical sentences for drift, then clipped fragments when the figure appears. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she noticed”) are minimal and voice-motivated. The 8.1 reflects a distinct perceptual signature that modulates under pressure yet never loses clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature strong—she notices ozone, petal gradients, station creaks in character-specific hierarchy. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during reflection, clipped fragments under visual blur. No head-hop; free indirect clean. Diction within lexicon; “auroral sorrow” is lone poetic reach but justified by fever-vision context. Voice distinct, stable, and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is generic thriller cadence rather than idiosyncratic interior voice. No dialogue to test naturalism. Syntax stays serviceable but templated (“air hung heavy,” “shadows twisted into shapes”). No purposeful elision or rhythmic pattern taught; voice neither obscures nor elevates clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited voice is stable, rhythmic, and sensorily skewed to Lira’s cataloguing mind: “vine tendrils embracing tomes” reads as her professional metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax breathes with pressure—long clauses in library hush, fragment-like bursts during catacomb crawl. No dialogue, so voice carries full texture; diction stays within a keeper’s plausible lexicon. Final image’s spare cadence “she had become the silence” earns Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person omniscient maintains stable distance, but narration slips into aspirational uplift (“bridge the ordinary with the extraordinary”) that over-articulates stakes. Perceptual signature is soft—Elara’s musician ear rarely shapes syntax or metaphor. Otherwise prose is clean, with rhythmic variance in eclipse cadence. Dialogue is minimal and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric floats close to Elara’s sensorium—“her fingers traced,” “her mind probing”—with consistent diction. Syntax is elevated but stays within a historian’s lexicon; no sudden thesaurus drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for archival calm, shorter fragments at ritual peak. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is avoided; perceptual signature is stable if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent hush-and-glow register; syntax is controlled, rhythm modulates with breath. Perceptual signature limited to “cryptic” diction but avoids filter clutter. Voice is the strongest layer yet remains ornamental—never complicates or charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric maintains a consistent ecclesiastical cadence; diction stays within the priest’s cosmological lexicon. Compression (“decorates with silence”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice maintains a hushed, incantatory register consistent with the “upturned hush” tone; diction stays within the lyric-essay idiom the piece teaches.

No dialogue, so no convergence risk; compression and elision are patterned and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature favors luminous visual metaphors consistent with light-based world. Rhythm modulates with long sentence swell versus clipped final line, supporting breath of realization. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction stays within plausible lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing—“periodically eternal nature”—slips toward editorial voice, minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Elara’s sensorium—she “felt the vibrations through her feet.” Diction is rhythmic, drum-like: “surface smooth yet silent,” “audibly muted tones.” No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“filament of hush”) are sparse and pattern-taught early. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: final drum-tap is one stark sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Perceptual signature is sharp—Elias notices “damp earth” and “erratic behavior” in storm data, diction precise yet unfussy. Compression is taught early (“ gathered his tools and a satchel, careful not to disturb…”) and maintained; no scaffold loops. Free indirect style stays clean: “his credibly curious nature sparking a flicker of intrigue” borders on label but is saved by immediate sensory follow-through. Rhythm accelerates inside the compound without syntactic monotony; final line slows to cadence of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric remains close to Elias’s sensory filter; diction stays consistent, slightly archaic (“aromatically cautious”) without register drift. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative voice: syntax lengthens during memory shards, shortens at uncorking, mirroring inhalation rhythm. Perceptual signature—scent as portal—is sustained; no head-hopping. One minor cadence hiccup: “crystal shadows of his shop seemed to soften” repeats the prompt phrase almost verbatim, drawing attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature: synesthetic rope-twist = time-twist, terra-cotta dust = stanzas. Rhythm compresses under mirror touch—“for a moment, he saw...”—then lengthens into quiet exit, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, hence no register clash; narration diction stays within wanderer-poet lexicon. Free indirect “texture of time” repeats as obsession motif, consistent and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric sustains a controlled, rhythmic cadence; selective metaphors (“wooden bones groaning”) stay inside Elara’s acoustic perceptual frame, achieving perceptual signature without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled compression taught early (“light filtered…like molten gold”) and sustained. Perceptual signature—static prickle, scent of damp earth—stays character-bound. No head-hopping; distance stable. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is brief and context-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Elara with consistent psychic distance. Prose is clean, rhythmically neutral, lacking a distinctive perceptual signature. No dialogue on page; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Voice neither obscures nor elevates the material.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-liminal voice stays steady, with pleasing cavern-specific diction (“stalactite drip,” “pale fissure”). Syntax is clean, rhythms varied, no head-hopping. However, interiority lapses into explanatory abstract nouns—“possibilities,” “understanding,” “promise”—flattening perceptual signature. Dialogue absent; prose never risks cadenced compression under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays strictly in Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax grows shorter under rain-pressure, mirroring breath. “Circuitously sincere” voice shows in spiraling hypotactic thoughts that tighten to fragments as she acts. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on internal diction—succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited voice maintains painterly perceptual signature: rain trails as composition, horizon shimmer as palette. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within Elara’s intellectual reach; no register drift. Single POV; no head-hopping. Distinctive without mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensory dissolve; diction stays within her perceptual lexicon (“overlapping shadows,” “shimmered with crystalline structures”). Rhythm accelerates into fragmentation as she disperses into cave, then regains full syntax on return—effective modulation. No dialogue, so no voice-distinction test. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she understood”) cluster in the merge beat but are motivated by disembodiment; not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual filter—salt-stung details, map-symbol recognition. Syntax grows clipped under discovery pressure, then widens during the resonant note.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—garden dirt, star charts, tile warmth—without POV leakage. Syntax is calm, slightly lyrical, matching her measured skepticism; no dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person voice maintains a distant, ageless cadence that suits an immortal observer: long vowel clusters, measured syntax, occasional archaic diction (“escondite,” “eons”).

No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Close third clings to Clara’s perceptual signature—formaldehyde smell, wax gleam, ink ripple felt in mind.

No head-hop; distance stays tight. Filter verbs minimal, diction within a bright child’s range. Voice modulates under stress—good control.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction tilts slightly archaic (“gilded-leaf stationer,” “incandescent restraint”) yet stays internally consistent, giving the prose a lapidary texture that matches the miniature-forest aesthetic. No dialogue means voice is judged on narrative texture alone, which remains controlled and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyric-accumulative voice remains stable, with salt-stained diction and rhythmic sentence variety. Perceptual signature—pattern-seeing, echo-hearing—filters every description. No dialogue to test, but narrative idiom stays consistent. Filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy (“they realized then”) yet pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s sensorium; no POV leakage. Syntax is tactile—fingers “trace contours,” air “hangs heavy”—mirroring her haptic world. No dialogue means voice must carry idiom alone, and it does: “magnetic calm” is not a cliché in this lexicon. Refracted light as narrative lens is taught early and paid off in the final beat, legitimizing the lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person voice maintains lyrical, map-minded diction—“veins of a map,” “silent herald”—without drifting into purple. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop or register breach. Dialogue is absent, so vocal distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which stays controlled and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, mesmeric cadence that matches the ritual pacing; syntax leans on anaphora (“Each step…each echo…”) which risks template cadence but stays purposive. No dialogue means no voice contamination, and perceptual signature remains consistent—Elias notices sound, texture, silence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, with patterned, elevated diction (“lonesome splendor,” “ethereal glow”) that suits temple awe. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under pressure, longer lyrical sweeps during visions. No dialogue to test naturalism.

Rhythm mirrors dawn swell without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“galaxy-chart embroiderer,” “adjacent possibilities,” “echoed silence”—creates distinct speculative register without purple drift. Syntax mirrors textile rhythm: layered clauses mimic stitch-by-stitch attention. Flame’s pulsing and thread-shine carry subtext in place of dialogue. Minor slip: “synchronize” used as verb three times in four sentences mid-scene, creating template cadence; does not obscure clarity but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person omniscient stays close to Elara and never drifts into another consciousness. Syntax is lyric, with purposeful repetition of “unsent,” “unspoken,” “singing” to teach an incantatory pattern that pays off in the final single note. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (“cryptic medium,” “gargoyle’s rainspout”) and does not inflate into pseudo-poetic excess. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice-contamination issues. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptions are embodied (“skin prickled,” “shard trembled”) maintaining immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)

Voice remains singular, not committee.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Narrative voice is consistent, third-person limited to Elias with perceptual tics of stealth (listening for drone of wings, noting scripts). Syntax is fluid, rhythms varied; no filter-verb overload. Dialogue is minimal but quip feels scripted (“not as stealthy as you think / neither are your traps”), lacking idiolectal difference between rogue scholar and scientist. Overall texture competent yet generic—no signature diction or syntactic fingerprint that would mark Elias’s linguist mind.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and poetic compression; diction stays within the poet’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature stable: star charts, algae, lantern dimming—all filtered through landscape astrologer gaze. Syntax stays sinuous, mirroring underwater drift; no head-hop.

Minor register lift (“celestial glow,” “calculated wilderness”) is earned by the star-show moment and remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)

    Third-person voice keeps steady distance; diction is clean, lightly archaic (“ziggurats,” “covenant”) but consistent. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional poetic lift (“dusky harmony”) fits tone without over-writing; rhythm stays serviceable but not signature-level. POV knowledge stays inside Kael without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Elara without head-hop; perceptual signature is calm, calculating, slightly lyrical (“faint hum of shifting realities”). Dialogue differentiates Kael’s brittle diction from Elara’s soft cadence; his contraction-heavy scoff contrasts her full-sentence serenity. Filter verbs appear but remain sparse; free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates under pressure: syntax shortens when Kael whispers, mirroring surrender without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is specific to glass-worker: “scent of damp wood and polished glass,” “brass limbs” for sextant anatomy. Rhythm compresses under pressure—short clauses mirror breath count: “She breathed deeply, her inhalation matching the slow rise of the moon.” Syntax glints like glass without purple overload. Register stable; no corporate drift. Final image sustains the lyric cadence, teaching the pattern early and paying it off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains Elara’s perceptual signature: “sunlight filtered through shattered stained glass” is rendered as fractured shards her quartz eyes would catch. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses when she climbs, then longer breaths under the blooming tree. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. One micro-template cadence (“She… She… She…”) in paragraph six, but it coincides with ritual action and therefore reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; diction (“iridescent petals,” “brightened disquiet”) stays inside Elara’s educated-aesthetic lexicon. Perceptual signature—attention to shimmer, breath-hum, mirror-fragments—is distinct and sustained. No dialogue to test spoken idiom, but internal cadence modulates: shorter sentences at revelation beat. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person close sustains consistent perceptual filter (linguist notices “script only she could read”). Syntax is controlled, lightly Latinate without register drift. No dialogue to judge; free indirect style clean. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“air hummed with whispers”) are purposeful, patterned early. Voice modulates slightly under pressure (shorter clauses during trap sequence). No head-hopping or lens slippage.

Filter verbs minimal; metaphor layer dense yet purposeful. Voice never cracks under pressure; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited voice is stable, with a precise, slightly antiquated diction that suits an archivist. Syntax modulates—long, gear-train sentences in calm moments, tighter clauses under pressure—creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping or register drift; the prose itself feels “methodical,” aligning with character.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored in Lira; no head-hop. Prose has rhythmic lift, tactile diction (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “hammered repose”) that feels map-keeperly. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor consistent (sound = light = path). Minor cadence repetition (“gently luminous” used twice) dulls edge but not at closure. Voice distinct enough for 8-band; lacks idiosyncrasy for 9.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s diction (“thistle-blown hope,” “shard of hush”) with poetic compression taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance shortens under stress (“she pressed the shard to her forehead”). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for wonder, staccato for ritual climax. No register drift or committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person tight stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter: ozone scent, caliper chill, fog ripple. Diction poetic yet internally consistent (“stormlit,” “crystalline stones”).

Stable POV, no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a burnished, incantatory cadence that mirrors chant patterns. Diction stays elevated but consistent ("testament to resilience," "ambient awareness"); no POV leakage or sudden jargon. Filter verbs appear only when necessary; perceptual signature is generic-wanderer rather than idiosyncratic. Repetition of "bloom," "light," "chant" is deliberate patterning, not scaffold, and pays off in the final flare.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptions; diction—“celestial tapestry,” “tidal-pool chronicler”—is character-specific, not committee voice. Rhythm swells with cardiac cadence in “hum…resonated in her chest,” mirroring content. No dialogue, so register consistency judged in narration only; no filter-verb clutter. Distinct but not yet unforgettable; missing the idiosyncratic syntax that would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent fairy-tale timber: “xenial trellis,” “intangibly tangible freedom,” compressed but patterned. Syntax modulates—short clauses under inversion, longer reflective ones in bunker—mirroring respiration. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Occasional elevated diction (“gilded hush,” “conceptual repricing”-like phrasing) slightly overshoots child POV, but the affective stance remains coherent and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person single POV stays locked to Elias with clean psychic distance; no filter-verb clusters. Perceptual signature—sound-colored vision, liquid metaphors—remains consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse, naturalistic, goal-driven: Elias’s question intentionally breaks hush to test his own thesis. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences in transit, clipped fragments when vial reacts, mirroring calm versus turbulence.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often serves atmosphere, character, and micro-action (“The vial, a gift from a traveler…was both tool and talisman”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent within light/sound physics. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulting hush,” “prismatic towers”) fits the lyric-tinted mode and is taught early. Final line’s “inner light” avoids overwriting by letting the object speak.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lira; perceptual signature leans on color vocabulary that matches waterfall palette. Syntax remains steady, modest modulation under stress. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction alone—occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant hum,” “conceptual cost”) nudges register toward allegory but holds. Ruby flake personified glow is the one texture tic.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is tactile—scars glimmer, ring hums, darkness “snakes.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during flare: “She gripped… pressed… collapsed.” Filter verbs minimal; one “she could feel” is acceptable. Voice texture distinct but could risk higher register than a lone guardian’s lexicon; “encroaching darkness” verges on literary template diction, holding this sub-8.8.

Rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentence opens, then clipped beats on sand. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs occasional (“she felt”) but voice-motivated. Register stays high-formal without drift. Distinct perceptual signature—cataloguing decay, codes, wind vectors—just shy of 8+ because syntax never buckles under pressure, keeping safe elegance rather than risk.

    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: selective attention to light, texture, and internal “music.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with the gestural rhythm, creating a distinctive cadence without drumbeat monotony. Diction remains within her contemplative register; no corporate register drift. Compression (“she mapped the silence”) is taught by context and pays off at closure, sustaining coherence under poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice maintainsdistance appropriate to mythic tone; diction stays controlled (“ethereal glow,” “frayed but colors still vivid”). No POV slippage or filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates between long atmospheric sentences and short discovery beats, supporting momentum. Voice is not yet unmistakably singular—some phrasing edges toward stock (“labyrinth of forgotten knowledge”)—but remains coherent and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—sound-centric, synesthetic, slightly unreliable. Syntax flexes with emotional swell: longer hyphens and clauses at crescendo, short fragments at beats of awe. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor density high but patterned and taught early. Register stays within POV’s poetic lexicon; no corporate drift. Rhythm propels rather than stalls—read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is steady, third-person close to Eli, with metallic cadence (“rhythmic clangs and shuffles”) that suits the yard. Filter verbs are few; perception stays anchored in Eli’s ears and palms. Diction modestly reflects a worker’s lexicon until “calculated spontaneity,” a phrase that lifts above POV license. Dialogue sparse and indistinct; Mira’s diction merges with narration, no regional or class inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate drifts closer to guardian without slipping into head-hop; perceptual signature is selective attention to reflected light and creaking wood. Syntax is calm, spiraling, long sentences that breathe with the slow reveal. No dialogue beyond stranger’s whispered question—voice remains unobtrusive instrument rather than spoken exchange. Compression in “spiralingly calm” is earned by repetition of spiral motifs; diction stays within guardian’s quiet lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—cobalt, mist, star-whispers—syntax lengthens and softens to mimic hush. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Free-indirect bursts (“as if the very walls were holding their breath”) risk lyric overkill but remain consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments absent—appropriate to single-minded mood.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains salt-stung diction and rhythmic control: “ocean’s breath whispered secrets.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices weight, glint, tide, not tourist vistas.

Turbine drone and wood-scrape supply sonic texture in lieu of speech; register never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    A sustained lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance; diction like “lantern-moth hush” and syntax of cascading prepositional phrases create a textured, atmospheric voice that modulates into quieter farewell. Perceptual signature is consistent—twilight skin-clinging anticipation—without filter-verb drift; only minor cadence loops (“the poet… the poet…”) keep it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person stays tight inside Elias’s perceptual filter: every visual detail is texture, temperature, or motion. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences in calm, shorter clauses when reed vibrates—mirroring musical emergence. Diction remains within a painter’s lexicon (“palette,” “brushstrokes,” “vessels that held light”) without inflation. No head-hop; glassblower’s smile is external observation only. Reed’s personification (“as if stirred by an unseen hand”) is focalized through Elias’s wonder, not narrative contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within Elara’s contemplative register. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful variation in sentence length that mirrors the ebb of sound waves.

No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil; register never drifts into academic distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited holds to Elara’s perceptual signature (“onyx-ink cartomancer,” “swirling like storm clouds”). Diction stays within lexicon; slight register drift toward “economic shock” is absorbable. Rhythm accelerates through data lines without head-hopping. Dialogue minimal and natural; Mira’s exhaustion registers in trembling voice rather than ventriloquy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-bound: “atoms of nostalgia,” “bronze prism pagoda” are neologisms that feel native to Elara’s scholar-idiolect. Syntax elongates under awe—comma-rich cadence mirrors prismatic fracture—then tightens at whisper. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; elision of mirror-reveal is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s dusk-filtered perception; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens with twilight cadence, compresses during vial beat. “Softly deliberate” diction mirrors her trait without self-labeling. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested; perceptual signature strong enough to carry lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is botanical and temporal—“ivy hummed softly,” “meteor hush”—giving the prose a hushed, photosynthetic rhythm. Diction stays within lexicon of a sensitive, memory-fragmented woman; no filter-verb clusters. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during descent, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Occasional lyric uplift (“sanctuary of stillness”) borders poetic but remains consonant with dream-tone; patterned elision (how anesthesia, scars, miracle connect) is taught early and paid off at finale.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter—her skepticism, her tactile attention to frayed edges. Syntax is calm, slightly antique (“palpable,” “frayed”) matching the vintage venue. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; interior voice remains consistent. One lyrical compression—letters “searching for a tune”—is earned by prior sound imagery (projector hum).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Lira’s perceptual filter—“ever-shifting sky,” “whispers of the universe”—with patterned elision taught in line 1 and held to the final cadence. Syntax variegates: long breathless clauses for aurora crescendo, then short fragments (“She rested”). No head-hopping; cosmic voices remain external phenomena, not POV slippage. Register remains within her moonstruck lexicon; brass cold, star-shards, remembered stardust all feel indigenous. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is hush-filtered, synesthetic (cobalt light tastes cold). Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for silence, staccato fragments when fingers hover. No dialogue, so voice carries entire load. One filter-verb cluster (“he noticed… he saw… he understood”) in climax beat costs −0.2, else 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Narrative voice maintains archaic cadence with controlled syntax; “regally unpretentious” mirrors character tension. Perceptual signature is thin—no idiosyncratic filter for a titan scholar; notices are generic (“dust danced”). Dialogue snippet is serviceable but indistinct; no head-hopping. Compression in mosaic beats is readable, pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is marine-biologist precise—“contours erased by time and rising tides”—yet salted with grief. Tapping rhythms create a percussive motif that graduates from nervous habit to epistemic method, then to funeral drum. Psychic distance holds tight third; no filter-verb bloat. Sentence rhythm modulates: longer reflective rolls contract into staccato realizations, mirroring her cognitive assembly. Distinctive perceptual signature sustained under pressure; elision is minimal and pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, diction kept within Lira’s star-minded lexicon—“slivers of daylight,” “shimmering thread woven into the fabric.” Rhythm swells with hum-intensity, sentences lengthen then contract, mirroring thunderous serenity. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Perceptual signature is strong: she sees star-patterns where others see junk, and that bias governs every descriptive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is trauma-angled—“salt carried the scent of… memories that haunted” privileges olfactory hyper-vigilance over visual panorama. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, then fractures into clipped clauses during the slip—“time seemed to stand still”—mirroring cardiac slowdown of somatic freeze. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s painter-perception: palette dormant, colors of cards sorted, lantern glow as unseen pigment. Syntax lengthens in calmer library beats, shortens on staircase ascent, mirroring breath. No dialogue to judge; interior idiom avoids therapy-register. “Luminescent ache” repetition is deliberate pattern, not template cadence, and pays off in final line. Satisfies 9+ quick test for perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s desert-tracker perception: “wind-sculpted sand,” “metallic wings glinting,” sensory hierarchies feel profession-specific. Syntax flexes under pressure—“time itself seemed to bend”—without POV leakage. Dialogue is brief but carries subtext (ink as mirror). Voice keeps calm surface while anger pulses, matching serene-anger tone request.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is serviceable—“cryogenic archivist” notices data strata and silence—but diction defaults to Latinate abstractions (“conceptualized,” “network’s activation”) that flatten voice under stress. Rhythm is steady, not modulated to the download frenzy; no fragment burst or clause compression. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it leans on adjective-noun pairs (“endless fall,” “vast halls”) that feel template-generated. Still, no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close sustains Elara’s tactile perceptual signature; diction stays within farmer-pacifist lexicon. Rhythm breathes—long reflective sentences in garden, shorter beats at intrusion. No dialogue artifacts; sparse speech carries subtext. Filter verbs minimal and motivated; no head-hop. Voice modulation under stress: “heart tightened” is short, immediate, before returning to calm cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence; diction stays within Kael’s perceptual orbit (“calloused hands,” “nets and lines”).

Prose rhythm modulates, turning staccato during discovery beats. Dialogue (with director) is brief, laced with veiled inquiry; voices remain distinct. Filter verbs minimal; voice never slips into editorial gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)

No dialogue, hence no convergence issue. Patterned repetition of “interjected,” “emergent hush” is taught early and paid off in closure. Psychic distance modulates with pressure. Micro-pressurised syntax under final beat. Minor: occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) but stays within poetic licence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; diction leans poetic but remains in character for a retrocognitive visionary. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for memory, shorter fragments for tactile beats. Filter verbs crop up (“seemed to whisper”) but align with her spectral mindset. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence is consistent, if occasionally lulled into template parallelism.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is lush, theatrical, synesthetic—“whispers a symphony, each shadow a memory”—yet stays anchored in Mara’s perception. Patterned diction (“the stage was set…”) is consistent and pays off in the closing line. No dialogue, hence no register clash. Occasional elevated phrasing (“synesthetic currents,” “conceptual repricing”) flirts with exceeding ghost-POV lexicon but remains legible. Rhythm modulates with long vowel cadences that mimic night-bloom opening; no algorithmic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Free-indirect voice stays close to Elara’s perceptual filters—“fractally precise edges,” “willowglass hope”—diction precise yet not purple. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for nocturnal sweep, clipped fragments when she positions gear. No dialogue, so no voice-drift. Patterned diction (“fractally precise” repeated) is taught early and repaid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person narration maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature is attentive to texture (“damp earth,” “veins perfectly preserved”). Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “as if” clauses that mirror mapping’s speculative logic. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register drifts slightly elevated for a fieldworker (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) but stays within plausible interior lexicon of a mystic cartographer.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays consistently anchored in Elara’s perceptual filter: “sunlight filtering through the dust” is what she notices, not omniscient scene-setting. Syntax lengthens under calm sorting, then compresses at the climax (“glass trembled, echo swelling”), mirroring pressure. No dialogue appears, so no voice contamination. The occasional elevated diction (“deliberate grace,” “crystallized final moment”) nudges register slightly above occupational vernacular but remains internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature favors metallic, hushed, winter lexis. Sentence rhythm modulates with breathless climb versus longer reflective cadences. No dialogue to distort. Metaphor density (“silver hush,” “forgotten veil”) is high but patterned and taught early; closure line repeats “silver and gold,” fulfilling pattern. Slight risk of purple in “mist clung…like a forgotten veil,” but internal logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“spindrift serenity,” “percolate”) borders on mannered but stays coherent. Rhythm modulates with fog imagery; no head-hop. Dialogue brief, serviceable, subtext thin. Voice distinctive enough for venue, not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter—“sharp gentleness” is her kinetic register, not authorial flourish. Syntax mirrors pottery rhythm: long coil-like sentences build, then a single chip-short clause when glass aligns. No head-hopping; chimney smoke and bee-shadows are noticed only as her attention snags them. Diction stays within her ceramic lexicon—”thrummed,” “etched,” “fired”—no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Narrative voice sustains a consistent lyric third-person close, weighted toward poetic catalog (“luminous harbor,” “mirror,” “quivering hush”) that suits Elara’s wistful lens. Syntax varies, lines breathe, and no filter-verb clusters gum the immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but tonally aligned; no head-hop or register drift. The slight surplus of abstract qualifiers (“peculiar stillness,” “protected vulnerability”) prevents full texture punch but keeps the read aloud smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains steady perceptual signature—Elena filters world through relic scholarship, noticing etchings, hum frequencies, twin-sun reflections. Sentence rhythm swells then compresses during orb-contact, mirroring sensory flood. No dialogue, so voice coherence rides on diction control: avoidances of cliché, Latinate clutter, and template cadence throughout. Filter verbs are minimal and justified; no head-hop or register drift. Distinctive enough to meet 9- gate minus the hairline abstraction in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, almost F-I: “the spiral seemed to hum…” mirrors her cadence of noticing. Syntax lengthens and breathes with semicolons when she gazes, then clips at the moment of fit—“the moment it touched…” No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent and lyrically specific. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; no corporate drift. A hairline slip—“known for weaving words that mended broken hearts” is slightly brochure-like, but it is the only canned line in 700+ words.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature—“celestial signal interpreter”—colors every noticing with spectrograph jargon that never drifts into lay condescension. Rhythm accelerates into staccato clauses during activation beat, then exhales, mirroring signal distortion. Dialogue from Hank is utilitarian, contrasting her elliptical interior voice without convergence. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice sustains a lyrical, night-lit register—whisper, reverberation, shard-glow—without purple drift. Syntax compresses under stress (“She squeezed… shoulders brushing”) then elongates during wonder, mirroring emotional respiration. Perceptual signature is sharp: Elara notices distance by breath-scent and stone temperature, never tourist catalog. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the lone POV stays modest (no organ-exposition dump) and reliably interior.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is textured, painterly, with rhythmic alternation of long breathy sentences and hammered fragments (“She stepped back…crunching on gravel”).

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close stays latched to Elara’s perception; diction favors precise meteorological lexis (“barometers,” “jet stream”) without jargon drift. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under crackling light, longer reflective cadences afterward. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.

Voice never strains for lyricism, maintaining credible compression.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent cosmic diction and rhythmic uplift; perceptual signature is star-directed and chronicler-detached. Compression in peak beats (“She scribbled notes furiously”) keeps momentum. No dialogue to test naturalism.

Register stays elevated but plausible for a word-healer; no head-hopping or distance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Eira’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“moss-covered ground,” “flesh-eating plant seed”—is concrete, non-generic.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature: verbs of vegetal motion (“hedges seemed to pulse”) mirror Elara’s vegetal bond. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She pressed on, her curiosity fueling her determination”—yet avoids drumbeat through interwoven prepositional variation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature saturated with auditory metaphors consistent with ex-roadie ear. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses for reverie, staccato fragments for dawning decision. No head-hopping. Filter verbs (“seemed”) are voice-motivated hesitation, not leakage. Read-aloud cadence controlled without algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Eliara; perceptual signature leans scholarly (“cuneiform scripts,” “analogical thinking”) and rhythmic control is steady. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose is clean, occasionally formal but consistent. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrative voice carries hushed precision—spectacles, bamboo creel, wintersun—syntax lengthens under contemplation then tightens during ritual. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb clusters. Perceptual signature biased to archival attention: walls “breathe,” runes “catalogue” themselves. Dialogue absent by design; interior monologue stays librarian-specific without academic drift. Rhythm modulates with tide imagery, read-aloud cadence intact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a resonant hush throughout—“resonant hush of the crystal caves” returns as final promise. Syntax ripples with alliteration and cadenced clauses that mirror cave echoes. No filter-verb clutter; perception stays embodied. Diction never exceeds Elara’s plausible lexicon, and the choral climax modulates voice without breaking texture.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “rusted tracks gleezing” is an idiosyncratic verb choice that feels river-chronicler specific. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for ivy entry, clipped fragments when she touches her self-map—mirroring breath under stress. No head-hopping; the man’s dialogue is exterior-only, voice distinct in its gruff kindness. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she felt a strange sense…”) and are paid off by embodied follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric is stable, no head-hop. Perceptual signature is mist-and-light obsessed, filtering every observation through hush, glow, hum; diction stays inside that register. Rhythm swells with propagation cadence—“each shelf she passed added a layer”—then tightens into single-clause final exit, mirroring urgency. No dialogue to distort voice; only the symbolic writing intrudes, and it is appropriately alien (shifting glyphs), not ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and POV-strict: “velvet observatory,” “perforated destiny,” and “mulberry ache” form a private lexicon that never leaks into explanatory exposition. Syntax swells and contracts with tension—long, scent-laden clauses collapse into the staccato “Propagate. Protect. Prevail.” No head-hop, no filter-verb fat, and the faint archaic diction suits the fable-frame without sounding costume-shop.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: attention to shimmer, breath, hush. Compression is purposeful—“radiant hush” repeats as rhythmic motif, pattern-taught early and reprised at close. Syntax modulates from longer incantatory sentences to fragment-like calm at the end, mirroring stillness theme. Dialogue is minimal and archaic, fitting traveler archetype without flattening; narrative diction stays within Elara’s refined lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person lyric stays stable; diction favors soft consonants and long vowels (“vineyard hush,” “luminous lake”) that match the hush tone. Rhythm is fluid, but sentence openings repeat “The…,” “She…” templates that dull propulsion. Perceptual signature is limited: Elara notices light and mist, never texture, weight, or temperature, so voice is atmospheric rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked on Elias; perceptual signature is crisp—mirror “reflecting nothing” mirrors his client’s void. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences contract into staccato chime transcriptions, tracking rising interpretive stress. Diction stays within coastal-dweller register; no academic leakage. Free indirect style is clean: “he felt the weight of its symbolism” is filtered through his sensibility, not authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is steady, contemplative, scientist-poet hybrid; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon (“magnetic grotto,” “reverse flow”). Rhythm lengthens in trance, shortens at stone impacts, mirroring ripple expansion. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Occasional elevated cadence (“sycamore hush”) feels earned by lyric mode rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled archaic cadence (‘a civilization that had mastered the art of stillness’) without lapsing into purple overload; perceptual signature is consistent—sound, dust, vibration—under peak pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; elision of time is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, tidal cadence that mirrors harbor ambiance. Perceptual signature centers on light, metal temperature, and water hush—specific and consistent. No dialogue to test naturalism; narration stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person ventriloquizes Lira’s idiosyncratic attention—“stars whispered secrets in static bursts”—syntax stays compressed, scientific diction (“distillation apparatus”) filtered through awe. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for reflection, staccato for burst climax. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs are minimal and earned. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, modulating syntax from long reflective sentences to spare imperatives during ritual. Diction—“shards of light,” “spiraling upward”—remains within a reaper’s mythic register without purple drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices tactile cold, star order, monster anatomy, all filtered through bereaved attention, sustaining a textured lyric voice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited clings to Eliard’s sensory filter: “lukewarm mage” is never spelled out academically, preserving modest lexicon. Rhythm mimics droplet cadence—short sentence clusters then longer lyrical lifts. No dialogue to judge; free-indirect stays clean. Voice remains consistent; no head-hop or register drift. Final line lightens prosody to match uplifted stance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature: “precisely humane,” “glassy surface,” “pinholes in a dark cloth”—diction calibrated to a watchman’s measured gaze. Rhythm pulses: long twilight sentences contract into staccato morning beats when townspeople gather, mirroring emotional crescendo. No dialogue to test voice separation, yet narration never slips into committee-speak. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy holds.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature favors light, motion, and spiral forms—consistent alchemist-eye. Rhythm breathes with scene pace; no head-hopping or register drift. Syntax is competent but safe; lacks daring compression or sonic pattern that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; perceptual signature is consistent—metallic gleam, cloud geometry, muscle-memory tingle—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful inversion (“the midnight pattern seeker, attuned…”) that sustakes nocturnal rhythm. Diction stays within poetic-techno register the POV can plausibly own. No dialogue to test, so voice cohesion rests on narrative texture alone.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual lens; no head-hop. Prose texture—cool glass / void breath / pulse—mirrors thawing interior. Minor register drift: “vivify” and “complementary opposites” sound seminar-room, but occur outside peak duel beats. Rhythm accelerates with short parry lines, breathes in final void silence, supporting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-limited stays locked on Elias with no head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches”—a calm, analytical diction fitting puzzle-designer. Syntax is controlled, rhythms vary, no filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“nocturnal haven,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authorial rather than character-bound, but never breaks lens; dialogue absent, so no voice-convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric remains close to Eli’s perceptual filter: “worn smooth…felt alive,” “jagged, imperfect,” mirror his cracked interior. Syntax stretches and compresses with breath-like cadence; no drumbeat patterns. Diction stays within plausibly Eli’s—no academic register intrudes. Patterned repetition (“mourfully eager,” “off-key wind”) is taught early and pays off in final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person tight maintains consistent psychic distance; diction—“shards of obsidian,” “folded light”—stays within alien-librarian lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure: short clauses when keeper approaches. No head-hopping; keeper’s interior withheld appropriately. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue sparse but goal-driven, carries subtext of ownership and exile. Syntax mirrors feral alertness: clauses coil, then release in refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric achieves consistent atmospheric distance; diction stays within a plausible alchemist lexicon. Rhythm swells intentionally during the chant, then contracts to short clauses for the sapling release, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature favors thermal and mineral imagery that feels character-bound rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent atmospheric cadence; diction tilts poetic but stays within Elara’s technical sensibility (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”). Rhythm modulates—long vowel echoes mimic radio static, tightening during tuning beats. No dialogue to test; perceptual signature is coherent if not idiosyncratic. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory immediacy dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance; diction favors soft consonants and starlit imagery that suits the spectral tone. Syntax loosens under pressure—“world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds”—but remains coherent. Distinct perceptual signature is moderate; Mara filters the world through nautical pattern-recognition, but interior cadence doesn’t differentiate markedly from the narrator’s.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person floats close to sensorium: “she felt the shift in her chest” keeps psychic distance tight. Diction is fevered yet precise—“sinew thread,” “rational enchantment”—mirroring her architect mind. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, rhythmic; one template cadence runs (“she… she… she…”) across three openers, but it accidentally mimics loom rhythm—readable as pattern, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Narrative voice is calm, pedagogical, slightly oceanic—fitting a navigation instructor. Free indirect diction (“obsolete?” she echoed, her voice sharp) carries emotional spikes without leaving Elara’s perceptual orbit. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory hierarchy favors tactile and visual cues aligned with her vocation. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Kael’s tentative softness contrasts with Elara’s clipped resolve. Rhythm stays steady; an occasional template cadence (“They say… They think…”) is present but not intrusive enough to dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Elara; perceptual signature filters through professional tracer lens (“faint pulses,” “breadcrumb”). Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with strategic breath-length variation. No dialogue to test naturalism; diction remains within plausible lexicon. No head-hopping or distance drift; lyric compression is consistent and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person POV stays close to Elena’s perceptual filter: headlamp cone, salt taste, narrowing tunnel. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under stress, syntax shortening. “Crashing hush” refrain risks ornament but is justified as tidal heartbeat. No dialogue to test, so voice distinctness rests on sensory selectivity, which holds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with solitary astronomer; perceptual signature—“opal dome frosted like forgotten relic,” “galaxies in miniature.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences under pressure, short clause at dawn release. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs minimal; occasional abstraction (“the universe was trying to communicate”) forgiven by lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close stays tightly fused to Lena’s perceptual filter—notice of spore scent, finger-on-flint texture. Rhythm compresses under pressure: “She clutched… heart pounding.” No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows precisely. Diction slightly elevated but consistent with researcher POV. Dialogue limited to two distorted words; still carry subtext. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor controlled (“gravitationally playful” taught early).

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct—star-wood violin “breathes,” statues “scan,” heartbeat “merges with roots”—and rhythm accelerates under pressure without monotony. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens cleanly to her chest-cavity pulse. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, never clustered.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyrical third-person tight to Elias sustains a consistent, slightly elegiac diction—“brittle hush,” “ghostly echo”—that modulates shorter syntax under chase pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is biased toward mechanical sounds and temperature, fitting a courier-tinkerer. Dialogue is absent, correctly omitted rather than forced.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays pinned to carpenter’s perceptual bias—wood grain, wind-bell pitch, pocket heat—without POV drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for discovery. No forced poetic diction; imagery grows from occupational detail (“wood into dreams”). Filter verbs minimal; the “misting hush” refrain is patterned compression, paid off in final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: equations “hum,” moonlight “catches faded emerald,” reflecting her math-poet hybrid mind. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for stacking, staccato “library trembled” for fold-moment. No head-hopping; patrons remain silhouettes, preserving POV distance. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator meta-language, not in her lexicon, but it occurs outside narration; internal diction stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through chromatic vocabulary (cerulean, muted hues, shimmering) consistent with painter-librarian lens. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses at dawn swell, short fragments at shutter click mimic intake of breath. No head-hopping; filter verbs (“she noticed”) are motivated by photographic noticing. Voice remains individual, avoiding lyrical committee-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric register; diction stays within Elara’s poetic ken. Rhythm modulates—long breath for nexus, clipped for lock-click—without algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual bandwidth; no head-hop. Diction is precise—“luminescence,” “chronically curious”—yet remains within a folklorist’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in greenhouse, clipped fragments under sky-alignment pressure. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt a shift”) is allowable at climax; voice remains coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: ‘scent that both comforted and suffocated’ is character-specific, not tourist-catalog. Syntax mirrors her nervy precision—comma-rich, breathless clauses when shadow ‘presses her into the chair’. No head-hopping; tea-leaf lexicon stays within her scholarly register. Free-indirect slips are clean: ‘She knew that reversible exile was…a promise’ is tagged with her certainty, not narrator assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, meditative cadence that matches the “radiant hush” tone; diction stays within Elara’s orchard-world lexicon. Repetition of “radiant hush” risks incantatory overkill but reads as deliberate patterning. No dialogue occurs, so voice contamination issues are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors glints, fray, salt, hush—restorer’s sensory lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-visual—“rain-scoured,” “grooves,” “frame by frame”—consistent with map-framer’s profession. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for excavation accumulation, clipped fragments for strike moment (“wood, ancient and preserved”). No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on narrative voice; register stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon save for one elevated phrase (“masterpiece of endurance”) that momentarily surfaces. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hop or filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Free-indirect diction—“quiet reminder of something she couldn’t quite name”—carries scientist precision fused with melancholy drift. Perceptual signature filters environment through archaeological priorities: she notices brittleness of paper before color of ink. Rhythm modulates from long clause-cadences of cataloguing to fragment-like final line (“lullaby”) that mimics breath released. No head-hopping; distance stable; non-standard punctuation absent, so no deductions apply.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium with rhythmic cadence—“weaving tales of forgotten realms and lost loves” carries balladeer idiom. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices sound, shimmer, etched light. Diction is elevated but fits mythic tone; no register drift under pressure. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; diction (“fractally precise,” “seep into the very bones”) matches Elara’s hyper-detailed perception. Rhythm clusters short clauses under pressure, then elongates during craft; no template cadence. No dialogue, so only internal voice is judged—consistent, faintly archaic, scholar-guild diction sustained. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to” ×3) keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight stays anchored in Elara’s perceptual filters—brass gleam, dog-ear fray, engine hum—without leakage. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She smiled, her sociable isolation melting away”) mirroring breathless ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistent, no head-hop. Prose leans lyrical—long vowel loops, soft consonants—matching orchard hush. Diction drifts slightly elevated (“brambled hope,” “celestial phenomenon”) but remains in register with mythic tone taught early. Dialogue is absent, so voice test is narrative only; rhythm modulates between hush and bell clang without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “pane of hush,” “bruised awe,” rhythmic anaphora mimic lullaby cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) feels ritual-apt rather than intrusive; compression taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays chemist-tight: diction “symphonically,” “molecular,” no head-hop. Rhythm accelerates at foam-beat via short sensory clauses. Free indirect clean: “she thought of her brother” slides into italic-free memory. No dialogue = no voice convergence; internal cadence mirrors river pulse. Meets 9+ quick minus hairline: one clause edges academic (“conceptual harmony”) but fits POV.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“store’s very first opening day,” “vial… pulsating with a rhythm that seemed to echo the clouds”—carries a hushed, glass-bright timbre consistent throughout. Syntax elongates for ascent, shortens at incision, mirroring breath. Dialogue absent, so voice reliance on cadence and image is correct. Occasional soft filler (“seemed to”) prevents top-band crispness but does not leak artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s palate-centric perception; diction (“sandpaper rough memories,” “coral icebound”) remains within her sensory lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during corridor tasting, then slows for final absorption. No dialogue, so voice purity uncontested. Filter verbs (“she knew,” “she felt”) are sparse and motivated by tasting mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays stable and filtered through Elara’s engineer-perceiver: “synaptic plasticity,” “fractured relic,” etc. Syntax modulates—long breathless cadence for memory vines, shorter clauses at the shard setting—without losing clarity. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction remains within her plausible lexicon. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to come alive”) is minor enough to keep high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person tight stays inside Elara’s prism-filter; perceptual signature (“kaleidoscope of fragmented knowledge”) governs syntax and image choice.

No dialogue to break voice; no head-hopping; filter verbs are few and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited adheres to Alara’s sensorium; no head-hop. Lexicon—“magnetic nexus,” “eclipsed covenant,” “thoughtfully precise”—stays within a scholar-tutor’s idiom. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for twilight ambience, staccato fragments during knight-sacrifice. No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate. Voice is distinct enough to risk 9.0, but one clause (“she sought to prove that silence could be a bridge”) edges toward thesis-statement; a shaved 0.1 for that micro-lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Intuitively descriptive voice sustains a distinctive perceptual signature: synesthetic “tuning frequencies,” starlight as audible. Syntax elongates during coaxing, then contracts at the click, rhythm echoing pulse. No dialogue to distort; interior diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “appeared”) are sparing and motivated by her receptive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Diction is florid yet consistent with her sensuous world (“olfactorily sensitive,” “wildflower hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“hazy precision,” “rusted edges catching glow”) matches tonal brief; rhythm tightens under flashlight sweep; no dialogue hence no voice convergence—perceptual signature remains consistent, legible, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s synesthetic channel; no head-hop. Diction stays within her perceptual lexicon—“liquid sunlight,” “sharpened teeth”—creating rhythmic, sensory prose. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate. One register lift (“promise of stillness”) is poetic but consistent with lyric mode taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-limited voice is stable, syntactically controlled, with nice sonic repeats (“echoed softly… avalanchingly quiet”). Perceptual signature is generic epic-fantasy rather than individuated; filter verbs minimal, but metaphors are stock (“sky seemed to crackle”). No dialogue; therefore voice distinction and dialogue tests N/A. Compression is purposeful; elisions teach the hush pattern; no artifacts intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited voice is steady, lyrical, syntactically varied; perceptual signature fixates on light, texture, pulse. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Register tilts slightly academic (“transposed empathy,” “mathematics of emotion”) but stays within obsessive craftsperson lexicon. Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences in calm, fragments at surge—without algorithmic pattern. No head-hop or filter-verb clusters; interior texture remains coherent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is steady—she notices wind-chill, wing-glint, mentor-echoes. Syntax modulates with stress: short paratactic bursts at crest of ridge. No dialogue voice to judge; register remains within plausible courier diction. Filter verbs minimal; “seemed to shift” is earned uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual grammar: “the shifted hush,” “faint hum,” “language of frost.” Syntax lengthens under meditative pressure, then fractures into shorter beats when grief hits.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric third-person stays close to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“liquid gold,” “raveling silence”) is consistent, rhythm modulates with cadence of weaving. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature is present but not pushed to razor specificity under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-limited stays stable; sensory diction (“ripe fruit and molten metal”) is character-specific and rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is color-centric (indigo, saffron, amber, gold) consistent with dye-master vocation. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences calm, short pulses (“He could feel…”) cue gift activation. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interiority avoids filter verbs. Register stays literary but within plausible artisan lexicon; no mechanical cadence. Closure image keeps distance intact.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with clean psychic distance; perceptual signature (“tool belt,” “dusty table,” corridor acoustics) is quietly vocational. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for awe, clipped fragments for discovery—without overwriting; no POV leaks or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistently mythic-lyric; syntax stays long and incantatory, mirroring fairy-tale distance. No dialogue, so no convergence issues.

No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within rural-botanic lexicon. Final paragraph modulates to softer cadence as light fades, achieving Charged Poise without register drift.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lean and sensory-dense; most sentences do two jobs (air “thick with scent” + season marker). Minor loop: “bread…bread…bread” thrice in paragraph 3, but each mention reweights meaning, so waived. Metaphors stay physical (ivy “choked out light”) and consistent. One paraphrase pair (“fragile…fragile”) adjacent; −0.2. Closure line varies rhythm and lands clean—no artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Narrative voice maintains a hushed, crystalline register that mirrors the quartz hush tone; syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly archaic (“gently meticulous care”) without purple drift.

    Lyrical third-person floats cleanly above Clara without head-hop; perceptual signature leans toward antiquarian noticing (“tarnished but its allure undeniable”). Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Mrs. Ellis’s cadence is older, gnomic. Register stays within curator’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric maintains distanced awe, syntax lengthening during submerged description, then fragmenting mid-dance: “Her body began to move, fluid and deliberate”—rhythm mimics tide.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited adheres tightly to Eli’s sensory funnel; diction stays within a dock-worker’s register (“adjusted the wick,” “brush against”). Rhythm echoes lighthouse cadence—steady, then a hush—supporting “gleaming silence” tone. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Occasional poetic lift (“memories floated like fragments of light”) is justified by climax’s lyric height.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent arched cadence; diction stays within a mystic register (“terrestrially cosmic”) without glitch. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices current, scent, fold tension in summoner-specific hierarchy. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unchallenged; minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) are acceptably sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person hovers close to Clara; perceptual signature is plant- and scent-oriented (“scents mingling with the faint hum”).

Compression in peak beat—“the image shifted”—is clean, though register flirts with profundity: starlight figure speaks in “countless others.” Overall, voice is distinct, rhythm controlled, and elision taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric close to Elara; perceptual signature relies on frosty phrasing (“borrowed starlight,” “fragments of others’ stories”). Rhythm controlled, no head-hop. Free indirect style clean; register stays within her mystic lexicon. Dialogue absent; voice sustains atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: selective attention to cool bamboo, jasmine lift, firefly flicker. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her contemplative tempo; no filter-verb clutter. Diction skews lyrical—“scintillatingly somber,” “moon paths”—but matches her philosopher cast. Voice is consistent and recognizable; slight risk of ambient poetese is checked by tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“gnarled trees heavy with fruit” is her scrutiny, not author tour. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She pressed… scream”) mirroring pulse rise. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Diction stays within wasteland scavenger lexicon; no sudden academic lifts. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful (“she felt a faint hum”).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic, slightly elevated diction fitting obsessive seer. Sensory selectivity (radio static, glass hum, lightning glare) stays in Elias’s perceptual register; no filter-verb glut. No dialogue, so voice carries full load without contamination. Minor template cadence (“He saw… He saw…”) in vision paragraph dulls propulsion but does not corrupt closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“penny poet,” “sweeten the silence”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, breathy sentences during capture, staccato shards when the box erupts. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Psychic distance compresses credibly under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; perceptual signature is crystalline winter engineering diction—“lantern room’s mechanism,” “vibrational matching”—that melts into syntactic shivers during peaks. No filter-verb clusters; rhythm accelerates up the spiral stairs then fragments during harmonic combat, mirroring pulse. Dialogue line from antagonist carries subtextual seduction rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays faithful to Elara’s perceptual grammar: horizon sweep, lunar angle calculations, iron’s cold hum. Distinctive syntactic pattern—“softly purposeful,” “restrained wildness”—creates rhythmic signature without monotony. No dialogue, so voice carries through filtered observation; diction (“unyoke,” “viaduct”) stays within cartographer lexicon. Compression in visitor paragraph drifts toward template cadence (“they came… she met… they too began”), a minor artifact holding the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited holds without leakage; diction stays within Elara’s forensic perceptual register (“angle of the marks,” “residue of metal”). Lantern flicker as rhythmic refrain is purposeful rather than algorithmic. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough for the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—scriptural cadence in “hands folded aptly deliberate,” sensory tilt toward scent and metallic gleam. Syntax lengthens under moral pressure, then fractures into shorter clauses at exit, mirroring resolve. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence. Filter verbs minimal; brass “gleaming faintly” is perception, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is crisp, tech-adjacent, faintly noir: “digital expanse,” “metadata,” “frayed fabric”—all suit a corporate archivist. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short clauses mirror lockout urgency; longer sentences return during song analysis. No head-hopping, psychic distance steady. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“Access denied. Data purged.”) and carries subtext of corporate cover-up. Slight cadence repetition in “she realized… she decided…” but not enough to dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is atmospheric, not idiolectic. Prose textures (“air thick with aged wood and dust”) modulate cadence without drumbeat. No dialogue to test separation; internal voice avoids filter-verb drift.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric adheres to Elara’s perceptual bias: ice “like broken teeth,” parasol “catching the pale light.” Syntax lengthens in calm, fractures under aurora, mirroring loosening then firming grip. No head-hop; Mara and man remain opaque, as required. Diction stays within educated-traveler lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays stable inside Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax is smooth, lightly lyrical, matching contemplative mood. Diction stays within accessible register; occasional soft phrases (“golden hues blending seamlessly”) border on brochure but don’t rupture voice. Perceptual signature is present—she notices agricultural symmetries and social gaps—yet rhythmic distinctiveness is moderate rather than arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close sustains Elara’s perceptual signature—peripheral flickers, mask brush, whisper hum—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax flexes from lyrical elongated phrases to clipped ritual utterance, mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so voice coherence is intra-focal. Diction stays within wanderer-poet register; “consecrate,” “conjured,” “kinetic” feel native to world rather than thesaurus splash.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, cadenced rhythm that mirrors Elara’s calm; clause-length variation is deliberate and read-aloud musical. Perceptual signature is sharp—“dove gray map case” as extension of body, noticing “arcs” in monochrome contrast—without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture, which remains coherent and distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is scholarly, auditory, slightly archaic (“testify to what he heard”) without register drift. Rhythm lengthens in calmer passages, shortens under crystal vibration, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on internal diction; occasional nominal padding (“phenomenon he had spent years studying”) slightly dulls immediacy but not enough to breach 7-floor.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s perceptual sieve; no head-hop. Diction—“precognitively forgetful,” “sieve for the future”—is character-specific and consistent. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for foggy drift, then short beats when he kneels or drops chalk. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is direct (“he heard it—a faint, resonant hum”). Meets 9+ quick test: perceptual signature is unmistakable and paid off in final vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: she hears a leaf that may not exist, feels altitude as “luminous ache,” notices gears “intact yet unwound.” Syntax elongates in calmer moments, then fragments during quake (“a pull—something—”). No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Voice-specific diction—“changelessly constant,” “escape velocity” used as metaphor—remains consistent and justified by her sage-tech worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elara without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature is pleasant but generic—“soft, eternal glow,” “delicate blend”—lacking idiosyncratic sensorium of a musician. Rhythm is smooth, sentences varied; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue is sparse yet natural when present; Claire’s single line reads credibly. Voice does not scale under pressure because no pressure is allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited sustains calm, scholarly perceptual signature: “echoes of a forgotten song,” “faint resonance.” No head-hop; syntax tightens under pressure (“key clutched tightly”). Dialogue absent by design; voice remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “weight…resting heavy,” “boots crunching.” Syntax is smooth, lyrical, with purposeful repetition of “mistakes into constellations” that teaches the pattern. No dialogue, so voice remains consistent; diction within plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering every detail through Lira’s synesthetic bias (salt-scent = childhood cliff, glass weight = memory mass). Rhythmic control peaks in the polishing sequence—short clauses mimic circular strokes—without syntactic monotony; perceptual signature is consistent and paid off in the final image of cloak-mist following her upslope.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is color-attuned (“emerald,” “amber,” “dappled”) and texture-obsessed, matching her need to embroider decay into beauty. Rhythm escalates toward shorter clauses when Kai appears, then exhales into longer, hushed cadences at close. No head-hopping; Kai’s interiority is inferred only through externals. Free indirect style is clean: “the honeyed hush was no longer just a feeling—it was a shared language” reads as her thought, not authorial nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited adheres strictly to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction is lyrical but disciplined—“feral nexus,” “barnacles to a rock”—texture mirrors protagonist’s writerly lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third lyrical-omniscient voice sustains rhythmic cadence that mirrors incantation; diction stays within fairy-tale register. No filter-verb clutter; perception remains tethered to Elara’s noticing. Syntax modulates with luminosity crescendo. One template loop—“golden” appears four times in eighty words—dulls final sparkle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter—calloused fingers, frost bite, the hush of crater air—producing a distinct tactile signature. Syntax stretches and compresses with her patience, never drifting into academic or generic registers. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation is confined to narrative texture, which sustains lyric compression without purple overload. The few Latinate abstractions (“constellations,” “conceptual”) are justified by her alchemical vocation, maintaining plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited clings to Elias’s tactile, angle-obsessed perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“peripherally focused,” gear-hum rhythm). Syntax mirrors tinkering—short clauses for clicks, longer spirals for reflections. No dialogue to distort voice; free-indirect hum runs clean. Register stays within a self-taught artisan’s lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the breakthrough dusk beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyrical voice sustains whalebone reverie cadence—long vowels, cavernous consonants—without slipping into purple overload. Perceptual signature is Elara-tilted: air “thick,” starlight a “mosaic,” burner a “grounding force.” No POV leakage; figure’s speech stays alien, whale-boned, distinct. Compression in peak beat mirrors her held breath, then releases.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“rust-hued peace,” “rain-beaded”) is specific yet consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses during reflection, clipped fragments during carving. No dialogue to test voice distinction; no POV slippage. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) sits outside her lexis, but isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric carries a distinct perceptual signature: ears strain for “rhythms no one could hear,” eyes track “faint gleam” amid mud. Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses for lagoon shimmer, staccato fragments when static voice hits. No head-hopping; compression (“She began to walk…”) is taught early and paid off in final step.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Eli; perceptual signature is restrained engineer-POV—“redirected flows,” “patterns in chaos”—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for survey, clipped fragments when “idea struck.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stays within intern lexicon; occasional elevated phrases (“relic of a bygone era”) read as permitted lyric uplift rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close sustains a consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices tactile minutiae (cool damp stone, excruciatingly gentle pen stroke) and screens out tourist detail. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful compression—“glacial hush,” “crystal whispering”—that teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off in the final “home” whisper. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to her trembling breaths. Register remains within an introverted artisan’s lexicon; no corporate drift or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid—“brass surface etched with intricate patterns that seemed to whisper secrets of time”—without filter-verb bloat. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for canal description, clipped clauses during salvage. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction remains within POV lexicon. Slight lyrical uniformity in sentence openers keeps this from 9.0, but texture is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric-accumulative voice taught early: “oceanic hush,” “snow-muffled planks,” maintained to last line. Perceptual signature is patient, haptic, tuned to micro-fractals. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Rhythm breathes with scene’s contemplative tempo; compression and patterned diction remain legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited voice is steady, modest, slightly archaic ("lonesome splendor") yet never purple. Rhythm lengthens and contracts with the widow's breathing; syntactic parallelism in the obituary passage mirrors liturgy, teaching the pattern early and paying off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tied to traveler's tactile noticing (crunch, scent, thread weight). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated ("she began to observe").

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Kael; no head-hopping. Diction—“bedraggled,” “luminescent fungi,” “quaking reverie”—is consistent and atmospheric, with rhythmic variation that mirrors his fatigue then flicker of hope. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from wide establishing shot to intimate tactile moment at the pedestal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric-accumulative voice: long cadenced sentences mirror cloud migration; diction stays volcanic-�“obsidian,” “black sand,” “sterile”�—rooted in Elara’s sensory lexicon. No dialogue, so vocal identity rests in the textured interior monologue that tightens into shorter clauses at the burial beat, teaching the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through Elara’s skeptical, moon-lit attention (“as if they carried their own moon”). Syntax swells and contracts with discovery, then compresses at mirror-moment. No dialogue appears, so no voice-convergence issue. One clause drifts toward academic register—“sidereal patience”—but it is taught early and repaid at closure, keeping the prose within 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, slightly elevated register that matches Elara’s ethereal POV; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature favors chromatic and tactile diction (“liquid silver,” “quiet sigh”) that differentiates the narrator from generic omniscience. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of “sonar pinging” without syntactic monotony. Dialogue is absent by design; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person intimate stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter—glass hums like stone “sings,” butterflies are “fleeting syntax.” No head-hop; spectral mentor kept externalized through memory and reported speech. Syntax mirrors carving rhythm—short clauses when chisel moves, longer accumulating sentences during reflection. Diction remains artisanal (veins, fracture, etch) without thesaurus drift. Dialogue absent, so voice distinctiveness rests on weighted metaphor and sentence music, which holds.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s precision-oriented perceptual filter: star-maps on brass, faint rake-etchings, “increment of duty.” Diction (“searing reverie,” “ethical diligent”) is slightly elevated yet consistent with his reverent temperament; rhythm lengthens and contracts to echo pendulum swing. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. No filter-verb clutter; immediacy sustained. Psychic distance stable; unreliability not attempted. Slight risk: occasional loftiness (“metaphor for the town’s fragile equilibrium”) edges toward thesis, but interior context earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hushed, elegiac rhythm; diction stays within gardener-perception (“threads…like the lives of those buried”). No dialogue to test, and no head-hopping; filter-verb clusters are minimal, but syntactic parallelism (“a…a…a…”) softens peak pressure, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Ignorance’s perceptual filter—iridescent blues, cartographic metaphors, silence of the lake. Syntax lengthens during the writing fugue then contracts at the end, mirroring energy surge. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A; narrative diction remains consistent, slightly elevated but justified by the fairy-tale register.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature tilts toward sound and parchment texture, apt for a copyist. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “glow” and “mist” to create cadence. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within Clara’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulates slightly under peak reception—shorter clauses mimic breath-catching—then re-settles.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“powder the air,” “silent benediction”) carries lyrical texture without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for reverence, fragments for ash motes—maintaining control under pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited adheres to Kael; perceptual signature favors mechanical metaphors (“pressure valves of thought,” “cog-precision of anger”). Syntax tightens under stress—sentence fragments when collapse news hits. Dialogue voices diverge: Kael’s formal diction versus Lira’s clipped scavenger idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses credibly at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical, music-inflected diction suits choir-teacher POV; sentence rhythm modulates from languid description to breath-matched hum phrases. No head-hop; psychic distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bias—she “tastes” wind and starlight, reads scars as warrior markings. Syntax modulates: longer, soil-heavy sentences in calm, clipped fragments under dawn pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Free-indirect “she knew planting here was risky” keeps psychic distance tight. Diction never drifts above her culinary-earth lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: shifting box patterns, cold air, hum. Diction is controlled, slightly elevated (“etched,” “lacquer,” “sentinel”) but consistent with a toll keeper who names machinery. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived. One micro-template: “the box was...” repeated sentence stem early, but it’s isolated and doesn’t blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“creeping normality noticer,” “shard of hush”) creates a distinctive lyrical cadence that matches the hushed-blaze tone. No head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated phrasing (“time seemed to pause”) edges toward template lyricism but remains consistent with the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    Narrative stance remains stable third-person telepathic, filtered through Liora’s perceptual bias—time as tapestry of whispers. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic variation supports the hush of underwater stillness. No dialogue; therefore dialogue bullets waived. Free indirect thought clean: “its mind was a tapestry…” reads as Liora’s self-concept, not narrator intrusion. Diction stays within poetics of stillness and silence; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate sustains a mathematician’s cadence—measured syntax, equation metaphors—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for theorem-thought, staccato fragments when die slips. “Grim optimist” diction colours every perception; no corporate register drift. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated (“she watched as they landed”). Closure syntax mirrors acceptance: open cadence, no terminal epiphany line.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “waxing moon … danced across her canvas.” Rhythm modulates—long humid clauses vs. short breathless strokes under vision.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited stays close to Elara’s artifact-minded perception; diction (“emerald-tinted opera glass lens,” “rosewater dread”) is vivid yet consistent with her curatorial eye. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. Syntax lengthens during kneading, then shortens at the communal laugh, mirroring pulse. Dialogue is absent, but interior monologue carries subtext and goal pursuit cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited voice maintains salt-etched, gear-oil diction; perceptual signature is consistent—“counter-clockwise clock maker” is a lovely, idiosyncratic self-definition. Rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to staccato final sentences that mirror the ticking reversal. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; free-indirect stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Leeward’s sea-tuned perception; diction is salted, rhythmic, syntactically varied. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Compressed elisions (“sketched resonance”) are taught by context and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Close-third POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is cartographic—she notices cracks, angles, symbols—giving the prose a distinct filter. Syntax is controlled, no template cadence; metaphor is sparse and grounded (“eyes like polished obsidian”). Reed-whistle notes are rendered as action, not exposition. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A; narrative diction stays within her plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a measured, scholarly cadence apt for a historian. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices “faded sign,” “cryptic notes”—but syntax never flexes under pressure; the archive revelation keeps the same cool register. No dialogue appears, so voice remains monolithic, not tested. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter—professional distance (“stone arches half-buried in silt”) slips into synesthetic awe (“hushed blaze of anticipation”)—maintaining coherent psychic distance. Syntax is controlled, with sentence variety that accelerates across the wade then slows for the mortar seal, mirroring bodily tempo. One minor register slip: “interlaced absence was the core concept here” momentarily lectures; still, the phrase is the sole meta intrusion in an otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—cataloguer’s taxonomic eye (“weathered tomes,” “faint traces of ink”). Rhythm modulates: long sentences for submersion, fragment bursts at wall-shift. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Filter verbs appear but feel like curator caution; no head-hop or register drift. Final image of glowing stamp in hand is a Charged Poise worthy of 9+ territory, but earlier decorative adjectives (“reclaimed stillness”) dull the blade.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close adheres to Kael’s perceptual filter; “calloused from years of gem polishing” grounds occupational idiom. Syntax flexes with pressure (“hands stilled…sank to his knees”). No head-hopping; Lira’s voice remains external. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext. Final line cadence mirrors release with soft consonants—“honor it”—satisfying ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person close POV stays stable; perceptual signature relies on repeated “as if” constructions and abstract noun stacks that edge toward template cadence. Diction remains within plausible range for a reflective survivor. Rhythm breathes appropriately across paragraphs; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice is competent but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Kael’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax is serviceable, occasionally rhythmic (“brilliant dimness” refrain). Diction stays within pilot lexicon except for one lapse—“perceptual signature” not shown. Voice lacks idiosyncratic texture; could swap names without change. No dialogue to test subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—cobalt glare, sieved hush, metal bite; rhythmic compression (“He clenched it tighter…”) mirrors rising nausea without head-hopping; diction remains within his dusky, guilt-tinged lexicon, and no dialogue is required.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature filters every detail through negotiation bias—moon as calendar, brass as wisdom talisman. Syntax is elevated but consistent with her ceremonial mindset; no register drift. Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual: Kael’s “neutrality is a luxury” carries entire geopolitics. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is calm, coastal, slightly lyrical—“waves lapped merrily against the shore” marries melancholy to rhythm. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices spacing, wear, salt, not tourist vistas. No dialogue, so no contamination. Filter verbs (“she felt”) intrude but are sparse; compression is taught early and maintained. Final image modulates tone successfully, meeting the 9- gate but lacking the syntactic daring or idiosyncrasy required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “reflection distorted,” “whisper answers he couldn’t yet hear.” Diction is restrained, slightly weary—matching jaded affect—yet lifts into lyric register only when describing light, never self-analysis. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for cavern awe, clipped fragments underwater; pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-limited lyrical voice sustains consistent fairytale register (“trees heavy with fruit that shimmered like captured stars”). Diction stays within poetic-omniscient lexicon, but syntax occasionally drifts into self-help cadence (“gift she had rarely used since her bond was broken”). Guardian dialogue is thunder-wind cliché; differentiation relies on grandeur rather than worldview. Perceptual signature is generic wonder—no idiosyncratic filter tied to Elara’s beast-whisperer vocation; she notices what any enchanted wanderer would.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person close stays stable; perceptual signature leans poetic—filament phrases like “shimmered with the weight of forgotten dreams” establish texture. Syntax is rhythmically varied, but occasional elevated diction (“choking beauty,” “kaleidoscope of what could have been”) edges toward literary template; not quite ventriloqued through Elara’s idiom. Free indirect thought is clean; no head-hopping. Voice modulation under pressure is present but mild—no compressed diction or syntactic fragmentation when the saucer ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature anchored in tool-belt weight and photo-shimmer memory. Syntax varies: long lyrical cadence for void, shorter clauses at portal threshold. No dialogue to test; interior diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. One micro drift: “otherworldly resonance” edges abstract, but pattern holds. Voice is coherent, not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction favors tactility ("cool grains," "veil of smoke") without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments at star-align climax. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. Patterned repetition of "whispering hush" is taught early and paid off, satisfying 9+ quick test for rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited hovers close to Elara; perceptual signature is observant, tactile, metrically calm—“her fingers brushed,” “angles shifted under her touch.” No head-hopping; Thorne’s interior is withheld. Diction stays within a guard’s lexicon; only “conceptually carved key” edges ornate but occurs in low-pressure exposition. Rhythm breathes with the beats; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight in Kael’s diction—verbs like “slippery charges,” “jagged edges kissed”—auroral colors filtered through his herder-eye. No head-hopping; perceptual signature selects matte rocks against shimmering water, foregrounding matte/mathematics tension. Rhythm accelerates into short paratactic clauses during dust scatter, mirroring pulse without syntactic monotony. Minor “borrowed dawn” echo flirts with poetic template but is earned by auroral setup.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature favors meteorological and anatomical metaphor (“storm-kissed wonder,” “skin of the world”). Syntax grows more fragmented as tension peaks, mirroring cognitive rarefaction. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Register stays poetic but anchored to observatory tools, avoiding purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature leans on mechanical whirs and light shards, giving rhythmic specificity. Occasional elevated diction (“dignified chaos,” “conceptual repricing”) drifts above character lexicon, but cadence remains controlled. No head-hopping; voice coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent poetic register—“map of scars,” “forgotten hymn”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature is biased toward the visual and tactile, apt for a poet who paints. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Clara’s diction is plainer, creating clean contrast when she speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction stays pianistic—“gnarled,” “weathered,” “bleeding fingers”—without purple drift. Rhythm swells and subsides with scene tempo; no scaffold loops. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. One filter-verb cluster (“she often wondered”) is minor; no 9-bar because no peak-stress syntactic compression is attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person lyrical mode stays stable; diction aspires to mythic cadence but drifts into elevated generics (“sanctuary of collective memory,” “luminous doubt”). Filter verbs are few, yet sentence rhythm defaults to rolling periodic clauses that mute urgency under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is avoided; however, the creature’s choral whisper and Elara’s inner register sound indistinguishable from the narrator, flattening vocal contrast. Perceptual signature is present in the ridge/bloom personification but not in Elara’s cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices patterns, decay rates, and light refraction through a scientist’s lens tinged with poetic sensitivity. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, lyrical sentences during observation; tighter phrasing during discovery. Voice avoids therapy-speak and remains grounded in concrete perception. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are moot; prose rhythm supports the accumulative design without head-hopping or distance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a lyrical yet precise voice matching Elara’s artisan sensibility (“shadows danced and silence hummed”). Syntax varies rhythmically, compressing during action (“She knelt… tracing… piecing”) and expanding in reflection. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. Voice remains consistent under stress, though elevated diction (“drifting resonance,” “scorched testament”) occasionally veers toward ornamental abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled, filtering all description through Elara’s musician-turned-translator sensibility. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; sharper fragments during tension (“Her hands trembled”). Dialogue is minimal but distinct—Kael’s signing contrasts Elara’s internal flow without convergence. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains perceptual specificity (“veins visible through translucent material”), though one late abstraction (“unshaken marvels”) slightly drifts from embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s perceptual signature—his undertaker’s attention to texture, decay, and quiet urgency shapes every observation. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences in reflective beats, tighter phrasing during search sequences. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon (“choked with seaweed,” “fractured prisms”), avoiding academic intrusions. No head-hopping; prose reflects his weary yet purposeful interiority without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a lyrical yet controlled voice that modulates rhythm to match emotional beats—shorter sentences during tension (“Mara froze”), flowing cadence in reflection. Perceptual signature is strong: Mara notices cracked tiles, embers, doorsteps—details tied to her caretaking role. Dialogue is sparse but natural; the widow’s line carries age and suspicion without exposition. No head-hopping or register drift; prose remains within plausible focalizer lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually specific: Elara notices shimmering wisteria, cool iron, rhythmic sparks. Syntax modulates with emotion—longer sentences in wonder, shorter during revelation. Voice avoids therapy-speak; diction (“skeletal ribcage,” “foggy lucidity”) reflects her artistic, spiritually attuned mind. No head-hopping; prose remains tightly focalized without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns, textures, temporal echoes. Voice modulates under pressure: prose tightens during maze navigation (“footsteps echoed softly”), then swells lyrically in the vortex. Diction remains within her designer lexicon (“hyperbolic geometry,” “retrocognitive entrapment”) without register drift. Only minor flaw: the phrase “quaking reverie” edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in physical action (“gave way to sharp focus”).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through the liberator’s urgent perception (“steps were deliberate,” “breath steady”). Voice has distinct texture: lyrical but taut, with rhythmic control (chains “clinking like a macabre rhythm”). Syntax varies effectively under pressure, shortening during the chase. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but perceptual signature is consistent—focus on symbols, paths, and tactile details (yellowed keys, rotted floorboards)—without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices colors as sounds, textures as memories. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; shorter, visceral phrasing at the forge climax. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (no register drift), and syntax mirrors her synesthetic cognition. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in her body and tool belt, with compression used purposefully in reflective blocks that alter present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a lyrical but controlled voice that modulates rhythm under pressure (e.g., short clauses during the chime). Diction blends poetic precision (“luminous disbelief”) with character-specific perception. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Elara’s “I’ve been waiting for someone who could read the flowers” carries subtext of loneliness. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices textures (frayed leather, molten glass) and narrates tasks with ritualistic cadence. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though diction occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism (“fire’s kiss,” “weighty lightness”) that slightly exceeds plausible self-narration. No head-hopping; free indirect thought is clean. The dramatic narration device is introduced but underutilized beyond one instance, limiting its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable and filtered through Elara’s sensory anxiety (“trembling certainty,” “breath catching”). Voice modulates rhythmically—shorter sentences under stress—but occasionally slips into elevated diction (“timeless embrace,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls, but interiority sometimes leans on label-speak (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive”).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyrically precise, with a perceptual signature fixated on texture (“flaking gold leaf,” “crackling like dried leaves”) and charged silence. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer cadences for stories, fragmented awe at climax. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with psychic distance calibrated to ritual intensity. Diction stays within oracle’s lexicon; no register drift or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Unit-7’s precise, mechanical yet yearning sensibility (“metallic fingers gently cradling”). Voice modulates with pressure: short, clean sentences during action; lyrical flow during transcendence. Syntax mirrors cognition—structured yet evolving. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually specific—Elara notices damp edges, refracted light, resonant hush. Voice modulates with emotional intensity: prose tightens during decision (“With a deep breath, Elara decided to act”) and softens in resolution. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Kian’s “It’s beautiful” carries subtext and breaks stasis. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or register drift. The lyric compression feels taught and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and horticultural precision. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in reflection, shorter strokes during polishing—mirroring Elias’s focus. Diction stays within his pragmatic lexicon; no register drift. Minor flaw: slight overuse of filter verbs (“he felt,” “he realized”) in the climax dulls immediacy, but not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s technical perception (“holographic principles,” “magnetic nexus”). Voice modulates effectively: lyrical during observation (“metallic scar,” “beating wings at rest”), clipped and urgent during crisis (“alarms blared,” “hands flying”). Syntax varies purposefully, with shorter sentences under pressure. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls, and perceptual signature is distinct—she notices systems, light patterns, mechanical states first. A minor flaw: occasional elevated diction (“subdued awakenings,” “resonant reconfiguration”) feels slightly outside a mechanic’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Clara’s perceptual signature—musician’s attention to gaps, pauses, unstruck chords. Voice modulates with intensity: prose tightens during discovery (“fingers brushing silt”), expands in epiphany (“haunting beauty that seemed to heal”). No dialogue, so voice distinction irrelevant. Rhythmic control is strong, using sentence variation to mirror rising tension. However, slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction (“wordless conversation,” “in between spaces”) edges toward label-speak without always grounding in action, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled, with a perceptual signature that blends botanical precision (“veins of the leaves”) and metaphysical unease (“swaying certainties”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, fluid sentences during reflection; clipped phrases during disruption (“She reached out”). Voice remains consistent even in stress, avoiding therapy-speak or diagnostic labels. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing near climax, though not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person-limited POV is stable, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, sound, and doubt (“skeptical nature,” “flickered,” “drowsy alertness”). Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during the scream sequence—but avoids melodrama. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are void. The prose maintains consistent psychic distance, though interiority occasionally slips into summary (“something had shifted within her”) rather than embodied thought. Overall, voice serves atmosphere and theme without intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices textures (vines, folds, obsidian) and sounds (river’s murmur, heartbeat) filtered through her archival mindset. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter ones during tension (“She gripped the swan tighter”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Minor deduction: slight register drift in “cryptic folds” and “regenerative silence,” but consistent within character.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara’s lyrical perception (“steps were deliberate, as if each one were a note”). Voice modulates effectively—spare during tension (“It’s like the sky is broken”), lush during revelation (curl mirroring corona). Dialogue distinguishes ages: Finn’s trembling simplicity vs. Elara’s measured cadence. Minor flaw: final paragraph’s “promise of wonder yet to come” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the perceptual signature established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures, whispers, and residues of time. Syntax varies purposefully, slowing for reflection, tightening during ritual. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“bronze quiet,” “displaced axis of humanity’s existence”) that borders on label-speak, but remains consistent in tone. POV is stable, immersive, and modulates with emotional intensity—strong control for a single-POV piece.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice is consistent but leans into ornate abstraction (“transpose life into a new key,” “familiar enigma”) that distances rather than embodies. Syntax is rhythmic but monotonous in high-pressure beats, favoring lyrical repetition over perceptual specificity. POV remains stable, yet narration over-explains interior states (“renewed purpose,” “latent power”) instead of trusting implication.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and tightly controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to silence, void, and resonance. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during possession’s approach, looping cadences during inquiry. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“unraveled stillness,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that slightly exceeds plausible focalizer lexicon, but pattern is taught and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly controlled, with a perceptual signature fixated on reflection, spirals, and thresholds. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for memory; shorter, urgent phrases near climax. POV remains stable and immersive, with no head-hopping or leakage. The prose embodies the protagonist’s “upturned hush” through rhythm and diction (“hushed stillness,” “trembling thread”), and elision (no dialogue, minimal backstory) serves the accumulative design. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or thematic texture without scaffold or drift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled in third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and gravity-defying sensation (“boots gripping the slick surface,” “runes glowed faintly”). Syntax varies purposefully—shorter sentences during fractal shifts, lyrical flow in reflective beats—without head-hopping or register drift. The voice remains consistent under pressure, though the phrase “procedural generation” momentarily jars as unmotivated jargon. Closure image (“the ripple was hers to shape”) recharges the opening rain motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled, filtered through Elara’s tactile perception—“vibrations told stories,” “melodies danced in memory.” Voice modulates rhythmically: short, percussive sentences during work; lyrical flow in epiphany. Syntax mirrors drumming cadence. No head-hopping; prose embodies her sensory world without over-explaining. Distinct perceptual signature sustains pressure without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable, third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s meticulous perception (“fingers brushed,” “mind trained to intuit patterns”). Voice carries a restrained lyricism suited to a recorder of storms. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the masked figure’s lines avoid exposition. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “nurture integrity in solitude,” which leans abstract, but overall diction remains character-bound and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with diction (“wistful,” “fragile threads”) mirroring Elias’s restrained sorrow. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for memory immersion, shorter for present tension. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing scents, light, textures). Dialogue is sparse but distinct (the woman’s “thick with sorrow” voice).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elias’s poetic sensibility (“sky pulsed,” “rhythm he’d seen before”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical density in contemplation (“frayed coil... like a forgotten promise”) sharpens to stark clarity at climax (“impossible choice—to be bound, to drift, or to uncover”). Syntax mirrors thematic rhythm—long, flowing sentences fracture during mirror visions, then resolve into steady cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive, and filtered through Elara’s acoustic sensitivity—her perception narrows to hums, creaks, glints. Voice modulates from hesitant to swelling cadence during performance, mirroring emotional arc. Syntax varies purposefully; no head-hopping or register drift. One slip: “the land itself mourned the loss of its voice” edges toward personification that slightly exceeds strict POV bounds, but remains within lyrical tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices mineral scents and static shifts before emotional cues, reflecting her occupation. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences during ritual focus, clipped phrases at transformation climax (“The static electricity crackled”). Free indirect style cleanly merges her expertise (“counterfeit emotion dealer”) with sensory precision. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored even in reflective beats about Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara’s shrewd yet tender sensibility. Voice modulates effectively—from lyrical (“final note hung like a promise”) to pragmatic (“cargo broker who noticed the overlooked”). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Clara’s lines carry age-appropriate cadence. No head-hopping, and perceptual bias is consistent (notices envelopes, locket, stars). However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“silent contributors whose kindness went unnoticed”) that slightly exceeds Elara’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered tightly through Lira’s perceptual signature—she notices light, texture, and absence with a sculptor’s eye. Voice modulates with emotional intensity: lyrical during reflection (“luminescent ache”), precise during action (“fingers moved with precision”). Syntax varies purposefully, avoiding monotony. No dialogue dilutes focus, and the prose remains within Lira’s plausible lexicon—no register drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices rhythms, glints, textures befitting a natural history illustrator. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, fluid sentences during contemplation; tighter phrasing during action (“She stepped onto the narrow canal ledge”). Voice remains consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift. The prose trusts dramatization over explanation, though one or two phrases (“sculpt time itself”) flirt with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable and apt, filtered through Elara’s inventive, analytical mind (“gently inventive ideas,” “dovetailed into a theory”). Voice modulates with intensity: clipped during discovery (“Without hesitation, she pocketed the eyes”), lyrical at closure (“orchard seemed to glow brighter”). Syntax varies purposefully; diction stays within conjurer lexicon (“chipped patterns,” “resonant reconfiguration” avoided). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct—she notices mathematical patterns in shadows and mosaics.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“sapphire hush,” “metallic veins humming”). POV remains stable third-limited, filtered through the dweller’s methodical perception. Syntax varies purposefully—short clauses during discovery, flowing sentences in reflection. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing texture, sound, temperature). Elevated diction (“ferromagnetic,” “reconfiguration”) fits character’s thoughtful nature without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical, botanical, introspective—with rhythmic control that breathes with the storm’s cadence. POV remains tightly focalized; perception narrows appropriately under stress (e.g., leaf’s warmth, moss scent). But occasional register drift occurs: “sustaining transformation,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing veers toward academic abstraction in peak moments. No dialogue, so voice relies entirely on interior texture, which mostly holds.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elara’s insomniac, artist-perceptive lens (“canvas of unending restlessness,” “haggard awe”). Voice modulates rhythmically—from lyrical description during rain to terse focus in the ruin—without register drift. The old woman’s dialogue (“You’ve found it”) carries mythic brevity, distinct from Elara’s interiority. No head-hopping; even shared traits (“wryly earnest”) feel character-specific, not authorial echo.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s sensory and emotional state. Voice has distinct lyric rhythm (“shadows cast by unseen forces,” “chorus of possibility”) that modulates with intensity. Prose avoids filter verbs and maintains perceptual consistency—she notices sound, light, texture aligned with her clairvoyant sensitivity. Minor register drift in climax (“catalyst for change,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) slightly elevates diction beyond character, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtering all description through Elara’s sensory and professional bias (“symbols she recognized from ancient maps”). Voice modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; shorter, rhythmic phrases during discovery (“Her steps were deliberate, each one a heartbeat”). No head-hopping; the stranger’s dialogue carries distinct idiom (“navigate absences”) without convergence. Prose as character—archival precision meets poetic intuition—feels singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and calibrated to Elara’s perceptive precision (“whispering forests,” “shimmered like starlight”). Syntax varies purposefully, tightening during tension (“Her heart raced...”). No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in her sensory and intellectual experience. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction (“uncanny ability,” “surreal beauty”), but never breaks voice or clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices mathematical order, celestial rhythms, and quiet voids. Prose modulates with emotional intensity—spare during discovery, lush at climax. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register (“unheard symphony,” “sculpt space for reflection”) that borders on diagnostic, slightly distancing the reader in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elyr notices light, magnetism, and dimensional ripples, reflecting his immortal, physics-aware POV.

The prose embodies Elyr’s mind without over-explaining, trusting imagery to carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single POV is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices cracks, seals, ripples—details reflecting her need for integrity. Syntax modulates under stress (shorter sentences during footsteps). Dialogue is sparse but sharp; father’s “Sense is overrated” contrasts Clara’s literal truth-telling. No head-hopping, and free indirect style blends seamlessly. Minor register drift in “mathematics of a fair trade” feels character-apt, not academic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct: precise, lyrical, yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature (noticing frequencies, textures, light). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences in reflection, tighter phrasing during the hum’s climax. POV is stable, with no leakage. The prose embodies “incandescent restraint,” especially in the closing descent, where emotion is implied through action and environment, never stated.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (“filtered reality differently”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, shorter during discovery—and diction remains consistent (lyrical but grounded). No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested. The prose embodies the wanderer’s synesthetic perception without head-hopping or register drift, sustaining lyric compression while teaching its pattern early (“whispers of the past layered with sounds of the present”).

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person POV is stable and perceptually specific—Mara notices wood grain, salt air, and resonant frequencies through her myth-buster lens.

No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. The prose embodies her synesthetic perception (“voice of the universe,” “hues of a sunset trapped in glass”) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Lira’s orderly perception (“intuitive mind,” pattern recognition). Voice has rhythmic control, modulating from lyrical description to urgent resolve. Dialogue is minimal but distinct (Vorin’s condescension vs. Lira’s silence). No head-hopping, though interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“hopeful desperation”). Prose reflects Lira’s mindset without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable, first-person-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices decay, silence, and mentor-linked objects. Prose modulates rhythm under pressure: shorter sentences during discovery (“Her heart quickened”), lyrical flow in reflection. No dialogue avoids voice pitfalls. Register stays consistent, though “dawning hush” and “dawnlit melancholy” verge on poetic abstraction. Voice feels individual, not committee-written.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s non-visual senses. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences during reflection, tighter beats during repair—with diction grounded in artisanal lexicon (“contours,” “frayed wires,” “magnetic calm”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct (light as sound, mist as presence). Prose avoids filter verbs, favoring embodied immediacy. Minor register drift in “soul woven into every piece” edges toward abstraction but doesn’t break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s precise, map-trained perception (“veins of a map,” “pattern of condensation”). Voice modulates subtly—dry exposition early (“worrying tranquility”) gives way to lyrical compression at climax (“clear and cold… unseen but inevitable”). Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses for action (“She knelt”), flowing sentences for reflection. No head-hopping; falcon’s presence is observed, not interiorized.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)

POV remains tightly focalized through Elias, with perceptual bias toward vibration and resonance. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Prose modulates subtly with emotional intensity—longer sentences during reflection, tighter beats during ritual—showing masterful rhythmic control that serves the Accumulative lens without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable first-person limited, with prose modulating toward poetic density under pressure. Voice shows perceptual bias—Maya notices carvings, not marine biology—but slips into ornate abstraction (“lonesome splendor,” “ephemeral”) that exceeds a scientist’s lexicon. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, though template cadence appears in climax (“As she worked… As Maya reached…”). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls, but register drift weakens authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices scuffs, copperlight, lattice patterns—details filtered through obsession and inheritance. Voice modulates effectively: lyrical in description (“copperlight repose”), taut in action (“creaked as he pushed”). No dialogue, so mechanics aren’t tested. Prose rhythm varies naturally, though a few elevated phrases (“labyrinth of stories”) flirt with register drift. Free indirect thought is clean, and psychic distance remains intimate without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lush yet precise, with a perceptual signature steeped in alchemical melancholy (“ashen-veil,” “resonant awakenings”). Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for memory; tighter phrasing during the bead’s activation. POV remains steadfastly single and immersive, with no leakage or head-hopping. The prose earns its lyricism through consistent diction and rhythmic control, especially in the climactic shimmer where sentence cadence mirrors spectral dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical, rhythmic, steeped in textile and cartographic metaphors (“stitch,” “path,” “weaver”). POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s poetic sensibility, with perceptual consistency (noticing murals, scents, plate shifts). Syntax varies effectively, compressing during movement, expanding in reflection. No head-hopping or register drift; prose embodies her craft. Slight overuse of elevated diction (“brimming with life and possibility”) risks distancing, but pattern is taught and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, first-person-limited in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature (“tree roots snaked between ancient bones like veins”). Voice modulates rhythmically—from lyrical opening to urgent discovery—without head-hopping. Diction stays within Elara’s lexicon (“warmly curious,” “cautious enchantment”), avoiding register drift. Free indirect thought is clean, and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the tomb reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lyra notices patterns, textures, and historical echoes. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction remains consistent within her pseudonym-creator lexicon. No head-hopping; POV is stable. The prose modulates well under pressure (e.g., shorter clauses during mailbox approach). Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on elegant abstraction (“futuristic nostalgia”) over grittier immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV is tightly controlled; every observation filtered through Elara’s embroiderer sensibility (“constellations shimmered with urgency”). Voice modulates rhythm—longer sentences for contemplation, clipped phrases during threat (“Who are you?”). Dialogue carries subtext: Lira’s “I’ve come to synchronize” implies shared history without exposition. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays rooted in tactile, cosmic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable, immersive, and perceptually specific—Lira notices color, texture, light like an artist. Voice modulates with intensity: lyrical in description, urgent in action. Syntax varies purposefully; rhythm mirrors fog’s ebb and flow. No head-hopping or register drift. Minor flaw: one over-compressed clause (“time felt fluid within the fold of a daydream”) risks abstraction but is anchored by context.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elara’s restorer sensibility (“methodically playful,” noticing faded lines). Voice modulates with intensity: fluid syntax during work, fragmented awe at awakening (“breath catching”). Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—no academic intrusions. The whisper “carried through reflected sound” exemplifies perceptual signature. No head-hopping; even animated figures speak through her auditory lens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature (“edges blurred by fear,” “shadows shifted unnaturally”). Voice modulates under pressure: prose tightens during threat (“Elias froze”), then eases into lyrical resolve at closure. Dialogue distinguishes characters—Elias’s wit vs. Krane’s gravity—and carries subtext (testing loyalty). No head-hopping; diction stays within Elias’s scholar-rogue lexicon. Near-flawless control.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyrical, introspective, rhythmically varied, with a perceptual signature attuned to echo, light, and texture. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, flowing sentences during composition; shorter, warmer phrases at climax. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with controlled psychic distance. The prose embodies the poet’s mind: “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” exemplifies voice-as-character. Minor register drift occurs in “photosynthesize pain into beauty,” but it’s character-consistent as poetic self-mythology.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, sound, and fragility (“crystalline tears,” “shards of moonlight”).

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is masterfully controlled: every observation filtered through Elara’s astrological sensibility (“constellations,” “dialect spoken in light”). Syntax modulates with emotion—longer sentences during wonder, fragments during alarm. Voice remains distinct under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. The only slip: “softly ingenious” appears twice as a label without contextual variation, momentarily flattening diction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a perceptual signature tuned to texture and light (“swirling patterns that resembled forgotten constellations”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in reflection, shorter during frustration—and diction stays within Lira’s lyrical lexicon.

Minor register drift in “transliterates emotions” feels occupational, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, observational, with lyrical compression (“calculated wilderness”). POV remains tightly focalized through Elias; no head-hopping. Diction modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during the act, flowing cadence in reflection.

    POV is stable, deeply interior, and voice-distinct: Elias’s firefighter precision inflects syntax (“calloused yet precise,” “jagged where it had split”). Prose modulates rhythm with emotional intensity—longer sentences during reflection, shorter during revelation. No dialogue, so voice relies on perceptual signature: noticing cracks, weight, light. Minor register drift in “enlighten himself” (slightly academic), but overall diction remains grounded in his lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices logic in beauty, time in erosion. Syntax modulates with rhythm—longer sentences during reflection, tighter phrasing during action. Voice remains consistent even in lyric passages. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; prose-as-character succeeds through rhythmic control and selective attention.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with strong perceptual signature (noticing ink stains, celestial patterns). Voice modulates effectively—measured during negotiation, raw at climax—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register (“slow dance of celestial bodies”) that slightly distances immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, lyrical, yet precise, with syntax modulating from flowing description to staccato tension (“This was it”). Perceptual signature is strong—Elara notices cracks as maps, salt as mirror—filtering world through her guilt and hope. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interiority, which avoids diagnostic labels. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in “fractured grace” and “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing near climax, bordering on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices light, texture, and vibration before emotion, reflecting her courtesan’s trained observation. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences during reflection give way to tighter phrasing at the climax (“The door slid open with a whisper”). No head-hopping; single POV is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical cadence, fitting the mystic-astronomer premise. Diction blends empirical (“schematic representations”) and poetic (“dusky harmony”) registers, though occasionally veers into diagnostic label-speak (“empirically ironic nature”). No dialogue to test voice distinction. Prose modulates rhythm well, but perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—Kael notices what the plot requires, not what his profession or frugality would prioritize.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV stays consistent, but voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Elara’s narration blends therapeutic jargon (“cellular memory,” “layers of anger”) with lyrical abstraction. Dialogue distinguishes characters slightly (Kael’s terseness vs. Elara’s calm), but both speak in perfectly grammatical, articulate sentences under stress. Prose rhythm remains steady without modulation for emotional peaks; the “soundless” premise isn’t reflected in syntactic experimentation (e.g., fragmented sentences to embody silence).

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-POV is stable and richly filtered: Elara notices starlight “like a celestial tapestry” and cicada carvings “as if reading a story,” reflecting her chronicler identity. Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for contemplation, tighter phrasing during revelation (“The jade cicada grew warm”). Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift. The perceptual signature is distinct: she absorbs narratives “without judgment,” embodying warmth through observation rather than action.

    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices shimmer in fabric, warmth in glass, patterns in light. Voice modulates subtly—lyrical during revelation, grounded during chores—without register drift. Syntax varies purposefully, though a few high-pressure beats lean slightly abstract (“surrendering its brilliance to nourish something greater”). No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Lira’s sensory and emotional field.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias’s tranquilly perceptive POV. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer, flowing sentences in reflection; tighter phrasing during discovery). No head-hopping, filter-verb overuse, or register drift. The prose embodies his attentiveness (“light filtered through broken glass,” “flickers of light that danced in the corners of his vision”), creating a cohesive perceptual signature that sustains pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered tightly through Elara’s perception with a lyrical yet precise diction (“numbers flickered erratically, as if time itself had grown uncertain”). Voice modulates effectively—calm description gives way to charged brevity during the climax (“With trembling hands, Elara activated the device”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Thaddeus’s “voice thick with emotion” contrasts Elara’s steadiness, reinforcing status and history. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through the poet’s perceptual signature—she notices iridescence, dampness, fragmentation. Prose rhythm modulates: languid during stillness, precise during repair. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—the wanderer’s speech carries labor-worn simplicity versus her lyrical interiority. Voice converges intentionally at closure, reflecting harmony. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent. Elevated diction (“burnished hush,” “discord harmonized”) fits her poetic worldview without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and imbued with Elias’s perceptual signature: botanical precision, reverence for pattern, quiet resolve. Syntax modulates subtly—longer sentences for reflection, tighter phrasing during action. Voice remains consistent under pressure, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. No dialogue, so speech distinctness isn’t tested, but interiority stays character-bound and free of head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical but precise, favoring concrete nouns (“fly amber,” “moss-covered ledge”) and restrained metaphor. Syntax varies effectively—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for ascent beats. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with consistent psychic distance. Minor register drift in “luminous skeptic” and “artificial pilgrimage” edges toward label-speak, but remains within plausible academic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, steeped in elegiac cadence that mirrors the coachman’s ritual. POV is stable third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in selective noticing (bird calls as maps, seed pods as vessels). Syntax modulates—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action—without monotony. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. The prose embodies the theme, though near the end, phrases like “fertilizing the soul” flirt with abstraction without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s sensory and emotional history. Voice modulates subtly—from weary detachment to stirred curiosity—with syntax tightening during the phonograph sequence. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Lira’s breathless urgency contrasts Elias’s gravelly restraint. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (nose-first noticing, tactile memory) remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—filtered through Elara’s perceptive, poetic sensibility. Syntax varies purposefully: longer, flowing sentences for cosmic wonder; shorter phrases for resolve. No head-hopping (single POV), and perceptual signature is strong (noticing temporal bends in starlight, humming metal). Register remains within plausible lexicon for a contemplative observer. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on elevated diction (“fleeting grasp of eternity,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) in peak beats, though not jarring enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices patterns, carvings, light—traits of a former apprentice of wonder. Syntax modulates with pressure (fluid during ascent, taut during chess). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. Prose stays within plausible lexicon—elevated but not academic. Free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“his heart a mix of cautious abandon”). The only slip: “sacredly playful nature” reads as label-speak, though quickly grounded in action. Overall, voice embodies the theme without intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias (noticing absences, echoes, grooves). Voice modulates subtly—from reflective to liberated—with rhythmic control during the walking sequence. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Kael’s aphoristic weight contrasts Elara’s searching tone. No head-hopping or register drift, though the prose occasionally leans into lyrical abstraction (“nomadic penumbra”) that momentarily distances embodiment. Overall, voice serves theme without overwhelming immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s fluidity (“movements mirroring the shifting light”). POV remains tightly focalized; all description filters through her sensorium. Syntax varies purposefully, compressing during tension (“The storm within her broke…”). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls, and perceptual signature (noticing light, texture, whispers) remains consistent. Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing slightly mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, deeply interior, with a perceptual signature fixated on textures, patterns, and echoes. Prose rhythm modulates: short sentences during tension (“She knew what she had to do”), flowing cadence in reflection. Voice avoids therapy-speak except at climax. No dialogue, so policy doesn’t apply; free indirect thought is seamless. Minor flaw: “fierce repose” recurs mechanically, slightly flattening voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Lira’s artistic, rebellious sensibility. Voice modulates effectively—from hushed awe to desperate urgency—with rhythmic control in the poetry sequences. Syntax compresses during tension (“She pressed on…”), then expands at revelation. No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon, though the elevated metaphors occasionally edge toward register drift. The perceptual signature (noticing refraction, echoes, shards) remains consistent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices patterns (pockmarks ≈ charm), textures (oil, rust), and mechanical rhythms. Voice modulates effectively—shorter sentences during crisis, lyrical flow in reflection. No dialogue simplifies execution, but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction (“quilts memories together,” “conjures meaning”) that slightly exceeds plausible alchemical lexicon, though not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara’s artistic sensibility (“fleeting dance of light,” “hues of blue and gold”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; shorter, active ones during painting. Voice is distinct and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift. The absence of dialogue avoids pitfalls, and free indirect thought blends seamlessly. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual description at the expense of other senses in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Elias’s perceptual signature (noticing stone echoes, scent gradients). Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences in reflection, clipped urgency during descent. Diction stays within keeper’s lexicon—no register drift. The woman’s single line carries subtext and avoids exposition. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and mechanical decay. Voice modulates subtly—spare during labor, lyrical at climax—without register drift. Syntax varies purposefully; short clauses heighten tension during building, longer sentences evoke contemplation. The lone dialogue exchange (“I followed the signal”) feels natural and weighted. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Mara’s knowledge and sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices soil, roots, light angles—truffle forager’s precision. Voice modulates under stress (blunt speech when truthful, rhythmic prose during ritual). No head-hopping; Mara’s dialogue is brief but distinct (trembling reverence). Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction in the Latin phrase and epiphany, though justified by ritual context.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single POV is controlled and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices absences, textures, and imprints others might miss. Prose rhythm modulates with tension: short sentences during discovery (“He knelt.”), lyrical flow in reflection. Voice remains consistent, avoiding therapy-speak or omniscience. Minor flaw: the phrase “softly persistent habits” slightly labels rather than embodies, but the trait is later shown in his methodical steps and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Elias’s sensory precision (“creases and stains,” “glimmer faintly”). Voice modulates subtly—from melancholic stillness to awed discovery—with rhythmic variation in sentence length. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (notices patterns, textures, light). Prose occasionally edges toward ornate (“whispered tales of forgotten eras”) but stays within plausible lexicon for an antique dealer.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through the queen’s perceptual bias (“disenchanted,” drawn to ember glow). Voice has rhythmic control—shorter sentences during ascent, lyrical cadence in chamber—but occasionally slips into elevated diction (“enigmatic place,” “palpable in the cool evening”) that strains plausibility for a stressed monarch. No dialogue, so voice distinction irrelevant. Free indirect thought is clean, though “softly commanding” appears as label more than demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Elara’s scientifically romantic sensibility—“flickering light,” “directed spontaneity,” “columella curl” all reflect her hybrid lexicon. POV remains stable; Kael’s interiority is inferred only through gesture, avoiding head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Elara’s lines carry urgency and abstraction, Kael’s silence speaks trust. Sentence cadence modulates with ritual intensity, though near-identical openings (“The ember nexus…”) in adjacent paragraphs slightly dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to fragility (brittle scroll, frayed edges) and luminosity (glowing bark, star-strewn expanse). Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during trembling hands, lyrical flow in the dream sequence. Voice remains consistent—no register drift or head-hopping. The only minor slip: past selves speak in near-identical cadence, but this serves thematic mirroring rather than flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s occluded but heightened perception. Voice modulates with emotional intensity: prose tightens during tactile inspection (“turned it in her fingers”), then expands lyrically at realization. No head-hopping; Mira’s dialogue carries distinct vulnerability (“voice trembling”) without over-articulation. The rhythm mirrors water-clock cadence—measured, deliberate—culminating in the soft release of lifted fog. A single filter verb (“she felt”) slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and bodily sensation fitting a rune scholar. Voice modulates rhythmically: long, elastic sentences during reflection contract into terse fragments during crisis (“Not again”). Diction remains within plausible lexicon—no academic intrusions—and syntax mirrors mental state (fragmented during panic, flowing in calm). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls, and free indirect thought integrates seamlessly without filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive, and richly textured, with a perceptual signature attuned to scent, vibration, and archival silence. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during climactic current-channeling. Voice remains consistent, though the metaphor-advising trait isn’t dramatized as a lived practice, only stated. No head-hopping; prose reflects Elara’s blend of professional detachment and personal ache, fulfilling the “ethereal grit” tone through diction and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: prose filters everything through the witness’s paradoxical precision and cosmic scope (“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush”). Syntax modulates—long, coiling sentences mirror spiral arbitration; short phrases mark climax (“The temple trembled”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Elevated diction fits the mythic register without slipping into jargon, though occasional abstraction (“fractured essence of existence”) risks distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and perceptually specific: Elias notices gear edges, mantle key weight, and parchment ink through a craftsman’s lens. Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for reflection, clipped beats for counting—mirroring his mental state. Voice avoids therapy-speak; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“hydraulic clock shepherd” feels lived-in). Minor register drift occurs in “profound sense of peace,” which borders on diagnostic, but overall control remains strong under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s spatially gifted perception (“mapped the farm’s layout effortlessly”). Voice modulates with pressure: shorter sentences during detection, lyrical cadence in revelation. Diction remains consistent—no register drift—and the prose embodies her cognitive style (“laser beam cutting through haze like a scalpel”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct; the figure’s murmur contrasts Elara’s steady tone, carrying subtext without exposition. No head-hopping or focalization errors.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s academic yet yearning sensibility (“theoretically rebellious,” “probability professor’s daughter”). Syntax modulates with emotion: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; shorter clauses during decisive action (“She stood…”).

Prose rhythm mirrors the disc’s crystalline notes: precise, haunting, controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices archival details, textures of memory, botanical and maritime cues. Syntax modulates effectively with emotional cadence, especially in the closing paragraph. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Yet elevated diction (“proximate causes,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) occasionally drifts into academic register inconsistent with an archivist’s immediate sensory experience, creating minor voice leakage in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose has a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices decay with logistical precision (“crumbling buildings”) yet poetic sensitivity (“whispers of what once was”). Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for reflection, tighter phrasing during discovery. Voice remains consistent under pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but warm and purposeful. Slight register drift in “boundless possibilities” edges toward abstraction but doesn’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is flawlessly controlled: blind, tactile, vibrational perception shapes every sentence. Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the forest’s hum and Elara’s determination. Syntax tightens during dowsing (“hands moving as if guided”) and expands in revelation. No head-hopping, filter-verb overuse, or register drift—prose embodies character cognition throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with prose rhythm modulating to mirror Elara’s movements—fluid during signing, still at climax. Distinct perceptual signature: notices light refraction, air vibration, brass gleam. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon (“bittersweet,” “tapestry of emotion” borders elevated but fits advisor role). Final paragraph’s compression (“harbor returned to stillness… silence was no longer empty”) exemplifies voice-as-character.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, reverent register matching “volcanic tenderness.” Syntax varies purposefully, and perceptual focus stays anchored to the arsonist’s analytical intuition. No head-hopping or distance slippage. Yet voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“labyrinth of forgotten knowledge,” “immortalized in paint”) that distances rather than embodies, slightly dulling immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices rhythm, vibration, and light, filtering the world through her experimental condition. Voice modulates effectively: prose tightens during revelation (“The entangled memories weren’t a curse; they were a bridge”) and expands in lyrical passages without losing control. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. The only minor flaw: slight uniformity in sentence rhythm during the reflective block, though not enough to dull pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Eli’s sensory world—clangs, shuffles, warmth of objects. Voice modulates under stress: prose tightens during storm peaks, expands in reflective beats. Mira’s dialogue (“Prove it”) carries subtext and distinct rhythm, avoiding convergence. Minor flaw: “calculated spontaneity” in the climax leans slightly abstract, but overall perceptual signature—sound over sight—remains consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, focalized through the guardian with controlled psychic distance. Voice has distinct rhythm—measured, lyrical, weighted with silence—and modulates subtly during the stranger’s speech. Diction remains character-consistent; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (“Why do you stand here?”). Minor flaw: slight register elevation in phrases like “spiralingly calm” risks distancing, but pattern is taught and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose exhibits a distinct lyric voice with rhythmic control and consistent third-person limited POV. However, perceptual signature blurs during high-momentum passages (e.g., “felt a sense of pride” replaces embodied reaction). No dialogue appears, so voice relies solely on narration, which occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“humble rebellion,” “seeds of doubt”). Still, the voice sustains atmosphere without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature: Elara notices labor details (“calloused hands,” “hauling crates”) and ocean textures (“emerald shafts”). Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action (“She waded in… retrieved”). Voice avoids therapy-speak; diction stays grounded (“boots sinking,” “strange warmth”). No dialogue, so voice distinction irrelevant. Minor register drift in “combative tenderness” (slightly clinical), but earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to decay and mechanical repetition (“blades slicing… monotonous rhythm”). Voice modulates subtly—inner narration grows sharper during whittling (“nothing changes” → “still wood”).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmically controlled, with perceptual signature fixated on light, sound, and dissolution. Syntax modulates under pressure—sentences lengthen during trance-like recitation, tighten post-climax. POV remains stable single-third, with diction (“cobalt atrium,” “lantern-moth hush”) consistent with poetic sensibility. No dialogue avoids pitfalls, but elevated register occasionally drifts into ornate abstraction (“tapestry of the hush”), risking voice over character. Still, prose embodies the poet’s aesthetic drive without head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elias’s sensory bias (noticing vibration before pitch, texture before hue). Prose rhythm modulates with scene needs—longer sentences for contemplation, fragmented beats during the reed’s awakening. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“molten sand,” “tarnished,” “whispers of plants”), avoiding academic drift. No head-hopping; even the glassblower’s dialogue reflects Elias’s perception, not omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound and light. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for immersion, shorter for revelation. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., “waves wash over her”), though occasional elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) risks register drift near peak reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with prose rhythm modulating to match Elara’s emotional cadence (subdued clauses early, fluid syntax post-illumination). Diction stays character-bound (“subdued ardor,” “hollow”), avoiding therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices liquid ink patterns, rain rhythms, and spatial textures through a mystic-analyst hybrid lens. Syntax varies—short clauses during tension, lyrical flow in reflection—without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira’s tremor contrasts Elara’s calm. Voice remains consistent, though “reverse engineering the past” edges toward conceptual register.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and perceptually biased—Elara notices light, texture, silence. Syntax modulates with intensity (longer sentences in reflection, shorter at discovery). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly controlled. Elevated diction (“prismatic surface fractured… liquid gold”) stays within historian’s lexicon. Minor register drift in “atoms of nostalgia” slightly jars, but overall voice sustains lyrical coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices light, texture, and silence over sound or dialogue. Syntax varies purposefully, compressing during descent (“sand shifted… guiding her path”) and expanding in the archive. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from meandering (early wanderings) to resonant cadence at climax (“bathed in the machine’s light”). Perceptual signature is strong—Eamon notices mechanical flora through philosophical longing, not tourist awe. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful (weeks summarized efficiently), and elision (how sixth sense works) serves mystery without obscuring stakes.

    Voice is distinct, lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation matching emotional intensity (“shoreline lullaby,” “serpentine path”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon—no register drift. The prose embodies her perceptual signature: noticing frayed edges, scarred hulls, whispering slopes. Compression is purposeful; every line serves atmosphere, character, or forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a seraphically mundane diction that mirrors Elias’s restraint. Prose modulates subtly—shorter sentences during discovery, lyrical flow in reflection. Voice remains consistent even under pressure. Minor flaw: slight register drift in “unpardonable silence” and “seraphically mundane,” which verge on ornamental rather than character-anchored phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter sentences at climax). POV remains tightly focalized through Elara; no head-hopping. Diction aligns with her scholarly, resolute nature (“regally unpretentious titan” feels earned, not decorative). Dialogue is sparse but sharp, with the pretender’s hissed challenge contrasting Elara’s whisper-weight certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and deeply focalized through Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature—she notices contours, waterlines, and archival traces. Voice modulates rhythmically, especially during tapping sequences, mirroring her cognitive process. Syntax varies purposefully, though one late sentence (“Periodically eternal, the oceans seemed to remind her…”) momentarily slips into abstract register. No head-hopping; prose remains character-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices light, texture, resonance. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for wonder, shorter for resolve. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Minor register drift in “thunderous serenity” edges toward abstraction, but it’s earned by context. The prose trusts implication: rebellion’s failure is shown through scattered fighters, not exposition. Consistent, immersive, and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Mara’s sensory and emotional lens (“mind humming,” “roots spreading like a silent army”). Voice has rhythmic control—short sentences during tension (“The unsealing began with a whisper, then a roar”), lyrical flow in reflection. Diction stays within her lexicon (no academic drift). Guard’s single line feels natural, though his interior remains opaque, which fits situational brevity. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and bodily sensation. Voice modulates effectively—lyrical in description, taut during crisis. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. Minor flaw: slight register drift in “somatic markers” and “resilience of the human spirit,” which feel academic amid otherwise grounded prose. Otherwise, rhythm and diction reflect Zara’s fractured then refocused state.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature steeped in visual and tactile artistry (“vivid,” “splintered,” “luminescent pulse”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; shorter, grounded phrases during action. Voice remains consistent, avoiding head-hopping or register drift. The prose trusts subtext: Elara’s transformation is shown through handling cards and ascending stairs, not declared. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are irrelevant, but interiority avoids exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices terrain, light, mechanical precision. Voice modulates effectively—serene diction under tension, tightening during confrontation (“voice tight”). Drone’s humming provides rhythmic motif. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the woman’s lines carry subtext (“It’s a mirror”). No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.

No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose exhibits a distinct lyric voice with rhythmic control and consistent third-person omniscient distance. Perception filters through poetic abstraction (“brambled hope,” “colossal ribs of some ancient beast”) rather than character-specific bias, flattening focalization. No dialogue appears, sidestepping voice distinction issues. While elegant, narration occasionally drifts into prompt-like phrasing (“motivation was clear,” “strangely trustworthy”), risking committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)

No dialogue, so policy not triggered; compression is purposeful and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, introspective, and rhythmically controlled, with syntax modulating to match Elara’s meditative focus. POV remains tightly focalized; perception is consistently filtered through her intuitively descriptive lens. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is unchallenged.

    The prose maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a perceptual signature attuned to scent, texture, and botanical detail. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity—sentences shorten during the climactic inhalation. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within Elara’s herbalist lexicon. The only flaw: slight over-reliance on adjectival density (“mysterious,” “wildflower hush,” “otherworldly essence”) that occasionally softens immediacy, but never breaks voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on shimmer, pulse, and silence. POV remains tightly controlled in Elara’s perspective, and prose modulates rhythm to match inversion chaos versus grove stillness.

Minor register drift in phrases like “singular convergence” slightly jars the otherwise grounded diction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, deeply interior, and filtered through synesthetic perception—creating a distinct perceptual signature (“saw sound as color”). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter clauses at climax, lyrical flow in exposition. No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narration, which maintains consistent diction and avoids head-hopping. Minor register drift in peak beats (“certify it as essential”) edges toward diagnostic phrasing but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices silence as “alive,” driftwood as guidance, light as judgment. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during approach, lyrical flow during transcendence. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled, first-person limited with a lyrical but consistent voice. Perception is character-specific: Elara notices auroral ripples like “living tapestry,” not generic beauty. Syntax modulates with tension—shorter clauses during ascent, fluid rhythms during reflection. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the scholar’s “You’re late” carries subtext. No head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable. Voice falters only slightly in the final paragraph’s near-expository phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices frost patterns, quartz refractions, emotional residues. Prose rhythm modulates: longer sentences for meditation, shorter for revelation (“She had not expected such intensity”). Voice avoids therapy-speak; diction stays within mystic lexicon (“commune,” “resonance”). No dialogue, so voice distinction irrelevant. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) appear but are sparse and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and tightly aligned with Elara’s wistful perception (“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling”). POV is stable, with controlled psychic distance and perceptual bias (noticing light, texture, quiet). Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during discovery (“As she placed it…”). No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested across speakers, but internal rhythm remains coherent. Minor register drift (“latent sacrifice”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled in close third, filtered through Eli’s blacksmith sensibility—notice of heat, metal, stability. Voice modulates subtly: measured during forging, tense in the mines, hushed at revelation. Dialogue is sparse but functional, the stranger’s “otherworldly cadence” distinct without caricature. Prose rhythm varies effectively, though the mine descent’s compression slightly flattens voice under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and filtered through Elara’s sensory profession, lending specificity to descriptions (“symphony of whispers,” “air thickening like a curtain”). However, prose occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“cyclically spontaneous,” “redirected—through parallel universes”) that distances immediacy. Voice modulates well with wonder, but lacks rhythmic variation under peak stress—sentences remain uniformly lyrical even during disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical yet restrained, matching Elias’s temperament. Perception is selectively filtered—waves, gulls, sea glass—noted with quiet precision. Syntax varies effectively, tightening during discovery (“He turned the glass over…”), then expanding at resolution. No dialogue simplifies control, but the prose occasionally leans into elevated diction (“luminescent ache,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that slightly exceeds the skipper’s plausible lexicon in interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the Herald’s dance-like routine and the beam’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Kael’s artisan sensibility—light, color, texture dominate perception. Voice modulates subtly: shorter sentences during sun-tracking, lyrical flow in reflection. Dialogue carries subtext (her “How do I know?” masks fear of betrayal). No head-hopping, and diction stays within Kael’s plausible lexicon. Only flaw: slight convergence in dialogue rhythm during climax, both voices equally aphoristic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices tools, echoes, and spatial logic first. Voice modulates subtly—longer sentences during reflection, tighter syntax during action—but maintains lyrical consistency. No dialogue simplifies control; prose rhythm mirrors dream-coalescence (e.g., “soft hum of dreams realigning”). Minor risk: elevated diction (“quantified sorrow”) briefly strains lexicon, but context justifies it as occupational idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices light, texture, and silence as deficits. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—shorter clauses during trembling, flowing cadences during song. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or omniscience. The lyric compression is taught early (“woven dawns,” “bound release”) and pays off in closure. Minor register drift in phrases like “resonant reconfiguration” is avoided; diction stays poetic but character-consistent.

No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Elara’s limited knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices botanical decay, bread crusts, worn inscriptions. Voice modulates subtly: shorter sentences during digging, lyrical flow in reflection.

No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests entirely on narrative texture, which remains controlled and character-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s professional precision (“gently meticulous,” “scientific and reverent”). Voice modulates subtly: early prose is measured (“moved with gently meticulous care”), intensifying during the tremor (“air crackled with energy”), then settling into purposeful resolve. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices light frequencies, velvet casings, misted breath—consistent with an archivist. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains character-bound even in lyric moments.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature—Lila notices silences, lies in smiles, and decaying textures.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices scent, taste, and light before emotion or concept.

No head-hopping; psychic distance remains stable and immersive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled, first-person limited with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, shadow, and memory. Voice modulates effectively—from hesitant tremors to decisive strokes—mirroring emotional arc. Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses during tension (“She picked it up”), lyrical flow during revelation. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within artist’s lexicon. The repeated “after the last echo of laughter fades” works as taught refrain, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Consistent close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices textures, light, and decay through her calligrapher’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with prose rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter sentences during miniaturization). Perceptual signature is strong: Elara notices organic textures, light shifts, and mechanical hums. Voice blends lyrical precision (“strangely organic light”) with android detachment, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor flaw: slight register drift in “fragmented wholeness” phrasing, which edges toward diagnostic label, though quickly grounded in action. No dialogue, so voice judged solely on narration—distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Clara’s curator sensibility (“discerning,” drawn to “forgotten objects”). Voice is lyrical but consistent, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Mrs. Ellis’s cadence carries age and secrecy. Minor issue: the phrase “sandstorm calm” in the climax introduces a jarring metaphor not grounded in prior imagery, briefly disrupting perceptual signature.

    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices fractures, patterns, inconsistencies. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: longer sentences for reflection, staccato phrasing during climax (“The ground trembled... reaching for her”). Voice remains consistent, though the chant sequence risks slight register drift into ritualistic diction. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight. Minor deduction for near-uniform sentence openings in exposition beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV is stable, with a distinct lyric-perceptual signature (“stormlit,” “cobalt glass shimmering faintly”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, shorter during activation—but occasionally slips into elevated diction (“variant allegiance,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that strains plausibility for a weary visionary.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptive lens (“brightly attentive” shapes what she notices). Voice modulates with tension—shorter sentences during the lockout, lyrical flow during the song sync. Syntax reflects her analytical yet intuitive mind. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don’t apply. Prose avoids filter verbs and maintains consistent diction; the perceptual signature (noticing patterns, sensing absences) is character-specific and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable and immersive, filtered through Elara’s calmly intuitive perception. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and a distinct perceptual signature (noticing shifting frames, rippling glass, opaque surfaces). No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. Prose modulates with emotional intensity—sentences shorten during revelations (“She saw…”, “The image faded…”)—and maintains consistency through the climax. A minor flaw: slight register drift into elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “otherworldly energy”) that borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise—with a perceptual signature fixated on fragility and impermanence. Syntax modulates effectively: short, crisp sentences during tension (“Her heart skipped a beat”), flowing cadences in reflection. POV remains tightly focalized; even dialogue (Mara’s steady lines) feels filtered through Elara’s lens. No head-hopping or register drift, though the final paragraph’s “promise of peace” verges on slight overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to amber light, vine symmetry, and tactile memory. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; tighter phrasing during moments of realization. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s reverence. Syntax varies purposefully (short ritual phrases vs. flowing description), and perceptual signature (“peripheral awareness,” “whisperfield calm”) feels character-specific. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Elevated diction suits the mythic register without straying from plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters everything through Elara’s archival sensibility (“arcs of black-and-white photographs,” “dove gray map case”). Syntax varies purposefully, slowing for reflection, tightening at dusk. POV is stable, interiority concrete (“fingers brushing petals”), and diction remains within her plausible lexicon. No head-hopping, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity without losing control.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical but precise, with rhythmic control that breathes with Elias’s focus (short sentences during tension, flowing clauses in reflection). Perceptual signature is strong—Elias notices sonic textures, not visual grandeur. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within scholar’s lexicon (“reticent,” “sonically reflective”) without academic drift. Minor deduction: one or two filter verbs (“he felt,” “he knew”) slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is flawlessly controlled third-limited, filtering every detail through Elias’s precognitive sieve (“mind a prism for the future”). Syntax mirrors cognitive rhythm: short clauses during disorientation (“He closed his eyes”), lyrical spirals in reflection. Voice avoids therapy-speak; even “tidal longing” feels earned through bodily verbs (“pulling him forward”). No head-hopping, and perceptual signature (noticing directional gestures in stone) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: precise, lyrical, with a repairer’s tactile lexicon (“gears,” “springs,” “workbench”). POV is stable single-third, modulating rhythm—longer sentences for reflection, shorter during action. No dialogue, so speech tests don’t apply. Prose mirrors Elara’s mindset: calm syntax during stillness, subtle acceleration during tremors. Minor register drift in “escape velocity” risks jargon but is grounded in her metaphorical insight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable, third-person limited through Elara, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound, scent, and silence. Prose rhythm modulates effectively—longer sentences for reflection, shorter during action—but occasionally drifts into elevated diction (“pulsing stillness,” “hymning the mundane”) that feels imposed rather than character-earned. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent, though the lyric register risks slight artifice in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose exhibits strong perceptual signature—Elara notices etchings, grooves, resonances—with syntax modulating subtly between contemplative (longer sentences in study) and taut (activation at noon). POV is stable, third-person limited, with no head-hopping or leakage. Voice remains consistent, avoiding exposition or diagnostic labels, though occasional phrases (“quietly deliberate,” “forgotten magic”) verge on ornamental. No dialogue simplifies evaluation, but internal rhythm supports pressure without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a lyrical, slightly elevated register fitting Elara’s reflective nature. Voice modulates with intensity (e.g., “hum” of the tooth vs. “cascade of light”), and perceptual signature is clear—she notices logic-defying hedges, translucent enamel, symbolic stones. No dialogue limits voice testing, but prose rhythm varies purposefully. Minor register drift occurs in “nostalgic innovation,” which feels authorial rather than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a lyrical, reflective cadence suited to Lira’s contemplative nature. Voice modulates subtly—from hushed recollection to focused intensity during polishing—without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices weight, texture, color shifts, not abstractions. No dialogue to evaluate, but prose rhythm supports emotional arc. Minor deduction for occasional over-polished phrasing (“zephyr bloom of her spirit”) that borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with tension (shorter sentences during apparitions). POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s sensory and emotional filters, with no leakage. Prose reflects her novelist mind (“echoes of lives lived against the current”) without over-intellectualizing under stress. Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing slightly distances immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices gears, liquids, and vine textures like a maker. Voice modulates rhythmically—shorter sentences during humming, lyrical flow during revelation. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“whimsical tinkerer” never slips into academic jargon). Minor flaw: passive constructions (“was transformed”) dilute immediacy in the climax, but overall control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Elara’s alchemical sensibility, with syntax modulating to mirror ritual cadence. Prose avoids head-hopping and maintains tight focalization; perceptual signature is evident in how she “hears” objects whisper purpose. The lyric register is sustained without slipping into exposition or diagnostic language. Minor deduction for slight uniformity in sentence openings during the sealing sequence, but overall control under pressure is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices reflections, angles, mechanical rhythms. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter for breakthroughs. No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narration, which stays tightly focalized. Elevated diction (“sanctuary,” “resonant hum”) fits the tone but occasionally borders on ornate; the phrase “store wonder in the cellar of reason” verges on abstract. Still, rhythm supports pressure, and POV modesty is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature that blends tactile precision (“metal biting into her palm”) and lyrical abstraction (“whalebone reverie”). Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during the figure’s challenge (“What do you want from me?”), then expands into fluid introspection at closure. Diction remains character-consistent (no academic intrusions), and the lamp’s physicality anchors even ethereal concepts. Dialogue carries subtext: the figure’s questions probe Elara’s blind spots without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and silence.

POV remains stable, with perceptual bias evident in how Mara notices only salvageable fragments. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, though one or two phrases (“fractured stillness”) verge on repeated abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Eli notices airflow, structural stress points, light angles—engineer’s attention. Voice modulates subtly: lyrical in observation (“ghosts of travelers past”), precise in action (“propped up mirrors”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Minor register drift in “maze of intentions” (slightly academic), but overall rhythmic control supports accumulation without monotony or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)

Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the whisper’s climax (“bear”), lyrical flow during reflection. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“excruciatingly gentle,” not academic). The prose-as-character principle shines: rhythmic precision mirrors clockwork, yet never feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices silence, texture, and light with poetic precision (“surface a mirror reflecting the faint glow of the stars”). Syntax varies purposefully, slowing for reflection, tightening during discovery. No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested across characters.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices mechanisms, textures, and temporal rhythms. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for reflection, shorter ones for realization—and diction stays within his plausible lexicon (“calloused,” “reverence,” “searing reverie”). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains consistent psychic distance. Minor deduction for one late flourish (“incremental grace”) that slightly exceeds his voice, but overall, rhythm and imagery cohere under pressure without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Elias’s poetic sensibility (“velveteen gloom,” “silent melody”). Syntax modulates with intensity—longer sentences during discovery, shorter at climax. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register (“resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing like “charted emotions”) that slightly exceeds a gardener’s plausible lexicon, though voice-motivated as lyrical introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits strong perceptual signature: Ignorance notices reflective surfaces (spire, lake, ink) that mirror thematic duality. Rhythm modulates effectively—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter bursts during writing frenzy. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within cartographer-poet lexicon (“groundedly imaginative,” “cascade of possibility”), though “iridescent blues and greens shimmering” slightly over-ornaments peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices precision, decay, and time-related artifacts first. Voice modulates subtly—from brittle control to hesitant openness—though prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction (“sedimentary layers,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that strains against Kael’s likely lexicon. Dialogue distinguishes Lira’s pragmatic cadence from Kael’s philosophical stiffness, carrying subtext effectively. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent, though free indirect style could be leaner in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)

She...” near climax slightly flattens intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct observational register (“sharp-eyed,” “fractured colors”). Voice modulates subtly with Kael’s focus shifts, though emotional range stays narrow. Drone interface scenes integrate tech naturally without jarring diction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: Elias’s measured cadence contrasts Mara’s needle-sharp brevity, and narration filters everything through Elias’s perceptual bias (light fractures, mechanical precision). Prose modulates rhythm with debate intensity—longer sentences during exposition, clipped phrases in retorts. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored. Slight register drift in “dignified chaos” risks abstraction, but prismatic imagery grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices stories in patches, verses in scraps, light in fractures. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; tighter phrasing for action. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with disciplined focalization. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (“Do you ever feel like we’re just patching things up?”). Prose rhythm supports emotional cadence without slipping into monotony or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., short clauses during discovery, flowing cadence in reflection). POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices musical textures, mechanical stillness, directional uncertainty. No dialogue, so speech distinctions irrelevant. Minor flaw: slight register drift in “kaleidoscope of colors” and “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing, but not enough to break immersion or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose has a distinct lyric texture—“air shimmered with the promise of life,” “blooms opening and closing as if in rhythm with her heartbeat”—filtered through Elara’s observant, empirically whimsical POV. Voice remains consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the creature’s chorus-of-whispers distinguishes it without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, third-person limited, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elias’s bonsai practice: noticing texture, rhythm, growth. Prose modulates—longer sentences in reflection, shorter during treacherous walk—mirroring emotional cadence. Voice is distinct, lyrical but precise (“rhythmically placid melody,” “diffuse through him like a gentle breeze”). No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Elias’s knowledge and sensory field.
